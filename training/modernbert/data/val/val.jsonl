The measure at issue states that, to be classified as a ‘foreign company’, a company must be liable to pay a tax that is identical to the tax applicable in Spain and its income must derive mainly from business activities carried out abroad.\n\n6\n\n\nIn paragraphs 10 to 13 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission, which are identical to paragraphs 15 to 18 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court added the following:\n\n‘10\n\n\nIt follows from the [first] contested decision that, under Spanish law, a business combination is an operation whereby one or more companies, on being dissolved without going into liquidation, transfer all their assets and liabilities to another existing company or to a company that they form in exchange for the issue to their shareholders of securities representing the capital of that other company (recital 23 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 32 of the second contested decision]).\n\n11\n\n\nIn the [first] contested decision, share acquisition is to mean an operation whereby one company acquires a shareholding in the capital of another company without obtaining a majority or the control of the voting rights of the target company (recital 23 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 32 of the second contested decision]).\n\n12\n\n\nFurthermore, it is stated in the [first] contested decision that, according to the measure at issue, the financial goodwill is determined by deducting the market value of the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired company from the acquisition price paid for the shareholding. It is also stated that the concept of financial goodwill, as referred to in the measure at issue, introduces into the field of share acquisitions a concept that is usually used in transfers of assets or business combination transactions (recital 20 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 29 of the second contested decision]).\n\n13\n\n\nFinally, it should be noted that under Spanish tax law, the acquisition by an undertaking which is taxable in Spain of a shareholding in a company established in Spain does not allow the goodwill resulting from that acquisition to be recorded separately for tax purposes. However, again according to Spanish tax law, goodwill can be amortised [only in the case of] a business combination (recital 19 of the [first] contested decision[, identical to recital 28 of the second contested decision]).’\n\n7\n\n\nBy the first contested decision, the Commission concluded the procedure with respect to shareholding acquisitions within the European Union.\n\n8\n\n\nIn Article 1(1) of that decision, the Commission declared incompatible with the common market the scheme introduced by the measure at issue (‘the scheme at issue’), whereby a tax advantage was granted to undertakings taxable in Spain in order to enable them to amortise the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shareholdings in foreign undertakings, where it was applied to acquisitions of shareholdings in undertakings established within the European Union. In Article 4 of that decision, the Commission ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid granted under that scheme.\n\n9\n\n\nThe Commission maintained open, however, the procedure as regards acquisitions of shareholdings outside the European Union, the Spanish authorities having given an undertaking that they would provide further details concerning the obstacles to cross-border mergers outside the European Union.\n\n10\n\n\nBy the second contested decision, the Commission declared incompatible with the common market the scheme at issue, whereby a tax advantage was granted to undertakings taxable in Spain in order to enable them to amortise the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shareholdings in foreign undertakings, where it applied to acquisitions of shareholdings in undertakings established outside the European Union (Article 1(1) of that decision), and ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid granted under that scheme (Article 4 of that decision).\n\nThe procedure before the General Court and the judgments under appeal\n\n11\n\n\n By an application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 May 2010, Autogrill España SA, now World Duty Free Group SA (‘WDFG’), brought an action seeking the annulment of Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the first contested decision. \n\n12\n\n\nIn support of its action in so far as it is directed against Article 1(1) of that decision, WDFG relied on four pleas in law: (i) an error of law in the Commission’s application of the condition relating to selectivity; (ii) the measure at issue is not selective in so far as the differentiation that it introduces flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which it is part; (iii) the measure provides no advantage to companies to which the scheme at issue applies; and (iv) with respect to both the criterion relating to selectivity and that relating to the existence of an advantage, a failure to state adequate reasons for that decision.\n\n13\n\n\nBy an application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 29 July 2011,  Banco Santander SA and Santusa Holding SL (‘Santusa’) brought an action seeking the annulment of Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the second contested decision. \n\n14\n\n\nIn support of their action in so far as directed against Article 1(1) of that decision, Banco Santander and Santusa relied on five pleas in law: (i) an error of law in the Commission’s application of the condition relating to selectivity; (ii) an error in identifying the reference system; (iii) the measure at issue is not selective in so far as the differentiation that it introduces is a result of the nature or general structure of the system of which it is part; (iv) the measure provides no advantage to the companies to which the scheme at issue applies; and (v) with respect to both the criterion relating to selectivity and that relating to the existence of an advantage, a failure to state adequate reasons for the contested decision.\n\n15\n\n\nIn the judgments under appeal, the General Court, on essentially identical grounds, upheld the first plea of law in each of the two actions, namely that Article 107(1) TFEU had been misapplied with respect to the condition relating to selectivity, and consequently annulled Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the contested decisions, without examining the other pleas raised in those actions. \n\nForm of order sought by the parties and procedures before the Court\n\n16\n\n\nThe Commission claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgments under appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nrefer the respective cases back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\nreserve the costs. \n\n17\n\n\nWDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P, contend that the Court should dismiss the appeals, uphold the judgments under appeal and order the Commission to pay the costs.\n\n18\n\n\nBy decisions of the President of the Court of 19 May 2015, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain were granted leave to intervene in support of the forms of order sought by WDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and by Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P.\n\n19\n\n\nOn the other hand, by orders of the President of the Court of 6 October 2015, the applications of Telefónica SA and Iberdrola SA for leave to intervene in support of the forms of order sought by WDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and by Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P, were refused.\n\nThe appeals\n\n20\n\n\nIn support of its appeals, the Commission relies on a single ground of appeal, which has two parts, consisting of the claim that the General Court erred in law in the interpretation of the condition relating to selectivity as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU. \n\nThe first part of the single ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n21\n\n\nBy the first part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law by holding that the Commission was obliged, in order to demonstrate that a measure is selective, to identify a group of undertakings with specific characteristics.\n\n22\n\n\nThe Commission maintains that, in the contested decisions, it rigorously followed the method for the analysis of selectivity in tax matters, as that method is set out in the Court’s settled case-law. The Commission accordingly established that the measure at issue constituted a derogation from a reference system, in that the effect of the measure was that the tax treatment of undertakings taxable in Spain acquiring shareholdings of at least 5% in companies established outside Spain differed from that applicable to undertakings taxable in Spain making identical acquisitions in companies established in Spain, although those two categories of undertakings were in comparable situations in the light of the objective pursued by the general Spanish system for the taxation of companies.\n\n23\n\n\nThe Commission considers that the General Court, by imposing on it the additional obligation of demonstrating that the measure at issue favours certain undertakings capable of identification by reason of characteristics specific to them that other undertakings do not possess, in other words ex ante identifiable features that are characteristic of them, erred in law, since, in so doing, the General Court attributed a meaning to the condition relating to selectivity that is more restrictive than that defined by the Court.\n\n24\n\n\nThe Commission maintains, in particular, that, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraphs 57 and 58 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 61 and 62 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, measures can be classified as selective even if those measures are to be applied regardless of the nature of the activities of the beneficiary and create a tax advantage for certain investment transactions without setting a minimum investment amount.\n\n25\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, in that context, the General Court erred in inferring from the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that a national measure which is to be applied regardless of the nature of the activity of undertakings is not, a priori, selective. The statement in paragraph 36 of that judgment, that ‘national measures such as those at issue in the main proceedings do not constitute State aid … if they apply to all undertakings in national territory, regardless of their activity’ should be understood to mean that the reason why there is no selectivity is that the national measure applies indiscriminately to all undertakings in the Member State concerned.\n\n26\n\n\nThe Commission also claims that the General Court erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 59 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 63 to 66 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that a measure such as the measure at issue is not selective where it is linked to the purchase of particular financial assets, namely shareholdings in foreign companies, and where no category of undertakings is, a priori, excluded from benefiting from it.\n\n27\n\n\nThe Commission submits that the General Court wrongly relied in this regard on the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467). It follows from paragraphs 22 and 23 of that judgment that, in the case which gave rise to it, the Commission had classified the measure concerned as selective only in relation to certain geographically defined undertakings in which private investors had reinvested the profits from the sale of economic assets and not in relation to those investors themselves, for whom it had held that that measure did not constitute aid.\n\n28\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission criticises the General Court for having held, in paragraphs 66 to 68 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 70 to 72 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that it would be contrary to the case-law of the Court of Justice to regard as selective a national tax measure the benefit of which is subject to certain conditions, even though the beneficiary undertakings do not share any feature characteristic of them that distinguishes them from other undertakings, apart from the fact that they are capable of satisfying the conditions governing the application of the measure.\n\n29\n\n\nThe Commission submits that the General Court relies in that regard on an erroneous analysis of the case-law concerned.\n\n30\n\n\nWith respect to the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), the Commission argues that it is clear from paragraphs 90 and 91 of that judgment that that case concerned a particular situation in which the Court considered the reference tax system itself to be selective, in that it favoured ‘offshore’ undertakings as such, rather than any derogation from it. The reference made in that judgment to the ‘specific properties’ of a category of undertakings should therefore be understood as referring to the characteristics by reason of which those undertakings were favoured for tax purposes under a reference system that was inherently selective and cannot be extrapolated beyond that particular context.\n\n31\n\n\nAs regards paragraph 42 of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), the General Court failed to take into account the second sentence of that paragraph, which sets out the principle, enshrined in the Court’s settled case-law, that a measure is selective if it is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings, who are, in the light of the objective pursued by the scheme, in a comparable factual and legal situation.\n\n32\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa submit, first, that the Commission did not maintain, in the contested decisions, that the measure at issue was de facto selective, and, consequently, the present appeals are concerned only with examining the criticisms directed against the judgments under appeal to the effect that the General Court held that the grounds relied on by the Commission in those decisions did not support the conclusion that that measure was de jure selective.\n\n33\n\n\nThey contend that it follows from the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that a measure from which all undertakings can benefit cannot be considered to be selective. That judgment does not however permit the inference, as claimed by the Commission, that a national measure is not selective where it applies to all the undertakings in a Member State without exception, since, if that argument were valid, almost all tax rules would have to be considered to be selective.\n\n34\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa also dispute the Commission’s argument that national tax measures have on many occasions previously been classified as selective even though they set no minimum investment amount and applied regardless of the nature of the beneficiary’s activities. In any event, the measure at issue, in that it confers a tax advantage on any undertaking that wishes to benefit from it, irrespective of which category it falls into, for that reason alone cannot be deemed to be prima facie and de jure selective.\n\n35\n\n\nThe General Court was correct to rely on the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), since, in the decision that was at issue in that judgment, the Commission had expressly accepted that the national measure was not selective as regards the investors concerned, a position confirmed by the Court.\n\n36\n\n\nIn its decision-making practice, moreover, the Commission has on many occasions previously found tax measures not to be selective on the basis of the same criterion, in other words that general measures which are applicable to all undertakings without distinction and of which all taxable persons may take advantage are not selective.\n\n37\n\n\nWhat is more, the application of that criterion would not lead to a finding that measures relating to the purchase of certain assets as referred to by the Commission were not selective. Such measures could be classified as selective if it were shown that they do in fact benefit certain undertakings to the exclusion of others. In any event, their selectivity would follow not from the nature of the assets acquired but from the fact that it is legitimate to hold that the purchasers concerned form a particular category.\n\n38\n\n\nWith regard to the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa take the view that the General Court was right to consider that the measure at issue in the case which gave rise to that judgment differs from that in the present case, since it was intended to confer an advantage on a distinct and identifiable category of undertakings, that is to say those engaged in exporting.\n\n39\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa further submit that it follows clearly from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), and in particular paragraph 104 thereof, that a measure can be classified as selective only if it benefits a category of undertakings sharing ‘properties’ which are ‘specific’ to them. It follows moreover from that judgment that the identification of a derogation from an ordinary system is not an end in itself. All that matters is the actual effect of the measure, namely the fact that it does or does not benefit specific undertakings or the production of specific goods.\n\n40\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa argue that the interpretation of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), advocated by the Commission, can again not be accepted. First, in that judgment, the Court did not uphold the definition of a reference system and a derogation from that system. Second, that judgment does not permit a conclusion that a measure is selective by reason of the fact that the undertakings which satisfy the conditions to benefit from that measure form a distinct category.\n\n41\n\n\nLast, the General Court was correct to hold that a measure cannot be classified as selective, within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU, if the benefit of that measure depends on conduct that is prima facie open to any undertaking, irrespective of an undertaking’s sector of activity. That follows from the finding, in the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), that a national measure was not selective as regards investors.\n\n42\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain submits that the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598) confirms the position taken by the Spanish authorities during the administrative procedure before the Commission, to the effect that an economic advantage can be classified as aid only if it is capable of favouring ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n43\n\n\nIn the course of that administrative procedure, the Spanish authorities demonstrated that the measure at issue was generally accessible, on the ground that it was applied to undertakings active in very different business sectors, thereby supporting the analysis set out in the judgments under appeal and the fact that the Commission had failed in the contested decisions to demonstrate that that measure was selective.\n\n44\n\n\nIreland submits that, contrary to what is argued by the Commission, the General Court did not infer from the judgment of the Court of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), and the judgments of the General Court of 6 March 2002, Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission (T‑92/00 and T‑103/00, EU:T:2002:61), and of 9 September 2009, Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission (T‑227/01 to T‑229/01, T‑265/01, T‑266/01 and T‑270/01, EU:T:2009:315), that only measures the application of which was linked to the nature of the undertaking’s activities or the application of which was dependent on a minimum amount were selective, but held that selectivity could not be established with respect to a measure from which all undertakings resident for tax purposes in Spain and making acquisitions of at least 5% shareholdings in foreign undertakings could benefit, regardless of the nature of their activities and the amounts invested.\n\n45\n\n\nThe General Court was correct to rely on the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), in order to hold that it was necessary, if different tax treatment was to be classified as aid, that a particular category of undertakings capable of benefiting should be identified, by reason of their specific properties. The condition relating to selectivity as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU should moreover be defined in the same way in all cases concerning alleged State aid of a fiscal nature. Accordingly, the principle expressly stated in paragraph 104 of that judgment cannot be limited to a situation in which a tax system taken as a whole is selective.\n\n46\n\n\nIreland considers that measures such as the measure at issue, which do not a priori exclude any undertaking or any particular economic sector from the ambit of its recipients, cannot be regarded as being selective. The Commission has on several occasions previously relied on that ground in order to determine that certain national measures are not selective.\n\n47\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany submits that the existence, even if it were established, of a derogation from or exception to the reference framework identified by the Commission is not, in itself, sufficient to conclude that the measure at issue favours ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n48\n\n\nOn the contrary, it follows only that that measure is similar to a subsidy. Consequently, after an examination designed to determine that the measure has the nature of a derogation, it is appropriate, in accordance with the case-law and, in particular, the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), and as the General Court correctly held in the judgments under appeal, thereafter to determine whether the category of taxpayers favoured by a tax measure involves sufficiently specific undertakings or the production of sufficiently specific goods within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows accordingly from the Court’s case-law that the category of undertakings which receive a tax advantage is sufficiently specified where the Commission has been able to demonstrate that the advantage concerned was for the benefit of only undertakings belonging to a single economic sector and carrying out particular transactions (judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774), only undertakings that have a particular legal form (judgment of 10 January 2006, Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others, C‑222/04, EU:C:2006:8), only undertakings of a certain size (judgment of 13 February 2003, Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92) or only undertakings resident for tax purposes outside the territory of a region (judgment of 17 November 2009Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri, C‑169/08, EU:C:2009:709).\n\n50\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany recalls that the Court has previously held that a tax concession in favour of taxpayers who sell certain financial assets and can offset the resulting profit when they acquire other financial assets confers on them an advantage which, as a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators, cannot be classified as State aid (judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission, C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467, paragraph 22).\n\n51\n\n\nA fortiori, therefore, a tax measure such as that at issue, the application of which is generally linked to a certain category of transactions falling within the scope of company law, in this instance the acquisition of shareholdings, regardless of the object and business activities of the undertaking, should not be considered to be selective.\n\n52\n\n\nLast, the Member States intervening in these cases submit that, if the selectivity of a national measure as a condition for its classification as State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, were to be understood in the broad sense advocated by the Commission in its appeals, the consequence would be an undermining of the division of powers within the European Union. If such scope were to be conferred on the selectivity condition, the Commission could review almost all direct tax measures by virtue of its powers in the field of State aid, although direct taxation falls, as a general rule, within the legislative competence of the Member States.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n53\n\n\n First, it must be recalled that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, classification of a national measure as ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, requires all the following conditions to be fulfilled. First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources. Second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between the Member States. Third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient. Fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, inter alia, judgment of 16 July 2015, BVVG, C‑39/14, EU:C:2015:470, paragraph 24).\n\n54\n\n\nSo far as concerns the condition relating to the selectivity of the advantage, which is a constituent factor in the concept of ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, it is clear from equally settled case-law of the Court that  the assessment of that condition requires a determination whether, under a particular legal regime, a national measure is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation and who accordingly suffer different treatment that can, in essence, be classified as discriminatory  (see, inter alia, judgments of 28 July 2011, Mediaset v Commission, C‑403/10 P, not published, EU:C:2011:533, paragraph 36; of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 75 and 101; and of 14 January 2015, Eventech, C‑518/13, EU:C:2015:9, paragraphs 53 to 55; and of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C‑15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 59).\n\n55\n\n\nFurther, where the measure at issue is conceived as an aid scheme and not as individual aid, it is for the Commission to establish that that measure, although it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or certain sectors of activity (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraphs 49 and 50).\n\n56\n\n\nAs regards, in particular,  national measures that confer a tax advantage, it must be recalled that a measure of that nature which, although not involving the transfer of State resources, places the recipients in a more favourable position than other taxpayers is capable of procuring a selective advantage for the recipients and, consequently, of constituting State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.On the other hand, a tax advantage resulting from a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators does not constitute such aid  (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 18 July 2013, P,C‑6/12, EU:C:2013:525, paragraph 18).\n\n57\n\n\nIn that context, in order to classify a national tax measure as ‘selective’, the Commission must begin by identifying the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, and thereafter demonstrate that the tax measure at issue is a derogation from that ordinary system, in so far as it differentiates between operators who, in the light of the objective pursued by that ordinary tax system, are in a comparable factual and legal situation (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraph 49).\n\n58\n\n\nThe concept of ‘State aid’ does not, however, cover measures that differentiate between undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by the legal regime concerned, are in a comparable factual and legal situation, and are, therefore, a priori selective, where the Member State concerned is able to demonstrate that that differentiation is justified since it flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which the measures form part (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgments of 29 April 2004, Netherlands v Commission, C‑159/01, EU:C:2004:246, paragraphs 42 and 43; of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraphs 64 and 65; and of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 40).\n\n59\n\n\nFurther, it must be recalled that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for the application of a measure can benefit from the measure cannot, in itself, make it into a selective measure (judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 42).\n\n60\n\n\nIt follows from all the foregoing that  the appropriate criterion for establishing the selectivity of the measure at issue consists in determining whether that measure introduces, between operators that are, in the light of the objective pursued by the general tax system concerned, in a comparable factual and legal situation, a distinction that is not justified by the nature and general structure of that system  (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C‑15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 61).\n61\n\n\nThose are the factors that must guide the Court’s examination of whether, in this case, the General Court misconstrued Article 107(1) TFEU, as interpreted by the Court, by holding that the Commission had not, in the contested decisions, demonstrated to the requisite legal standard that the measure at issue conferred a selective advantage on ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’.\n\n62\n\n\nIn this case, the measure at issue confers a tax advantage that consists in a deduction from the taxable base for corporation tax in the form of an amortisation of the goodwill resulting from the acquisition by undertakings resident for tax purposes in Spain of at least 5% shareholdings in undertakings resident for tax purposes outside that Member State. That measure must, since it is capable of conferring an advantage on all such undertakings which carry out such transactions, be regarded as capable of constituting an aid scheme. It was therefore for the Commission to establish that that measure, notwithstanding that it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or on certain sectors of activity.\n\n63\n\n\nIn that regard, the General Court stated, in paragraph 50 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 54 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Commission, in order to establish that the measure at issue was selective, had primarily relied, in the contested decisions, on the ground that that measure constitutes a derogation from a reference system, in that the effect of that measure was the application to undertakings taxable in Spain, acquiring shareholdings in companies established outside Spain, of a tax treatment that differed from that applied to undertakings taxable in Spain making such acquisitions in companies established in Spain, although those two categories of undertakings were in comparable situations in the light of the objective pursued by that reference system, namely the general Spanish system for the taxation of companies and, more specifically, the rules relating to the tax treatment of financial goodwill within that tax system.\n\n64\n\n\nThe General Court held, in paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Commission had thereby applied the analytical method that may be deduced from the case-law of the Court and of the General Court cited, respectively, in paragraphs 29 to 33 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 33 to 37 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, which essentially corresponds to the Court’s case-law cited in paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment.\n\n65\n\n\nHowever, in paragraphs 44, 45, 52 and 53 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 48, 49, 56 and 57 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court held that the existence, were it to be established, of a derogation or an exception to the reference system identified by the Commission was not sufficient, in itself, to establish that the measure at issue favoured ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, since that measure was accessible, a priori, to any undertaking and it was directed not to a particular category of undertakings, which would have been the only undertakings favoured by that measure, but to a category of economic transactions.\n\n66\n\n\nIt is, however, clear that that reasoning is based on a misapplication of the selectivity condition laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU, as described in this judgment.\n\n67\n\n\nAs is apparent from paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment,  with respect to a national measure conferring a tax advantage of general application, such as the measure at issue, that condition is satisfied where the Commission is able to demonstrate that that measure is a derogation from the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, thereby introducing, through its actual effects, differences in the treatment of operators, although the operators who qualify for the tax advantage and those who do not are, in the light of the objective pursued by that Member State’s tax system, in a comparable factual and legal situation.\n\n68\n\n\nIt is apparent from the judgments under appeal that the Commission relied, in the contested decisions, in order to establish that the measure at issue was selective, on the fact that the consequence of that measure was that resident undertakings were not treated equally. Pursuant to that measure, only resident undertakings who acquired at least 5% shareholdings in foreign companies could, under certain conditions, qualify for the tax advantage at issue, whereas resident undertakings making the acquisition of such a shareholding in undertakings taxable in Spain could not obtain that advantage, notwithstanding the fact that, according to the Commission, they were in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary Spanish tax system.\n\n69\n\n\nHowever, the General Court considered that the measure at issue, on the grounds that it did not affect any particular category of undertakings or the production of any particular category of goods, that it was applicable regardless of the nature of an undertaking’s activity and that it was accessible, a priori or potentially, to all undertakings that wanted to acquire shareholdings of at least 5% in foreign companies and that held those shareholdings without interruption for at least one year, had to be regarded not as a selective measure but as a general measure within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 56 of this judgment. In so doing, the General Court erred in law.\n\n70\n\n\nThus, in paragraphs 41, 45, 67 and 68 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 45, 49, 71 and 72 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court held that, if the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure relevant to the recognition of State aid, in respect of a measure that is a priori accessible to any undertaking, is to be satisfied, it is always necessary that a particular category of undertakings, who are exclusively favoured by the measure concerned and who can be distinguished by reason of specific properties, common to them and characteristic of them, be identified.\n\n71\n\n\nHowever, the imposition of such a supplementary requirement to identify a particular category of undertakings, additional to the analytical method applicable to selectivity in tax matters that may be deduced from the Court’s settled case-law, which essentially involves ascertaining whether the exclusion of certain operators from the benefit of a tax advantage that arises from a measure derogating from an ordinary tax system constitutes discrimination with respect to those operators, cannot be inferred from the Court’s case-law and, in particular, from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732).\n\n72\n\n\nIt is true that, in paragraph 104 of that judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), the Court held that, in order to be capable of being recognised as conferring selective advantages, the criteria forming the basis of assessment which are adopted by a tax system must be such as to characterise the recipient undertakings, by virtue of properties which are specific to them, as a privileged category, thus permitting such a regime to be described as favouring ‘certain’ undertakings or the production of ‘certain’ goods, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n73\n\n\nHowever, that ground of the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), must be read in the context of the set of grounds of which it forms part, set out in paragraphs 87 to 108 of that judgment.\n\n74\n\n\nIt follows from a reading of all those grounds that the measure at issue in that judgment did not take the form of a tax advantage that derogated from an ordinary tax system, but rather involved the application of a ‘general’ tax scheme based on criteria that were, in themselves, also general. The Court held that the nature of that scheme did not preclude a finding that the measure concerned was selective, contrary to the ruling of the General Court, since the condition relating to selectivity has a broader scope that extends to measures which, by their effects, favour certain undertakings, in that case ‘offshore’ companies, on account of the specific features characteristic of those undertakings. That measure accordingly operated de facto discrimination against undertakings that were in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, in that case the objective of putting in place generalised taxation of all resident companies.\n\n75\n\n\nBy contrast, as stated above in paragraph 63 of this judgment, in the contested decisions, the Commission, in order to establish the selectivity of the measure at issue, relied primarily on the ground that the consequence of that measure is discrimination, in that it confers a tax advantage on certain resident undertakings and not on others who are subject to the same ordinary tax system from which the measure at issue is a derogation.\n\n76\n\n\nWhile it therefore follows from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), that the selectivity of a tax measure can be established even if that measure does not constitute a derogation from an ordinary tax system, but is an integral part of that system, the fact remains that that judgment is consistent with the Court’s settled case-law, cited in paragraph 57 of this judgment, to the effect that it is sufficient, in order to establish the selectivity of a measure that derogates from an ordinary tax system, to demonstrate that that measure benefits certain operators and not others, although all those operators are in an objectively comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary tax system.\n\n77\n\n\nIndeed, while it is not always necessary that a tax measure, in order for it to be established that it is selective, should derogate from an ordinary tax system, the fact that it can be so characterised is highly relevant in that regard where the effect of that measure is that two categories of operators are distinguished and are subject, a priori, to different treatment, namely those who fall within the scope of the derogating measure and those who continue to fall within the scope of the ordinary tax system, although those two categories are in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by that system.\n78\n\n\nContrary to what was held by the General Court in the judgments under appeal,  neither can it be required of the Commission, in order to establish the selectivity of such a measure, that it should identify certain specific features that are characteristic of and common to the undertakings that are the recipients of the tax advantage, by which they can be distinguished from those undertakings that are excluded from the advantage.\n\n79\n\n\nAll that matters in that regard is the fact that the measure, irrespective of its form or the legislative means used, should have the effect of placing the recipient undertakings in a position that is more favourable than that of other undertakings, although all those undertakings are in a comparable factual and legal situation in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned.\n80\n\n\nFurther, according to the Court’s settled case-law, the fact that the number of undertakings able to claim entitlement under a national measure is very large, or that those undertakings belong to various economic sectors, is not sufficient to call into question the selective nature of that measure and, therefore, to rule out its classification as State aid (see, inter alia, judgments of 13 February 2003, Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92, paragraph 48, and of 8 September 2011, Commission v Netherlands, C‑279/08 P, EU:C:2011:551, paragraph 50).\n\n81\n\n\nAccordingly, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraphs 53 to 58 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 57 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the potentially selective nature of the measure at issue is in no way called into question by the fact that the essential condition for obtaining the tax advantage conferred by that measure is that there should be an economic transaction, more particularly an ‘entirely financial’ transaction, for which no minimum investment is required and which is available regardless of the nature of the business of the recipient undertakings.\n\n82\n\n\nIn that context, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraph 57 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 61 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, it cannot be inferred from paragraph 36 of the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), according to which measures are not selective where they apply to all the undertakings in the national territory, ‘regardless of their activity’, that a measure whose application does not depend on the nature of the undertakings’ activity is, a priori, not selective.\n\n83\n\n\nIt is apparent from reading all the grounds of that judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer  Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that, in paragraph 36, read in the light of paragraph 35 of that judgment, the Court held that national measures, such as those at issue in that case, were not selective where they applied indiscriminately to all undertakings in the Member State concerned and constituted, for that reason, a general measure within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 56 of the present judgment.\n\n84\n\n\nIt must also be made clear that while the Court, in paragraph 36 of the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), referred to the activity of undertakings benefiting from the national measures, that reference is explained by the wording of the second question submitted by the referring court in the case that gave rise to that judgment.  That is confirmed by the fact that no such reference is made in the subsequent judgments of the Court which restate that principle (see, inter alia, judgments of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 73, and of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 39).\n\n85\n\n\nMoreover, it is true, as stated by the General Court in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Court held, in paragraph 42 of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for application of the measure concerned in that case could benefit from that measure could not, in itself, make it a selective measure. However, it must be noted that, in that same paragraph, the Court expressly stated that the absence of selectivity was due to the finding that persons who were not eligible for the measure concerned were not in a factual and legal situation comparable to that of taxpayers who were eligible, in the light of the objective pursued by the national legislature.\n\n86\n\n\nIt follows that a condition for the application or the receipt of tax aid may be grounds for a finding that that aid is selective, if that condition leads to a distinction being made between undertakings despite the fact that they are, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, in a comparable factual and legal situation, and if, therefore, it represents discrimination against undertakings which are excluded from it.\n\n87\n\n\nFurther, while, as stated by the General Court in the judgments under appeal,  the tax advantage conferred by the measure at issue can be obtained without any minimum investment requirement and without, consequently, the benefit of that measure being reserved to undertakings having sufficient financial resources, those factors do not preclude the possibility of that measure being classified as selective for other reasons, such as the fact that resident undertakings making acquisitions of shareholdings in companies resident for tax purposes in Spain could not obtain that advantage.\n\n88\n\n\nIn that regard, it may be added that the Court has previously ruled that a tax measure from which solely undertakings that carried out specified transactions benefited, and not undertakings in the same sector that did not carry out those transactions, could be classified as selective, there being no need to assess whether that measure was of greater benefit to large undertakings (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774, paragraphs 47 to 50).\n\n89\n\n\nContrary to the General Court’s assertion in paragraphs 59 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 63 to 66 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, no indication to the contrary as regards the analysis of the condition relating to the selectivity of a tax measure may be deduced from the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467).\n\n90\n\n\nIt follows from paragraphs 22 and 23 of the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), that, in the case that gave rise to that judgment, the Commission had classified the measure concerned as selective in relation to certain geographically defined undertakings in which private investors had reinvested the profits derived from sales of financial assets and not in relation to those investors themselves, with respect to whom the Commission had considered that that measure did not constitute aid, since, as a general measure, it benefited all operators indiscriminately, an assessment that was, moreover, not challenged before the Court and on which the Court therefore did not have to give a ruling.\n\n91\n\n\nIn any event, the situation of those private investors cannot be treated as equivalent to that of the resident undertakings that can benefit from the measure at issue.\n\n92\n\n\nIn the contested decisions,  the Commission, in order to classify the measure at issue as a selective measure, relied on the fact that the tax advantage conferred by that measure did not indiscriminately benefit all economic operators who were objectively in a comparable situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary Spanish tax system, since resident undertakings acquiring shareholdings of the same kind in companies resident for tax purposes in Spain could not obtain that advantage. The Commission then considered that the justification of that distinction between operators, relied on by the Kingdom of Spain, based on the nature or general structure of the system of which that measure formed part, could not be accepted.\n93\n\n\nIt follows from all the foregoing that the General Court erred in law, in annulling the contested decisions, in part, on the ground that the Commission had failed to define a particular category of undertakings favoured by the tax measure at issue, while omitting to determine whether the Commission, in applying the method of examination, described in paragraphs 29 to 33 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 33 to 37 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, which must be used in order to examine the condition relating to the selectivity of the measure at issue, had in fact analysed the question and had established that that measure was discriminatory.\n\n94\n\n\nWhile, indeed, that examination must be carried out rigorously and while sufficient reasons must be stated to permit full judicial review, in particular of the question whether the situation of operators benefiting from the measure is comparable with that of operators excluded from it and, where appropriate, of the justification for discrimination relied on by the Member State concerned, the fact remains that the General Court erred in law by not undertaking such a review, and by ruling, in the judgments under appeal, that the examination method applied by the Commission in the contested decisions, in failing to define a particular category of undertakings which were exclusively favoured by the tax measure at issue, was based on a misinterpretation of the condition relating to selectivity as laid down by Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n95\n\n\nConsequently, the first part of the Commission’s single ground of appeal is well founded.\n\nThe second part of the single ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n96\n\n\nBy the second part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law in applying the case-law relating to aid for exports and introduced an artificial distinction between aid for exports of goods and aid for exports of capital.\n\n97\n\n\nAs regards, first, the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law, in holding in paragraphs 69 to 76 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 73 to 80 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that that case-law concerns not the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure, but only the condition relating to the effect on competition and trade.\n\n98\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, it is apparent from the judgments cited in the preceding paragraph that the Court considered that the tax measures concerned were selective, on the ground that the benefit of them was reserved to undertakings that carried out transactions abroad, such as investments, and not to undertakings carrying out similar transactions domestically. The Commission maintains that it follows that any measure that is to the benefit of cross-border transactions, but excludes the same domestic transactions, is selective.\n\n99\n\n\nSecond, the Commission claims that General Court was wrong to introduce, in paragraphs 79 to 81 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 83 to 85 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, an artificial distinction between aid for exports and aid for export of capital in holding that it followed from the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), that ‘the category of recipient undertakings allowing a finding that the measure at issue was selective was made up of [exporting] undertakings’, a category bringing together undertakings which could be distinguished by reason of their common characteristics linked to their export activity.\n\n100\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, the undertakings affected by the measure at issue constitute a distinct category of undertakings, namely that of undertakings that export capital, since they share specific common characteristics linked to their activity of exporting capital.\n\n101\n\n\nThe Commission considers that, since, with respect to the condition relating to selectivity, there is no difference between the export of goods and the export of capital, the measure at issue was selective to the same degree as the measures concerned in the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions.\n\n102\n\n\nThe Commission maintains that a category of exporting undertakings does not exist, as something separate from the group of undertakings that carry out cross-border transactions. Any undertaking within a Member State can carry out a cross-border transaction and, thereby, qualify for an export aid scheme. The Commission considers that a national measure may become selective because of the advantage granted to the beneficiary of the measure, as a result of carrying out an export transaction, of goods, services or capital, and not by reason of the fact that the undertakings concerned are members of an alleged export sector.\n\n103\n\n\nAccordingly, as the Court ruled in the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), in a situation comparable to that in this case, the General Court ought to have held that the Commission had properly established the selectivity of the measure at issue by reason of the fact that the benefit of that measure was reserved to certain undertakings, namely those which were engaged in the activity of exporting capital.\n\n104\n\n\nLast, the approach adopted the General Court ignores the role and purpose of the body of State aid rules in relation to the protection of the internal market. That body of rules is intended in particular to ensure that Member States do not grant economic advantages specifically linked to the export of goods or capital. The act of specifically favouring exports of capital could give rise to distortions in the internal market in the same way as the act of specifically favouring exports of goods. \n\n105\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa contend that the General Court was correct to hold that the judgments of the Court relied on in the contested decisions concerned not the condition relating to selectivity, but the conditions relating to the effect on trade.\n\n106\n\n\nFurther, the General Court was correct to hold that, in the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Court considered that the measures concerned were selective, the principal ground being that the recipient undertakings shared certain characteristics, a factor that allowed the conclusion that those undertakings belonged to a particular sector of the economy, namely the export sector, more specifically the goods exporting sector. The measures at issue in the cases that gave rise those judgments favoured undertakings of which it was a characteristic feature that they exported a more or less significant part of their goods or services.\n\n107\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa argue that the measure at issue cannot, moreover, be considered to be selective on the ground that it applies to the category of undertakings described as ‘exporters of capital’.\n\n108\n\n\nSuch a category does not exist, and the Commission referred to it neither in the contested decisions nor before the General Court. That argument is inadmissible in an appeal, since it concerns a question of fact that is moreover raised out of time. It may be added that the argument contradicts the Commission’s main line of argument, that the Commission was not obliged to identify a category of undertakings that were affected by a measure in order to establish the selectivity of that measure.\n\n109\n\n\nIn any event, WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa contend that the selectivity of a national measure cannot be ascertained on the basis of characteristics such as the capital of an undertaking or its capacity to invest, since such characteristics are inherent in any undertaking.\n\n110\n\n\nIn addition, the rules governing the free movement of capital do not preclude a measure such as the measure at issue. While that measure involved different treatment that favours acquisitions of shareholdings abroad, that is at most reverse discrimination which is compatible with the fundamental freedoms.\n\n111\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain restates its position, previously argued in the administrative procedure before the Commission, that there is no economic activity that consists of exporting capital. The measure at issue does not favour certain undertakings or the production of certain goods since it is not concerned with the supply of goods and services on the market.\n\n112\n\n\nIreland maintains that the judgments relied on by the Commission in the contested decisions concerned measures which favoured a readily identifiable category of undertakings or the production of a readily identifiable category of goods, namely those involved in the export sector. However, there is no coherent category of undertakings that ‘export capital’, since any undertaking that makes an acquisition abroad ‘exports capital’.\n\n113\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany argues that the Commission’s submission in the alternative that the measure at issue is comparable to a measure granting aid for the export of goods and is therefore also aimed at the sufficiently delimited category of exporting undertakings has to be regarded as a retrospective addition of grounds to the contested decisions. The Federal Republic of Germany considers that that argument must be declared to be inadmissible on appeal.\n\n114\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany contends that the category of exporting undertakings at issue in the case-law relied on by the Commission in the contested decisions is distinct from other undertakings because of common characteristics linked to their exporting activity, which, in some cases, was connected to the making of specific investments.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n115\n\n\nAs regards the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), it is clear that, as stated, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 126 to 130 of his Opinion, the General Court erred in law, in holding, in paragraphs 69 to 76 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 73 to 80 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that that case-law did not concern the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure, but only the condition relating to the question whether competition and trade were affected.\n\n116\n\n\nIn paragraph 20 of the judgment of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), and in paragraph 8 of the judgment of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), the Court, in finding that there was State aid, necessarily held that all the conditions laid down on that subject in Article 107(1) TFEU, including the condition relating to selectivity, were satisfied. Further, in paragraph 120 of the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Court, referring, inter alia, to the two abovementioned judgments, expressly stated its position on the selectivity of the national measure under examination, holding that, in that case, selectivity followed from the fact that only undertakings engaged in export activities and carrying out certain investment transactions abroad qualified for the tax advantage conferred by that measure.\n\n117\n\n\nThe General Court also erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 77 to 82 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 81 to 86 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions had to be understood as meaning that the category of recipient undertakings with respect to whom the selectivity of export aid schemes must be examined was that constituted by ‘export undertakings’, which had to be defined as a category, which, while admittedly extremely broad, is nevertheless defined, comprising undertakings that could be distinguished by reason of specific, shared characteristics linked to their exporting activity.\n\n118\n\n\nAs observed, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 133 to 136 of his Opinion, that case-law cannot be understood as meaning that a national measure must necessarily be classified as selective where that measure benefits exclusively undertakings that export goods or services, even if, in fact, that may have been the case with respect to the particular tax measures at issue in the judgments concerned.\n\n119\n\n\nOn the contrary, taking into consideration the principles enshrined in the Court’s settled case-law, as set out above in paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment, which are entirely applicable to tax aid for exports, a measure such as the measure at issue, designed to facilitate exports, may be regarded as selective if it benefits undertakings carrying out cross-border transactions, in particular investment transactions, and is to the disadvantage of other undertakings which, while in a comparable factual and legal situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, carry out other transactions of the same kind within the national territory.\n\n120\n\n\nThat being the case, the second part of the single ground of appeal is also well founded.\n\n121\n\n\nConsequently, since both parts of the Commission’s single ground of appeal are well founded, the judgments under appeal must be set aside.\n\nThe actions before the General Court\n\n122\n\n\nIn accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, if the Court quashes the decision of the General Court, it may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n123\n\n\nThat is not the case here, since the General Court upheld the two actions for annulment but did not examine three of the four pleas in law relied on in each of those actions, pleas which only partly overlap, and did not examine, within its examination of the first pleas in law in those actions, whether those undertakings that did not meet the conditions for obtaining the tax advantage conferred by the measure at issue were, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, in a factual and legal situation comparable to that of the undertakings favoured by that measure. Further, examination of those pleas may involve assessment of matters of fact. The cases must therefore be referred back to the General Court.\n\nCosts\n\n124\n\n\nSince the cases are being referred back to the General Court, it is appropriate to reserve the costs.\n\n125\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain, as interveners, must bear their own costs.\n\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgments of the General Court of the European Union of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939), and of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938);\n\n\n2.\n\n\nRefers the cases back to the General Court of the European Union;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nReserves the costs;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain to bear their own costs\n"}

The measure at issue states that, to be classified as a ‘foreign company’, a company must be liable to pay a tax that is identical to the tax applicable in Spain and its income must derive mainly from business activities carried out abroad.\n\n6\n\n\nIn paragraphs 10 to 13 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission, which are identical to paragraphs 15 to 18 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court added the following:\n\n‘10\n\n\nIt follows from the [first] contested decision that, under Spanish law, a business combination is an operation whereby one or more companies, on being dissolved without going into liquidation, transfer all their assets and liabilities to another existing company or to a company that they form in exchange for the issue to their shareholders of securities representing the capital of that other company (recital 23 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 32 of the second contested decision]).\n\n11\n\n\nIn the [first] contested decision, share acquisition is to mean an operation whereby one company acquires a shareholding in the capital of another company without obtaining a majority or the control of the voting rights of the target company (recital 23 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 32 of the second contested decision]).\n\n12\n\n\nFurthermore, it is stated in the [first] contested decision that, according to the measure at issue, the financial goodwill is determined by deducting the market value of the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired company from the acquisition price paid for the shareholding. It is also stated that the concept of financial goodwill, as referred to in the measure at issue, introduces into the field of share acquisitions a concept that is usually used in transfers of assets or business combination transactions (recital 20 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 29 of the second contested decision]).\n\n13\n\n\nFinally, it should be noted that under Spanish tax law, the acquisition by an undertaking which is taxable in Spain of a shareholding in a company established in Spain does not allow the goodwill resulting from that acquisition to be recorded separately for tax purposes. However, again according to Spanish tax law, goodwill can be amortised [only in the case of] a business combination (recital 19 of the [first] contested decision[, identical to recital 28 of the second contested decision]).’\n\n7\n\n\nBy the first contested decision, the Commission concluded the procedure with respect to shareholding acquisitions within the European Union.\n\n8\n\n\nIn Article 1(1) of that decision, the Commission declared incompatible with the common market the scheme introduced by the measure at issue (‘the scheme at issue’), whereby a tax advantage was granted to undertakings taxable in Spain in order to enable them to amortise the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shareholdings in foreign undertakings, where it was applied to acquisitions of shareholdings in undertakings established within the European Union. In Article 4 of that decision, the Commission ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid granted under that scheme.\n\n9\n\n\nThe Commission maintained open, however, the procedure as regards acquisitions of shareholdings outside the European Union, the Spanish authorities having given an undertaking that they would provide further details concerning the obstacles to cross-border mergers outside the European Union.\n\n10\n\n\nBy the second contested decision, the Commission declared incompatible with the common market the scheme at issue, whereby a tax advantage was granted to undertakings taxable in Spain in order to enable them to amortise the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shareholdings in foreign undertakings, where it applied to acquisitions of shareholdings in undertakings established outside the European Union (Article 1(1) of that decision), and ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid granted under that scheme (Article 4 of that decision).\n\nThe procedure before the General Court and the judgments under appeal\n\n11\n\n\n By an application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 May 2010, Autogrill España SA, now World Duty Free Group SA (‘WDFG’), brought an action seeking the annulment of Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the first contested decision. \n\n12\n\n\nIn support of its action in so far as it is directed against Article 1(1) of that decision, WDFG relied on four pleas in law: (i) an error of law in the Commission’s application of the condition relating to selectivity; (ii) the measure at issue is not selective in so far as the differentiation that it introduces flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which it is part; (iii) the measure provides no advantage to companies to which the scheme at issue applies; and (iv) with respect to both the criterion relating to selectivity and that relating to the existence of an advantage, a failure to state adequate reasons for that decision.\n\n13\n\n\nBy an application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 29 July 2011,  Banco Santander SA and Santusa Holding SL (‘Santusa’) brought an action seeking the annulment of Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the second contested decision. \n\n14\n\n\nIn support of their action in so far as directed against Article 1(1) of that decision, Banco Santander and Santusa relied on five pleas in law: (i) an error of law in the Commission’s application of the condition relating to selectivity; (ii) an error in identifying the reference system; (iii) the measure at issue is not selective in so far as the differentiation that it introduces is a result of the nature or general structure of the system of which it is part; (iv) the measure provides no advantage to the companies to which the scheme at issue applies; and (v) with respect to both the criterion relating to selectivity and that relating to the existence of an advantage, a failure to state adequate reasons for the contested decision.\n\n15\n\n\nIn the judgments under appeal, the General Court, on essentially identical grounds, upheld the first plea of law in each of the two actions, namely that Article 107(1) TFEU had been misapplied with respect to the condition relating to selectivity, and consequently annulled Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the contested decisions, without examining the other pleas raised in those actions. \n\nForm of order sought by the parties and procedures before the Court\n\n16\n\n\nThe Commission claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgments under appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nrefer the respective cases back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\nreserve the costs. \n\n17\n\n\nWDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P, contend that the Court should dismiss the appeals, uphold the judgments under appeal and order the Commission to pay the costs.\n\n18\n\n\nBy decisions of the President of the Court of 19 May 2015, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain were granted leave to intervene in support of the forms of order sought by WDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and by Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P.\n\n19\n\n\nOn the other hand, by orders of the President of the Court of 6 October 2015, the applications of Telefónica SA and Iberdrola SA for leave to intervene in support of the forms of order sought by WDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and by Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P, were refused.\n\nThe appeals\n\n20\n\n\nIn support of its appeals, the Commission relies on a single ground of appeal, which has two parts, consisting of the claim that the General Court erred in law in the interpretation of the condition relating to selectivity as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU. \n\nThe first part of the single ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n21\n\n\nBy the first part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law by holding that the Commission was obliged, in order to demonstrate that a measure is selective, to identify a group of undertakings with specific characteristics.\n\n22\n\n\nThe Commission maintains that, in the contested decisions, it rigorously followed the method for the analysis of selectivity in tax matters, as that method is set out in the Court’s settled case-law. The Commission accordingly established that the measure at issue constituted a derogation from a reference system, in that the effect of the measure was that the tax treatment of undertakings taxable in Spain acquiring shareholdings of at least 5% in companies established outside Spain differed from that applicable to undertakings taxable in Spain making identical acquisitions in companies established in Spain, although those two categories of undertakings were in comparable situations in the light of the objective pursued by the general Spanish system for the taxation of companies.\n\n23\n\n\nThe Commission considers that the General Court, by imposing on it the additional obligation of demonstrating that the measure at issue favours certain undertakings capable of identification by reason of characteristics specific to them that other undertakings do not possess, in other words ex ante identifiable features that are characteristic of them, erred in law, since, in so doing, the General Court attributed a meaning to the condition relating to selectivity that is more restrictive than that defined by the Court.\n\n24\n\n\nThe Commission maintains, in particular, that, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraphs 57 and 58 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 61 and 62 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, measures can be classified as selective even if those measures are to be applied regardless of the nature of the activities of the beneficiary and create a tax advantage for certain investment transactions without setting a minimum investment amount.\n\n25\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, in that context, the General Court erred in inferring from the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that a national measure which is to be applied regardless of the nature of the activity of undertakings is not, a priori, selective. The statement in paragraph 36 of that judgment, that ‘national measures such as those at issue in the main proceedings do not constitute State aid … if they apply to all undertakings in national territory, regardless of their activity’ should be understood to mean that the reason why there is no selectivity is that the national measure applies indiscriminately to all undertakings in the Member State concerned.\n\n26\n\n\nThe Commission also claims that the General Court erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 59 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 63 to 66 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that a measure such as the measure at issue is not selective where it is linked to the purchase of particular financial assets, namely shareholdings in foreign companies, and where no category of undertakings is, a priori, excluded from benefiting from it.\n\n27\n\n\nThe Commission submits that the General Court wrongly relied in this regard on the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467). It follows from paragraphs 22 and 23 of that judgment that, in the case which gave rise to it, the Commission had classified the measure concerned as selective only in relation to certain geographically defined undertakings in which private investors had reinvested the profits from the sale of economic assets and not in relation to those investors themselves, for whom it had held that that measure did not constitute aid.\n\n28\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission criticises the General Court for having held, in paragraphs 66 to 68 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 70 to 72 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that it would be contrary to the case-law of the Court of Justice to regard as selective a national tax measure the benefit of which is subject to certain conditions, even though the beneficiary undertakings do not share any feature characteristic of them that distinguishes them from other undertakings, apart from the fact that they are capable of satisfying the conditions governing the application of the measure.\n\n29\n\n\nThe Commission submits that the General Court relies in that regard on an erroneous analysis of the case-law concerned.\n\n30\n\n\nWith respect to the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), the Commission argues that it is clear from paragraphs 90 and 91 of that judgment that that case concerned a particular situation in which the Court considered the reference tax system itself to be selective, in that it favoured ‘offshore’ undertakings as such, rather than any derogation from it. The reference made in that judgment to the ‘specific properties’ of a category of undertakings should therefore be understood as referring to the characteristics by reason of which those undertakings were favoured for tax purposes under a reference system that was inherently selective and cannot be extrapolated beyond that particular context.\n\n31\n\n\nAs regards paragraph 42 of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), the General Court failed to take into account the second sentence of that paragraph, which sets out the principle, enshrined in the Court’s settled case-law, that a measure is selective if it is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings, who are, in the light of the objective pursued by the scheme, in a comparable factual and legal situation.\n\n32\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa submit, first, that the Commission did not maintain, in the contested decisions, that the measure at issue was de facto selective, and, consequently, the present appeals are concerned only with examining the criticisms directed against the judgments under appeal to the effect that the General Court held that the grounds relied on by the Commission in those decisions did not support the conclusion that that measure was de jure selective.\n\n33\n\n\nThey contend that it follows from the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that a measure from which all undertakings can benefit cannot be considered to be selective. That judgment does not however permit the inference, as claimed by the Commission, that a national measure is not selective where it applies to all the undertakings in a Member State without exception, since, if that argument were valid, almost all tax rules would have to be considered to be selective.\n\n34\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa also dispute the Commission’s argument that national tax measures have on many occasions previously been classified as selective even though they set no minimum investment amount and applied regardless of the nature of the beneficiary’s activities. In any event, the measure at issue, in that it confers a tax advantage on any undertaking that wishes to benefit from it, irrespective of which category it falls into, for that reason alone cannot be deemed to be prima facie and de jure selective.\n\n35\n\n\nThe General Court was correct to rely on the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), since, in the decision that was at issue in that judgment, the Commission had expressly accepted that the national measure was not selective as regards the investors concerned, a position confirmed by the Court.\n\n36\n\n\nIn its decision-making practice, moreover, the Commission has on many occasions previously found tax measures not to be selective on the basis of the same criterion, in other words that general measures which are applicable to all undertakings without distinction and of which all taxable persons may take advantage are not selective.\n\n37\n\n\nWhat is more, the application of that criterion would not lead to a finding that measures relating to the purchase of certain assets as referred to by the Commission were not selective. Such measures could be classified as selective if it were shown that they do in fact benefit certain undertakings to the exclusion of others. In any event, their selectivity would follow not from the nature of the assets acquired but from the fact that it is legitimate to hold that the purchasers concerned form a particular category.\n\n38\n\n\nWith regard to the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa take the view that the General Court was right to consider that the measure at issue in the case which gave rise to that judgment differs from that in the present case, since it was intended to confer an advantage on a distinct and identifiable category of undertakings, that is to say those engaged in exporting.\n\n39\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa further submit that it follows clearly from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), and in particular paragraph 104 thereof, that a measure can be classified as selective only if it benefits a category of undertakings sharing ‘properties’ which are ‘specific’ to them. It follows moreover from that judgment that the identification of a derogation from an ordinary system is not an end in itself. All that matters is the actual effect of the measure, namely the fact that it does or does not benefit specific undertakings or the production of specific goods.\n\n40\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa argue that the interpretation of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), advocated by the Commission, can again not be accepted. First, in that judgment, the Court did not uphold the definition of a reference system and a derogation from that system. Second, that judgment does not permit a conclusion that a measure is selective by reason of the fact that the undertakings which satisfy the conditions to benefit from that measure form a distinct category.\n\n41\n\n\nLast, the General Court was correct to hold that a measure cannot be classified as selective, within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU, if the benefit of that measure depends on conduct that is prima facie open to any undertaking, irrespective of an undertaking’s sector of activity. That follows from the finding, in the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), that a national measure was not selective as regards investors.\n\n42\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain submits that the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598) confirms the position taken by the Spanish authorities during the administrative procedure before the Commission, to the effect that an economic advantage can be classified as aid only if it is capable of favouring ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n43\n\n\nIn the course of that administrative procedure, the Spanish authorities demonstrated that the measure at issue was generally accessible, on the ground that it was applied to undertakings active in very different business sectors, thereby supporting the analysis set out in the judgments under appeal and the fact that the Commission had failed in the contested decisions to demonstrate that that measure was selective.\n\n44\n\n\nIreland submits that, contrary to what is argued by the Commission, the General Court did not infer from the judgment of the Court of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), and the judgments of the General Court of 6 March 2002, Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission (T‑92/00 and T‑103/00, EU:T:2002:61), and of 9 September 2009, Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission (T‑227/01 to T‑229/01, T‑265/01, T‑266/01 and T‑270/01, EU:T:2009:315), that only measures the application of which was linked to the nature of the undertaking’s activities or the application of which was dependent on a minimum amount were selective, but held that selectivity could not be established with respect to a measure from which all undertakings resident for tax purposes in Spain and making acquisitions of at least 5% shareholdings in foreign undertakings could benefit, regardless of the nature of their activities and the amounts invested.\n\n45\n\n\nThe General Court was correct to rely on the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), in order to hold that it was necessary, if different tax treatment was to be classified as aid, that a particular category of undertakings capable of benefiting should be identified, by reason of their specific properties. The condition relating to selectivity as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU should moreover be defined in the same way in all cases concerning alleged State aid of a fiscal nature. Accordingly, the principle expressly stated in paragraph 104 of that judgment cannot be limited to a situation in which a tax system taken as a whole is selective.\n\n46\n\n\nIreland considers that measures such as the measure at issue, which do not a priori exclude any undertaking or any particular economic sector from the ambit of its recipients, cannot be regarded as being selective. The Commission has on several occasions previously relied on that ground in order to determine that certain national measures are not selective.\n\n47\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany submits that the existence, even if it were established, of a derogation from or exception to the reference framework identified by the Commission is not, in itself, sufficient to conclude that the measure at issue favours ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n48\n\n\nOn the contrary, it follows only that that measure is similar to a subsidy. Consequently, after an examination designed to determine that the measure has the nature of a derogation, it is appropriate, in accordance with the case-law and, in particular, the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), and as the General Court correctly held in the judgments under appeal, thereafter to determine whether the category of taxpayers favoured by a tax measure involves sufficiently specific undertakings or the production of sufficiently specific goods within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows accordingly from the Court’s case-law that the category of undertakings which receive a tax advantage is sufficiently specified where the Commission has been able to demonstrate that the advantage concerned was for the benefit of only undertakings belonging to a single economic sector and carrying out particular transactions (judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774), only undertakings that have a particular legal form (judgment of 10 January 2006, Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others, C‑222/04, EU:C:2006:8), only undertakings of a certain size (judgment of 13 February 2003, Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92) or only undertakings resident for tax purposes outside the territory of a region (judgment of 17 November 2009Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri, C‑169/08, EU:C:2009:709).\n\n50\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany recalls that the Court has previously held that a tax concession in favour of taxpayers who sell certain financial assets and can offset the resulting profit when they acquire other financial assets confers on them an advantage which, as a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators, cannot be classified as State aid (judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission, C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467, paragraph 22).\n\n51\n\n\nA fortiori, therefore, a tax measure such as that at issue, the application of which is generally linked to a certain category of transactions falling within the scope of company law, in this instance the acquisition of shareholdings, regardless of the object and business activities of the undertaking, should not be considered to be selective.\n\n52\n\n\nLast, the Member States intervening in these cases submit that, if the selectivity of a national measure as a condition for its classification as State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, were to be understood in the broad sense advocated by the Commission in its appeals, the consequence would be an undermining of the division of powers within the European Union. If such scope were to be conferred on the selectivity condition, the Commission could review almost all direct tax measures by virtue of its powers in the field of State aid, although direct taxation falls, as a general rule, within the legislative competence of the Member States.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n53\n\n\n First, it must be recalled that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, classification of a national measure as ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, requires all the following conditions to be fulfilled. First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources. Second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between the Member States. Third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient. Fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, inter alia, judgment of 16 July 2015, BVVG, C‑39/14, EU:C:2015:470, paragraph 24).\n\n54\n\n\nSo far as concerns the condition relating to the selectivity of the advantage, which is a constituent factor in the concept of ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, it is clear from equally settled case-law of the Court that  the assessment of that condition requires a determination whether, under a particular legal regime, a national measure is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation and who accordingly suffer different treatment that can, in essence, be classified as discriminatory  (see, inter alia, judgments of 28 July 2011, Mediaset v Commission, C‑403/10 P, not published, EU:C:2011:533, paragraph 36; of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 75 and 101; and of 14 January 2015, Eventech, C‑518/13, EU:C:2015:9, paragraphs 53 to 55; and of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C‑15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 59).\n\n55\n\n\nFurther, where the measure at issue is conceived as an aid scheme and not as individual aid, it is for the Commission to establish that that measure, although it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or certain sectors of activity (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraphs 49 and 50).\n\n56\n\n\nAs regards, in particular,  national measures that confer a tax advantage, it must be recalled that a measure of that nature which, although not involving the transfer of State resources, places the recipients in a more favourable position than other taxpayers is capable of procuring a selective advantage for the recipients and, consequently, of constituting State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.On the other hand, a tax advantage resulting from a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators does not constitute such aid  (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 18 July 2013, P,C‑6/12, EU:C:2013:525, paragraph 18).\n\n57\n\n\nIn that context, in order to classify a national tax measure as ‘selective’, the Commission must begin by identifying the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, and thereafter demonstrate that the tax measure at issue is a derogation from that ordinary system, in so far as it differentiates between operators who, in the light of the objective pursued by that ordinary tax system, are in a comparable factual and legal situation (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraph 49).\n\n58\n\n\nThe concept of ‘State aid’ does not, however, cover measures that differentiate between undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by the legal regime concerned, are in a comparable factual and legal situation, and are, therefore, a priori selective, where the Member State concerned is able to demonstrate that that differentiation is justified since it flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which the measures form part (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgments of 29 April 2004, Netherlands v Commission, C‑159/01, EU:C:2004:246, paragraphs 42 and 43; of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraphs 64 and 65; and of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 40).\n\n59\n\n\nFurther, it must be recalled that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for the application of a measure can benefit from the measure cannot, in itself, make it into a selective measure (judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 42).\n\n60\n\n\nIt follows from all the foregoing that  the appropriate criterion for establishing the selectivity of the measure at issue consists in determining whether that measure introduces, between operators that are, in the light of the objective pursued by the general tax system concerned, in a comparable factual and legal situation, a distinction that is not justified by the nature and general structure of that system  (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C‑15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 61).\n61\n\n\nThose are the factors that must guide the Court’s examination of whether, in this case, the General Court misconstrued Article 107(1) TFEU, as interpreted by the Court, by holding that the Commission had not, in the contested decisions, demonstrated to the requisite legal standard that the measure at issue conferred a selective advantage on ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’.\n\n62\n\n\nIn this case, the measure at issue confers a tax advantage that consists in a deduction from the taxable base for corporation tax in the form of an amortisation of the goodwill resulting from the acquisition by undertakings resident for tax purposes in Spain of at least 5% shareholdings in undertakings resident for tax purposes outside that Member State. That measure must, since it is capable of conferring an advantage on all such undertakings which carry out such transactions, be regarded as capable of constituting an aid scheme. It was therefore for the Commission to establish that that measure, notwithstanding that it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or on certain sectors of activity.\n\n63\n\n\nIn that regard, the General Court stated, in paragraph 50 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 54 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Commission, in order to establish that the measure at issue was selective, had primarily relied, in the contested decisions, on the ground that that measure constitutes a derogation from a reference system, in that the effect of that measure was the application to undertakings taxable in Spain, acquiring shareholdings in companies established outside Spain, of a tax treatment that differed from that applied to undertakings taxable in Spain making such acquisitions in companies established in Spain, although those two categories of undertakings were in comparable situations in the light of the objective pursued by that reference system, namely the general Spanish system for the taxation of companies and, more specifically, the rules relating to the tax treatment of financial goodwill within that tax system.\n\n64\n\n\nThe General Court held, in paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Commission had thereby applied the analytical method that may be deduced from the case-law of the Court and of the General Court cited, respectively, in paragraphs 29 to 33 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 33 to 37 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, which essentially corresponds to the Court’s case-law cited in paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment.\n\n65\n\n\nHowever, in paragraphs 44, 45, 52 and 53 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 48, 49, 56 and 57 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court held that the existence, were it to be established, of a derogation or an exception to the reference system identified by the Commission was not sufficient, in itself, to establish that the measure at issue favoured ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, since that measure was accessible, a priori, to any undertaking and it was directed not to a particular category of undertakings, which would have been the only undertakings favoured by that measure, but to a category of economic transactions.\n\n66\n\n\nIt is, however, clear that that reasoning is based on a misapplication of the selectivity condition laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU, as described in this judgment.\n\n67\n\n\nAs is apparent from paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment,  with respect to a national measure conferring a tax advantage of general application, such as the measure at issue, that condition is satisfied where the Commission is able to demonstrate that that measure is a derogation from the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, thereby introducing, through its actual effects, differences in the treatment of operators, although the operators who qualify for the tax advantage and those who do not are, in the light of the objective pursued by that Member State’s tax system, in a comparable factual and legal situation.\n\n68\n\n\nIt is apparent from the judgments under appeal that the Commission relied, in the contested decisions, in order to establish that the measure at issue was selective, on the fact that the consequence of that measure was that resident undertakings were not treated equally. Pursuant to that measure, only resident undertakings who acquired at least 5% shareholdings in foreign companies could, under certain conditions, qualify for the tax advantage at issue, whereas resident undertakings making the acquisition of such a shareholding in undertakings taxable in Spain could not obtain that advantage, notwithstanding the fact that, according to the Commission, they were in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary Spanish tax system.\n\n69\n\n\nHowever, the General Court considered that the measure at issue, on the grounds that it did not affect any particular category of undertakings or the production of any particular category of goods, that it was applicable regardless of the nature of an undertaking’s activity and that it was accessible, a priori or potentially, to all undertakings that wanted to acquire shareholdings of at least 5% in foreign companies and that held those shareholdings without interruption for at least one year, had to be regarded not as a selective measure but as a general measure within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 56 of this judgment. In so doing, the General Court erred in law.\n\n70\n\n\nThus, in paragraphs 41, 45, 67 and 68 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 45, 49, 71 and 72 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court held that, if the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure relevant to the recognition of State aid, in respect of a measure that is a priori accessible to any undertaking, is to be satisfied, it is always necessary that a particular category of undertakings, who are exclusively favoured by the measure concerned and who can be distinguished by reason of specific properties, common to them and characteristic of them, be identified.\n\n71\n\n\nHowever, the imposition of such a supplementary requirement to identify a particular category of undertakings, additional to the analytical method applicable to selectivity in tax matters that may be deduced from the Court’s settled case-law, which essentially involves ascertaining whether the exclusion of certain operators from the benefit of a tax advantage that arises from a measure derogating from an ordinary tax system constitutes discrimination with respect to those operators, cannot be inferred from the Court’s case-law and, in particular, from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732).\n\n72\n\n\nIt is true that, in paragraph 104 of that judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), the Court held that, in order to be capable of being recognised as conferring selective advantages, the criteria forming the basis of assessment which are adopted by a tax system must be such as to characterise the recipient undertakings, by virtue of properties which are specific to them, as a privileged category, thus permitting such a regime to be described as favouring ‘certain’ undertakings or the production of ‘certain’ goods, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n73\n\n\nHowever, that ground of the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), must be read in the context of the set of grounds of which it forms part, set out in paragraphs 87 to 108 of that judgment.\n\n74\n\n\nIt follows from a reading of all those grounds that the measure at issue in that judgment did not take the form of a tax advantage that derogated from an ordinary tax system, but rather involved the application of a ‘general’ tax scheme based on criteria that were, in themselves, also general. The Court held that the nature of that scheme did not preclude a finding that the measure concerned was selective, contrary to the ruling of the General Court, since the condition relating to selectivity has a broader scope that extends to measures which, by their effects, favour certain undertakings, in that case ‘offshore’ companies, on account of the specific features characteristic of those undertakings. That measure accordingly operated de facto discrimination against undertakings that were in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, in that case the objective of putting in place generalised taxation of all resident companies.\n\n75\n\n\nBy contrast, as stated above in paragraph 63 of this judgment, in the contested decisions, the Commission, in order to establish the selectivity of the measure at issue, relied primarily on the ground that the consequence of that measure is discrimination, in that it confers a tax advantage on certain resident undertakings and not on others who are subject to the same ordinary tax system from which the measure at issue is a derogation.\n\n76\n\n\nWhile it therefore follows from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), that the selectivity of a tax measure can be established even if that measure does not constitute a derogation from an ordinary tax system, but is an integral part of that system, the fact remains that that judgment is consistent with the Court’s settled case-law, cited in paragraph 57 of this judgment, to the effect that it is sufficient, in order to establish the selectivity of a measure that derogates from an ordinary tax system, to demonstrate that that measure benefits certain operators and not others, although all those operators are in an objectively comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary tax system.\n\n77\n\n\nIndeed, while it is not always necessary that a tax measure, in order for it to be established that it is selective, should derogate from an ordinary tax system, the fact that it can be so characterised is highly relevant in that regard where the effect of that measure is that two categories of operators are distinguished and are subject, a priori, to different treatment, namely those who fall within the scope of the derogating measure and those who continue to fall within the scope of the ordinary tax system, although those two categories are in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by that system.\n78\n\n\nContrary to what was held by the General Court in the judgments under appeal,  neither can it be required of the Commission, in order to establish the selectivity of such a measure, that it should identify certain specific features that are characteristic of and common to the undertakings that are the recipients of the tax advantage, by which they can be distinguished from those undertakings that are excluded from the advantage.\n\n79\n\n\nAll that matters in that regard is the fact that the measure, irrespective of its form or the legislative means used, should have the effect of placing the recipient undertakings in a position that is more favourable than that of other undertakings, although all those undertakings are in a comparable factual and legal situation in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned.\n80\n\n\nFurther, according to the Court’s settled case-law, the fact that the number of undertakings able to claim entitlement under a national measure is very large, or that those undertakings belong to various economic sectors, is not sufficient to call into question the selective nature of that measure and, therefore, to rule out its classification as State aid (see, inter alia, judgments of 13 February 2003, Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92, paragraph 48, and of 8 September 2011, Commission v Netherlands, C‑279/08 P, EU:C:2011:551, paragraph 50).\n\n81\n\n\nAccordingly, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraphs 53 to 58 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 57 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the potentially selective nature of the measure at issue is in no way called into question by the fact that the essential condition for obtaining the tax advantage conferred by that measure is that there should be an economic transaction, more particularly an ‘entirely financial’ transaction, for which no minimum investment is required and which is available regardless of the nature of the business of the recipient undertakings.\n\n82\n\n\nIn that context, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraph 57 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 61 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, it cannot be inferred from paragraph 36 of the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), according to which measures are not selective where they apply to all the undertakings in the national territory, ‘regardless of their activity’, that a measure whose application does not depend on the nature of the undertakings’ activity is, a priori, not selective.\n\n83\n\n\nIt is apparent from reading all the grounds of that judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer  Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that, in paragraph 36, read in the light of paragraph 35 of that judgment, the Court held that national measures, such as those at issue in that case, were not selective where they applied indiscriminately to all undertakings in the Member State concerned and constituted, for that reason, a general measure within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 56 of the present judgment.\n\n84\n\n\nIt must also be made clear that while the Court, in paragraph 36 of the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), referred to the activity of undertakings benefiting from the national measures, that reference is explained by the wording of the second question submitted by the referring court in the case that gave rise to that judgment.  That is confirmed by the fact that no such reference is made in the subsequent judgments of the Court which restate that principle (see, inter alia, judgments of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 73, and of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 39).\n\n85\n\n\nMoreover, it is true, as stated by the General Court in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Court held, in paragraph 42 of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for application of the measure concerned in that case could benefit from that measure could not, in itself, make it a selective measure. However, it must be noted that, in that same paragraph, the Court expressly stated that the absence of selectivity was due to the finding that persons who were not eligible for the measure concerned were not in a factual and legal situation comparable to that of taxpayers who were eligible, in the light of the objective pursued by the national legislature.\n\n86\n\n\nIt follows that a condition for the application or the receipt of tax aid may be grounds for a finding that that aid is selective, if that condition leads to a distinction being made between undertakings despite the fact that they are, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, in a comparable factual and legal situation, and if, therefore, it represents discrimination against undertakings which are excluded from it.\n\n87\n\n\nFurther, while, as stated by the General Court in the judgments under appeal,  the tax advantage conferred by the measure at issue can be obtained without any minimum investment requirement and without, consequently, the benefit of that measure being reserved to undertakings having sufficient financial resources, those factors do not preclude the possibility of that measure being classified as selective for other reasons, such as the fact that resident undertakings making acquisitions of shareholdings in companies resident for tax purposes in Spain could not obtain that advantage.\n\n88\n\n\nIn that regard, it may be added that the Court has previously ruled that a tax measure from which solely undertakings that carried out specified transactions benefited, and not undertakings in the same sector that did not carry out those transactions, could be classified as selective, there being no need to assess whether that measure was of greater benefit to large undertakings (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774, paragraphs 47 to 50).\n\n89\n\n\nContrary to the General Court’s assertion in paragraphs 59 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 63 to 66 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, no indication to the contrary as regards the analysis of the condition relating to the selectivity of a tax measure may be deduced from the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467).\n\n90\n\n\nIt follows from paragraphs 22 and 23 of the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), that, in the case that gave rise to that judgment, the Commission had classified the measure concerned as selective in relation to certain geographically defined undertakings in which private investors had reinvested the profits derived from sales of financial assets and not in relation to those investors themselves, with respect to whom the Commission had considered that that measure did not constitute aid, since, as a general measure, it benefited all operators indiscriminately, an assessment that was, moreover, not challenged before the Court and on which the Court therefore did not have to give a ruling.\n\n91\n\n\nIn any event, the situation of those private investors cannot be treated as equivalent to that of the resident undertakings that can benefit from the measure at issue.\n\n92\n\n\nIn the contested decisions,  the Commission, in order to classify the measure at issue as a selective measure, relied on the fact that the tax advantage conferred by that measure did not indiscriminately benefit all economic operators who were objectively in a comparable situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary Spanish tax system, since resident undertakings acquiring shareholdings of the same kind in companies resident for tax purposes in Spain could not obtain that advantage. The Commission then considered that the justification of that distinction between operators, relied on by the Kingdom of Spain, based on the nature or general structure of the system of which that measure formed part, could not be accepted.\n93\n\n\nIt follows from all the foregoing that the General Court erred in law, in annulling the contested decisions, in part, on the ground that the Commission had failed to define a particular category of undertakings favoured by the tax measure at issue, while omitting to determine whether the Commission, in applying the method of examination, described in paragraphs 29 to 33 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 33 to 37 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, which must be used in order to examine the condition relating to the selectivity of the measure at issue, had in fact analysed the question and had established that that measure was discriminatory.\n\n94\n\n\nWhile, indeed, that examination must be carried out rigorously and while sufficient reasons must be stated to permit full judicial review, in particular of the question whether the situation of operators benefiting from the measure is comparable with that of operators excluded from it and, where appropriate, of the justification for discrimination relied on by the Member State concerned, the fact remains that the General Court erred in law by not undertaking such a review, and by ruling, in the judgments under appeal, that the examination method applied by the Commission in the contested decisions, in failing to define a particular category of undertakings which were exclusively favoured by the tax measure at issue, was based on a misinterpretation of the condition relating to selectivity as laid down by Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n95\n\n\nConsequently, the first part of the Commission’s single ground of appeal is well founded.\n\nThe second part of the single ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n96\n\n\nBy the second part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law in applying the case-law relating to aid for exports and introduced an artificial distinction between aid for exports of goods and aid for exports of capital.\n\n97\n\n\nAs regards, first, the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law, in holding in paragraphs 69 to 76 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 73 to 80 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that that case-law concerns not the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure, but only the condition relating to the effect on competition and trade.\n\n98\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, it is apparent from the judgments cited in the preceding paragraph that the Court considered that the tax measures concerned were selective, on the ground that the benefit of them was reserved to undertakings that carried out transactions abroad, such as investments, and not to undertakings carrying out similar transactions domestically. The Commission maintains that it follows that any measure that is to the benefit of cross-border transactions, but excludes the same domestic transactions, is selective.\n\n99\n\n\nSecond, the Commission claims that General Court was wrong to introduce, in paragraphs 79 to 81 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 83 to 85 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, an artificial distinction between aid for exports and aid for export of capital in holding that it followed from the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), that ‘the category of recipient undertakings allowing a finding that the measure at issue was selective was made up of [exporting] undertakings’, a category bringing together undertakings which could be distinguished by reason of their common characteristics linked to their export activity.\n\n100\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, the undertakings affected by the measure at issue constitute a distinct category of undertakings, namely that of undertakings that export capital, since they share specific common characteristics linked to their activity of exporting capital.\n\n101\n\n\nThe Commission considers that, since, with respect to the condition relating to selectivity, there is no difference between the export of goods and the export of capital, the measure at issue was selective to the same degree as the measures concerned in the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions.\n\n102\n\n\nThe Commission maintains that a category of exporting undertakings does not exist, as something separate from the group of undertakings that carry out cross-border transactions. Any undertaking within a Member State can carry out a cross-border transaction and, thereby, qualify for an export aid scheme. The Commission considers that a national measure may become selective because of the advantage granted to the beneficiary of the measure, as a result of carrying out an export transaction, of goods, services or capital, and not by reason of the fact that the undertakings concerned are members of an alleged export sector.\n\n103\n\n\nAccordingly, as the Court ruled in the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), in a situation comparable to that in this case, the General Court ought to have held that the Commission had properly established the selectivity of the measure at issue by reason of the fact that the benefit of that measure was reserved to certain undertakings, namely those which were engaged in the activity of exporting capital.\n\n104\n\n\nLast, the approach adopted the General Court ignores the role and purpose of the body of State aid rules in relation to the protection of the internal market. That body of rules is intended in particular to ensure that Member States do not grant economic advantages specifically linked to the export of goods or capital. The act of specifically favouring exports of capital could give rise to distortions in the internal market in the same way as the act of specifically favouring exports of goods. \n\n105\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa contend that the General Court was correct to hold that the judgments of the Court relied on in the contested decisions concerned not the condition relating to selectivity, but the conditions relating to the effect on trade.\n\n106\n\n\nFurther, the General Court was correct to hold that, in the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Court considered that the measures concerned were selective, the principal ground being that the recipient undertakings shared certain characteristics, a factor that allowed the conclusion that those undertakings belonged to a particular sector of the economy, namely the export sector, more specifically the goods exporting sector. The measures at issue in the cases that gave rise those judgments favoured undertakings of which it was a characteristic feature that they exported a more or less significant part of their goods or services.\n\n107\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa argue that the measure at issue cannot, moreover, be considered to be selective on the ground that it applies to the category of undertakings described as ‘exporters of capital’.\n\n108\n\n\nSuch a category does not exist, and the Commission referred to it neither in the contested decisions nor before the General Court. That argument is inadmissible in an appeal, since it concerns a question of fact that is moreover raised out of time. It may be added that the argument contradicts the Commission’s main line of argument, that the Commission was not obliged to identify a category of undertakings that were affected by a measure in order to establish the selectivity of that measure.\n\n109\n\n\nIn any event, WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa contend that the selectivity of a national measure cannot be ascertained on the basis of characteristics such as the capital of an undertaking or its capacity to invest, since such characteristics are inherent in any undertaking.\n\n110\n\n\nIn addition, the rules governing the free movement of capital do not preclude a measure such as the measure at issue. While that measure involved different treatment that favours acquisitions of shareholdings abroad, that is at most reverse discrimination which is compatible with the fundamental freedoms.\n\n111\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain restates its position, previously argued in the administrative procedure before the Commission, that there is no economic activity that consists of exporting capital. The measure at issue does not favour certain undertakings or the production of certain goods since it is not concerned with the supply of goods and services on the market.\n\n112\n\n\nIreland maintains that the judgments relied on by the Commission in the contested decisions concerned measures which favoured a readily identifiable category of undertakings or the production of a readily identifiable category of goods, namely those involved in the export sector. However, there is no coherent category of undertakings that ‘export capital’, since any undertaking that makes an acquisition abroad ‘exports capital’.\n\n113\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany argues that the Commission’s submission in the alternative that the measure at issue is comparable to a measure granting aid for the export of goods and is therefore also aimed at the sufficiently delimited category of exporting undertakings has to be regarded as a retrospective addition of grounds to the contested decisions. The Federal Republic of Germany considers that that argument must be declared to be inadmissible on appeal.\n\n114\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany contends that the category of exporting undertakings at issue in the case-law relied on by the Commission in the contested decisions is distinct from other undertakings because of common characteristics linked to their exporting activity, which, in some cases, was connected to the making of specific investments.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n115\n\n\nAs regards the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), it is clear that, as stated, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 126 to 130 of his Opinion, the General Court erred in law, in holding, in paragraphs 69 to 76 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 73 to 80 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that that case-law did not concern the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure, but only the condition relating to the question whether competition and trade were affected.\n\n116\n\n\nIn paragraph 20 of the judgment of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), and in paragraph 8 of the judgment of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), the Court, in finding that there was State aid, necessarily held that all the conditions laid down on that subject in Article 107(1) TFEU, including the condition relating to selectivity, were satisfied. Further, in paragraph 120 of the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Court, referring, inter alia, to the two abovementioned judgments, expressly stated its position on the selectivity of the national measure under examination, holding that, in that case, selectivity followed from the fact that only undertakings engaged in export activities and carrying out certain investment transactions abroad qualified for the tax advantage conferred by that measure.\n\n117\n\n\nThe General Court also erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 77 to 82 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 81 to 86 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions had to be understood as meaning that the category of recipient undertakings with respect to whom the selectivity of export aid schemes must be examined was that constituted by ‘export undertakings’, which had to be defined as a category, which, while admittedly extremely broad, is nevertheless defined, comprising undertakings that could be distinguished by reason of specific, shared characteristics linked to their exporting activity.\n\n118\n\n\nAs observed, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 133 to 136 of his Opinion, that case-law cannot be understood as meaning that a national measure must necessarily be classified as selective where that measure benefits exclusively undertakings that export goods or services, even if, in fact, that may have been the case with respect to the particular tax measures at issue in the judgments concerned.\n\n119\n\n\nOn the contrary, taking into consideration the principles enshrined in the Court’s settled case-law, as set out above in paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment, which are entirely applicable to tax aid for exports, a measure such as the measure at issue, designed to facilitate exports, may be regarded as selective if it benefits undertakings carrying out cross-border transactions, in particular investment transactions, and is to the disadvantage of other undertakings which, while in a comparable factual and legal situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, carry out other transactions of the same kind within the national territory.\n\n120\n\n\nThat being the case, the second part of the single ground of appeal is also well founded.\n\n121\n\n\nConsequently, since both parts of the Commission’s single ground of appeal are well founded, the judgments under appeal must be set aside.\n\nThe actions before the General Court\n\n122\n\n\nIn accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, if the Court quashes the decision of the General Court, it may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n123\n\n\nThat is not the case here, since the General Court upheld the two actions for annulment but did not examine three of the four pleas in law relied on in each of those actions, pleas which only partly overlap, and did not examine, within its examination of the first pleas in law in those actions, whether those undertakings that did not meet the conditions for obtaining the tax advantage conferred by the measure at issue were, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, in a factual and legal situation comparable to that of the undertakings favoured by that measure. Further, examination of those pleas may involve assessment of matters of fact. The cases must therefore be referred back to the General Court.\n\nCosts\n\n124\n\n\nSince the cases are being referred back to the General Court, it is appropriate to reserve the costs.\n\n125\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain, as interveners, must bear their own costs.\n\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgments of the General Court of the European Union of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939), and of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938);\n\n\n2.\n\n\nRefers the cases back to the General Court of the European Union;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nReserves the costs;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain to bear their own costs\n"}

Tourrès, Administrator,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure and further to the hearing on 31 May 2016,\n\nafter hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 28 July 2016,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\nBy its appeal in Case C‑20/15 P, the European Commission asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939; ‘the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission’), whereby the General Court annulled Article 1(1) and Article 4 of Commission Decision 2011/5/EC of 28 October 2009 on the tax amortisation of financial goodwill for foreign shareholding acquisitions C 45/07 (ex NN 51/07, ex CP 9/07) implemented by Spain (OJ 2011 L 7, p. 48; ‘the first contested decision’).\n\n2\n\n\nBy its appeal in Case C‑21/15 P, the Commission asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938; ‘the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission’), whereby the General Court annulled Article 1(1) and Article 4 of Commission Decision 2011/282/EU of 12 January 2011 on the tax amortisation of financial goodwill for foreign shareholding acquisitions C 45/07 (ex NN 51/07, ex CP 9/07) implemented by Spain (OJ 2011 L 135, p. 1; ‘the second contested decision’).\n\nBackground to the proceedings\n\n3\n\n\nThe background to the proceedings, as set out in the judgments under appeal, may be summarised as follows.\n\n4\n\n\nOn 10 October 2007, after a number of written questions had been sent to the Commission in 2005 and 2006 by Members of the European Parliament and after a private operator had submitted a complaint to it in 2007, the Commission decided to initiate the formal investigation procedure with respect to an arrangement laid down in a provision of Spanish corporate tax law introduced by Ley 24/2001, de Medidas Fiscales, Administrativas y del Orden Social (Law 24/2001 on fiscal, administrative and social measures) of 27 December 2001 (BOE No 313, of 31 December 2001, p. 50493), and reproduced in Real Decreto Legislativo 4/2004, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley del Impuesto sobre Sociedades (Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004 approving the recast text of the Corporate Tax Law; ‘TRLIS’) of 5 March 2004 (BOE No 61, of 11 March 2004, p. 10951), namely Article 12(5) TRLIS (‘the measure at issue’).\n\n5\n\n\nThe measure at issue provides that, in the event that an undertaking taxable in Spain acquires a shareholding in a ‘foreign company’ equal to at least 5% of that company’s capital and retains that shareholding for an uninterrupted period of at least one year, the goodwill resulting from that shareholding, as recorded in the undertaking’s accounts as a separate intangible asset, may be deducted, in the form of an amortisation, from the basis of assessment for the corporation tax for which the undertaking is liable. The measure at issue states that, to be classified as a ‘foreign company’, a company must be liable to pay a tax that is identical to the tax applicable in Spain and its income must derive mainly from business activities carried out abroad.\n\n6\n\n\nIn paragraphs 10 to 13 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission, which are identical to paragraphs 15 to 18 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court added the following:\n\n‘10\n\n\nIt follows from the [first] contested decision that, under Spanish law, a business combination is an operation whereby one or more companies, on being dissolved without going into liquidation, transfer all their assets and liabilities to another existing company or to a company that they form in exchange for the issue to their shareholders of securities representing the capital of that other company (recital 23 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 32 of the second contested decision]).\n\n11\n\n\nIn the [first] contested decision, share acquisition is to mean an operation whereby one company acquires a shareholding in the capital of another company without obtaining a majority or the control of the voting rights of the target company (recital 23 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 32 of the second contested decision]).\n\n12\n\n\nFurthermore, it is stated in the [first] contested decision that, according to the measure at issue, the financial goodwill is determined by deducting the market value of the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired company from the acquisition price paid for the shareholding. It is also stated that the concept of financial goodwill, as referred to in the measure at issue, introduces into the field of share acquisitions a concept that is usually used in transfers of assets or business combination transactions (recital 20 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 29 of the second contested decision]).\n\n13\n\n\nFinally, it should be noted that under Spanish tax law, the acquisition by an undertaking which is taxable in Spain of a shareholding in a company established in Spain does not allow the goodwill resulting from that acquisition to be recorded separately for tax purposes. However, again according to Spanish tax law, goodwill can be amortised [only in the case of] a business combination (recital 19 of the [first] contested decision[, identical to recital 28 of the second contested decision]).’\n\n7\n\n\nBy the first contested decision, the Commission concluded the procedure with respect to shareholding acquisitions within the European Union.\n\n8\n\n\nIn Article 1(1) of that decision, the Commission declared incompatible with the common market the scheme introduced by the measure at issue (‘the scheme at issue’), whereby a tax advantage was granted to undertakings taxable in Spain in order to enable them to amortise the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shareholdings in foreign undertakings, where it was applied to acquisitions of shareholdings in undertakings established within the European Union. In Article 4 of that decision, the Commission ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid granted under that scheme.\n\n9\n\n\nThe Commission maintained open, however, the procedure as regards acquisitions of shareholdings outside the European Union, the Spanish authorities having given an undertaking that they would provide further details concerning the obstacles to cross-border mergers outside the European Union.\n\n10\n\n\nBy the second contested decision, the Commission declared incompatible with the common market the scheme at issue, whereby a tax advantage was granted to undertakings taxable in Spain in order to enable them to amortise the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shareholdings in foreign undertakings, where it applied to acquisitions of shareholdings in undertakings established outside the European Union (Article 1(1) of that decision), and ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid granted under that scheme (Article 4 of that decision).\n\nThe procedure before the General Court and the judgments under appeal\n\n11\n\n\n By an application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 May 2010, Autogrill España SA, now World Duty Free Group SA (‘WDFG’), brought an action seeking the annulment of Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the first contested decision. \n\n12\n\n\nIn support of its action in so far as it is directed against Article 1(1) of that decision, WDFG relied on four pleas in law: (i) an error of law in the Commission’s application of the condition relating to selectivity; (ii) the measure at issue is not selective in so far as the differentiation that it introduces flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which it is part; (iii) the measure provides no advantage to companies to which the scheme at issue applies; and (iv) with respect to both the criterion relating to selectivity and that relating to the existence of an advantage, a failure to state adequate reasons for that decision.\n\n13\n\n\nBy an application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 29 July 2011,  Banco Santander SA and Santusa Holding SL (‘Santusa’) brought an action seeking the annulment of Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the second contested decision. \n\n14\n\n\nIn support of their action in so far as directed against Article 1(1) of that decision, Banco Santander and Santusa relied on five pleas in law: (i) an error of law in the Commission’s application of the condition relating to selectivity; (ii) an error in identifying the reference system; (iii) the measure at issue is not selective in so far as the differentiation that it introduces is a result of the nature or general structure of the system of which it is part; (iv) the measure provides no advantage to the companies to which the scheme at issue applies; and (v) with respect to both the criterion relating to selectivity and that relating to the existence of an advantage, a failure to state adequate reasons for the contested decision.\n\n15\n\n\nIn the judgments under appeal, the General Court, on essentially identical grounds, upheld the first plea of law in each of the two actions, namely that Article 107(1) TFEU had been misapplied with respect to the condition relating to selectivity, and consequently annulled Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the contested decisions, without examining the other pleas raised in those actions. \n\nForm of order sought by the parties and procedures before the Court\n\n16\n\n\nThe Commission claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgments under appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nrefer the respective cases back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\nreserve the costs. \n\n17\n\n\nWDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P, contend that the Court should dismiss the appeals, uphold the judgments under appeal and order the Commission to pay the costs.\n\n18\n\n\nBy decisions of the President of the Court of 19 May 2015, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain were granted leave to intervene in support of the forms of order sought by WDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and by Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P.\n\n19\n\n\nOn the other hand, by orders of the President of the Court of 6 October 2015, the applications of Telefónica SA and Iberdrola SA for leave to intervene in support of the forms of order sought by WDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and by Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P, were refused.\n\nThe appeals\n\n20\n\n\nIn support of its appeals, the Commission relies on a single ground of appeal, which has two parts, consisting of the claim that the General Court erred in law in the interpretation of the condition relating to selectivity as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU. \n\nThe first part of the single ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n21\n\n\nBy the first part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law by holding that the Commission was obliged, in order to demonstrate that a measure is selective, to identify a group of undertakings with specific characteristics.\n\n22\n\n\nThe Commission maintains that, in the contested decisions, it rigorously followed the method for the analysis of selectivity in tax matters, as that method is set out in the Court’s settled case-law. The Commission accordingly established that the measure at issue constituted a derogation from a reference system, in that the effect of the measure was that the tax treatment of undertakings taxable in Spain acquiring shareholdings of at least 5% in companies established outside Spain differed from that applicable to undertakings taxable in Spain making identical acquisitions in companies established in Spain, although those two categories of undertakings were in comparable situations in the light of the objective pursued by the general Spanish system for the taxation of companies.\n\n23\n\n\nThe Commission considers that the General Court, by imposing on it the additional obligation of demonstrating that the measure at issue favours certain undertakings capable of identification by reason of characteristics specific to them that other undertakings do not possess, in other words ex ante identifiable features that are characteristic of them, erred in law, since, in so doing, the General Court attributed a meaning to the condition relating to selectivity that is more restrictive than that defined by the Court.\n\n24\n\n\nThe Commission maintains, in particular, that, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraphs 57 and 58 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 61 and 62 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, measures can be classified as selective even if those measures are to be applied regardless of the nature of the activities of the beneficiary and create a tax advantage for certain investment transactions without setting a minimum investment amount.\n\n25\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, in that context, the General Court erred in inferring from the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that a national measure which is to be applied regardless of the nature of the activity of undertakings is not, a priori, selective. The statement in paragraph 36 of that judgment, that ‘national measures such as those at issue in the main proceedings do not constitute State aid … if they apply to all undertakings in national territory, regardless of their activity’ should be understood to mean that the reason why there is no selectivity is that the national measure applies indiscriminately to all undertakings in the Member State concerned.\n\n26\n\n\nThe Commission also claims that the General Court erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 59 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 63 to 66 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that a measure such as the measure at issue is not selective where it is linked to the purchase of particular financial assets, namely shareholdings in foreign companies, and where no category of undertakings is, a priori, excluded from benefiting from it.\n\n27\n\n\nThe Commission submits that the General Court wrongly relied in this regard on the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467). It follows from paragraphs 22 and 23 of that judgment that, in the case which gave rise to it, the Commission had classified the measure concerned as selective only in relation to certain geographically defined undertakings in which private investors had reinvested the profits from the sale of economic assets and not in relation to those investors themselves, for whom it had held that that measure did not constitute aid.\n\n28\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission criticises the General Court for having held, in paragraphs 66 to 68 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 70 to 72 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that it would be contrary to the case-law of the Court of Justice to regard as selective a national tax measure the benefit of which is subject to certain conditions, even though the beneficiary undertakings do not share any feature characteristic of them that distinguishes them from other undertakings, apart from the fact that they are capable of satisfying the conditions governing the application of the measure.\n\n29\n\n\nThe Commission submits that the General Court relies in that regard on an erroneous analysis of the case-law concerned.\n\n30\n\n\nWith respect to the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), the Commission argues that it is clear from paragraphs 90 and 91 of that judgment that that case concerned a particular situation in which the Court considered the reference tax system itself to be selective, in that it favoured ‘offshore’ undertakings as such, rather than any derogation from it. The reference made in that judgment to the ‘specific properties’ of a category of undertakings should therefore be understood as referring to the characteristics by reason of which those undertakings were favoured for tax purposes under a reference system that was inherently selective and cannot be extrapolated beyond that particular context.\n\n31\n\n\nAs regards paragraph 42 of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), the General Court failed to take into account the second sentence of that paragraph, which sets out the principle, enshrined in the Court’s settled case-law, that a measure is selective if it is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings, who are, in the light of the objective pursued by the scheme, in a comparable factual and legal situation.\n\n32\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa submit, first, that the Commission did not maintain, in the contested decisions, that the measure at issue was de facto selective, and, consequently, the present appeals are concerned only with examining the criticisms directed against the judgments under appeal to the effect that the General Court held that the grounds relied on by the Commission in those decisions did not support the conclusion that that measure was de jure selective.\n\n33\n\n\nThey contend that it follows from the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that a measure from which all undertakings can benefit cannot be considered to be selective. That judgment does not however permit the inference, as claimed by the Commission, that a national measure is not selective where it applies to all the undertakings in a Member State without exception, since, if that argument were valid, almost all tax rules would have to be considered to be selective.\n\n34\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa also dispute the Commission’s argument that national tax measures have on many occasions previously been classified as selective even though they set no minimum investment amount and applied regardless of the nature of the beneficiary’s activities. In any event, the measure at issue, in that it confers a tax advantage on any undertaking that wishes to benefit from it, irrespective of which category it falls into, for that reason alone cannot be deemed to be prima facie and de jure selective.\n\n35\n\n\nThe General Court was correct to rely on the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), since, in the decision that was at issue in that judgment, the Commission had expressly accepted that the national measure was not selective as regards the investors concerned, a position confirmed by the Court.\n\n36\n\n\nIn its decision-making practice, moreover, the Commission has on many occasions previously found tax measures not to be selective on the basis of the same criterion, in other words that general measures which are applicable to all undertakings without distinction and of which all taxable persons may take advantage are not selective.\n\n37\n\n\nWhat is more, the application of that criterion would not lead to a finding that measures relating to the purchase of certain assets as referred to by the Commission were not selective. Such measures could be classified as selective if it were shown that they do in fact benefit certain undertakings to the exclusion of others. In any event, their selectivity would follow not from the nature of the assets acquired but from the fact that it is legitimate to hold that the purchasers concerned form a particular category.\n\n38\n\n\nWith regard to the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa take the view that the General Court was right to consider that the measure at issue in the case which gave rise to that judgment differs from that in the present case, since it was intended to confer an advantage on a distinct and identifiable category of undertakings, that is to say those engaged in exporting.\n\n39\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa further submit that it follows clearly from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), and in particular paragraph 104 thereof, that a measure can be classified as selective only if it benefits a category of undertakings sharing ‘properties’ which are ‘specific’ to them. It follows moreover from that judgment that the identification of a derogation from an ordinary system is not an end in itself. All that matters is the actual effect of the measure, namely the fact that it does or does not benefit specific undertakings or the production of specific goods.\n\n40\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa argue that the interpretation of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), advocated by the Commission, can again not be accepted. First, in that judgment, the Court did not uphold the definition of a reference system and a derogation from that system. Second, that judgment does not permit a conclusion that a measure is selective by reason of the fact that the undertakings which satisfy the conditions to benefit from that measure form a distinct category.\n\n41\n\n\nLast, the General Court was correct to hold that a measure cannot be classified as selective, within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU, if the benefit of that measure depends on conduct that is prima facie open to any undertaking, irrespective of an undertaking’s sector of activity. That follows from the finding, in the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), that a national measure was not selective as regards investors.\n\n42\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain submits that the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598) confirms the position taken by the Spanish authorities during the administrative procedure before the Commission, to the effect that an economic advantage can be classified as aid only if it is capable of favouring ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n43\n\n\nIn the course of that administrative procedure, the Spanish authorities demonstrated that the measure at issue was generally accessible, on the ground that it was applied to undertakings active in very different business sectors, thereby supporting the analysis set out in the judgments under appeal and the fact that the Commission had failed in the contested decisions to demonstrate that that measure was selective.\n\n44\n\n\nIreland submits that, contrary to what is argued by the Commission, the General Court did not infer from the judgment of the Court of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), and the judgments of the General Court of 6 March 2002, Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission (T‑92/00 and T‑103/00, EU:T:2002:61), and of 9 September 2009, Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission (T‑227/01 to T‑229/01, T‑265/01, T‑266/01 and T‑270/01, EU:T:2009:315), that only measures the application of which was linked to the nature of the undertaking’s activities or the application of which was dependent on a minimum amount were selective, but held that selectivity could not be established with respect to a measure from which all undertakings resident for tax purposes in Spain and making acquisitions of at least 5% shareholdings in foreign undertakings could benefit, regardless of the nature of their activities and the amounts invested.\n\n45\n\n\nThe General Court was correct to rely on the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), in order to hold that it was necessary, if different tax treatment was to be classified as aid, that a particular category of undertakings capable of benefiting should be identified, by reason of their specific properties. The condition relating to selectivity as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU should moreover be defined in the same way in all cases concerning alleged State aid of a fiscal nature. Accordingly, the principle expressly stated in paragraph 104 of that judgment cannot be limited to a situation in which a tax system taken as a whole is selective.\n\n46\n\n\nIreland considers that measures such as the measure at issue, which do not a priori exclude any undertaking or any particular economic sector from the ambit of its recipients, cannot be regarded as being selective. The Commission has on several occasions previously relied on that ground in order to determine that certain national measures are not selective.\n\n47\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany submits that the existence, even if it were established, of a derogation from or exception to the reference framework identified by the Commission is not, in itself, sufficient to conclude that the measure at issue favours ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n48\n\n\nOn the contrary, it follows only that that measure is similar to a subsidy. Consequently, after an examination designed to determine that the measure has the nature of a derogation, it is appropriate, in accordance with the case-law and, in particular, the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), and as the General Court correctly held in the judgments under appeal, thereafter to determine whether the category of taxpayers favoured by a tax measure involves sufficiently specific undertakings or the production of sufficiently specific goods within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows accordingly from the Court’s case-law that the category of undertakings which receive a tax advantage is sufficiently specified where the Commission has been able to demonstrate that the advantage concerned was for the benefit of only undertakings belonging to a single economic sector and carrying out particular transactions (judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774), only undertakings that have a particular legal form (judgment of 10 January 2006, Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others, C‑222/04, EU:C:2006:8), only undertakings of a certain size (judgment of 13 February 2003, Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92) or only undertakings resident for tax purposes outside the territory of a region (judgment of 17 November 2009Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri, C‑169/08, EU:C:2009:709).\n\n50\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany recalls that the Court has previously held that a tax concession in favour of taxpayers who sell certain financial assets and can offset the resulting profit when they acquire other financial assets confers on them an advantage which, as a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators, cannot be classified as State aid (judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission, C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467, paragraph 22).\n\n51\n\n\nA fortiori, therefore, a tax measure such as that at issue, the application of which is generally linked to a certain category of transactions falling within the scope of company law, in this instance the acquisition of shareholdings, regardless of the object and business activities of the undertaking, should not be considered to be selective.\n\n52\n\n\nLast, the Member States intervening in these cases submit that, if the selectivity of a national measure as a condition for its classification as State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, were to be understood in the broad sense advocated by the Commission in its appeals, the consequence would be an undermining of the division of powers within the European Union. If such scope were to be conferred on the selectivity condition, the Commission could review almost all direct tax measures by virtue of its powers in the field of State aid, although direct taxation falls, as a general rule, within the legislative competence of the Member States.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n53\n\n\n First, it must be recalled that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, classification of a national measure as ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, requires all the following conditions to be fulfilled. First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources. Second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between the Member States. Third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient. Fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, inter alia, judgment of 16 July 2015, BVVG, C‑39/14, EU:C:2015:470, paragraph 24).\n\n54\n\n\nSo far as concerns the condition relating to the selectivity of the advantage, which is a constituent factor in the concept of ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, it is clear from equally settled case-law of the Court that  the assessment of that condition requires a determination whether, under a particular legal regime, a national measure is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation and who accordingly suffer different treatment that can, in essence, be classified as discriminatory  (see, inter alia, judgments of 28 July 2011, Mediaset v Commission, C‑403/10 P, not published, EU:C:2011:533, paragraph 36; of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 75 and 101; and of 14 January 2015, Eventech, C‑518/13, EU:C:2015:9, paragraphs 53 to 55; and of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C‑15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 59).\n\n55\n\n\nFurther, where the measure at issue is conceived as an aid scheme and not as individual aid, it is for the Commission to establish that that measure, although it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or certain sectors of activity (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraphs 49 and 50).\n\n56\n\n\nAs regards, in particular,  national measures that confer a tax advantage, it must be recalled that a measure of that nature which, although not involving the transfer of State resources, places the recipients in a more favourable position than other taxpayers is capable of procuring a selective advantage for the recipients and, consequently, of constituting State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.On the other hand, a tax advantage resulting from a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators does not constitute such aid  (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 18 July 2013, P,C‑6/12, EU:C:2013:525, paragraph 18).\n\n57\n\n\nIn that context, in order to classify a national tax measure as ‘selective’, the Commission must begin by identifying the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, and thereafter demonstrate that the tax measure at issue is a derogation from that ordinary system, in so far as it differentiates between operators who, in the light of the objective pursued by that ordinary tax system, are in a comparable factual and legal situation (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraph 49).\n\n58\n\n\nThe concept of ‘State aid’ does not, however, cover measures that differentiate between undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by the legal regime concerned, are in a comparable factual and legal situation, and are, therefore, a priori selective, where the Member State concerned is able to demonstrate that that differentiation is justified since it flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which the measures form part (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgments of 29 April 2004, Netherlands v Commission, C‑159/01, EU:C:2004:246, paragraphs 42 and 43; of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraphs 64 and 65; and of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 40).\n\n59\n\n\nFurther, it must be recalled that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for the application of a measure can benefit from the measure cannot, in itself, make it into a selective measure (judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 42).\n\n60\n\n\nIt follows from all the foregoing that  the appropriate criterion for establishing the selectivity of the measure at issue consists in determining whether that measure introduces, between operators that are, in the light of the objective pursued by the general tax system concerned, in a comparable factual and legal situation, a distinction that is not justified by the nature and general structure of that system  (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C‑15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 61).\n61\n\n\nThose are the factors that must guide the Court’s examination of whether, in this case, the General Court misconstrued Article 107(1) TFEU, as interpreted by the Court, by holding that the Commission had not, in the contested decisions, demonstrated to the requisite legal standard that the measure at issue conferred a selective advantage on ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’.\n\n62\n\n\nIn this case, the measure at issue confers a tax advantage that consists in a deduction from the taxable base for corporation tax in the form of an amortisation of the goodwill resulting from the acquisition by undertakings resident for tax purposes in Spain of at least 5% shareholdings in undertakings resident for tax purposes outside that Member State. That measure must, since it is capable of conferring an advantage on all such undertakings which carry out such transactions, be regarded as capable of constituting an aid scheme. It was therefore for the Commission to establish that that measure, notwithstanding that it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or on certain sectors of activity.\n\n63\n\n\nIn that regard, the General Court stated, in paragraph 50 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 54 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Commission, in order to establish that the measure at issue was selective, had primarily relied, in the contested decisions, on the ground that that measure constitutes a derogation from a reference system, in that the effect of that measure was the application to undertakings taxable in Spain, acquiring shareholdings in companies established outside Spain, of a tax treatment that differed from that applied to undertakings taxable in Spain making such acquisitions in companies established in Spain, although those two categories of undertakings were in comparable situations in the light of the objective pursued by that reference system, namely the general Spanish system for the taxation of companies and, more specifically, the rules relating to the tax treatment of financial goodwill within that tax system.\n\n64\n\n\nThe General Court held, in paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Commission had thereby applied the analytical method that may be deduced from the case-law of the Court and of the General Court cited, respectively, in paragraphs 29 to 33 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 33 to 37 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, which essentially corresponds to the Court’s case-law cited in paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment.\n\n65\n\n\nHowever, in paragraphs 44, 45, 52 and 53 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 48, 49, 56 and 57 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court held that the existence, were it to be established, of a derogation or an exception to the reference system identified by the Commission was not sufficient, in itself, to establish that the measure at issue favoured ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, since that measure was accessible, a priori, to any undertaking and it was directed not to a particular category of undertakings, which would have been the only undertakings favoured by that measure, but to a category of economic transactions.\n\n66\n\n\nIt is, however, clear that that reasoning is based on a misapplication of the selectivity condition laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU, as described in this judgment.\n\n67\n\n\nAs is apparent from paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment,  with respect to a national measure conferring a tax advantage of general application, such as the measure at issue, that condition is satisfied where the Commission is able to demonstrate that that measure is a derogation from the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, thereby introducing, through its actual effects, differences in the treatment of operators, although the operators who qualify for the tax advantage and those who do not are, in the light of the objective pursued by that Member State’s tax system, in a comparable factual and legal situation.\n\n68\n\n\nIt is apparent from the judgments under appeal that the Commission relied, in the contested decisions, in order to establish that the measure at issue was selective, on the fact that the consequence of that measure was that resident undertakings were not treated equally. Pursuant to that measure, only resident undertakings who acquired at least 5% shareholdings in foreign companies could, under certain conditions, qualify for the tax advantage at issue, whereas resident undertakings making the acquisition of such a shareholding in undertakings taxable in Spain could not obtain that advantage, notwithstanding the fact that, according to the Commission, they were in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary Spanish tax system.\n\n69\n\n\nHowever, the General Court considered that the measure at issue, on the grounds that it did not affect any particular category of undertakings or the production of any particular category of goods, that it was applicable regardless of the nature of an undertaking’s activity and that it was accessible, a priori or potentially, to all undertakings that wanted to acquire shareholdings of at least 5% in foreign companies and that held those shareholdings without interruption for at least one year, had to be regarded not as a selective measure but as a general measure within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 56 of this judgment. In so doing, the General Court erred in law.\n\n70\n\n\nThus, in paragraphs 41, 45, 67 and 68 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 45, 49, 71 and 72 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court held that, if the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure relevant to the recognition of State aid, in respect of a measure that is a priori accessible to any undertaking, is to be satisfied, it is always necessary that a particular category of undertakings, who are exclusively favoured by the measure concerned and who can be distinguished by reason of specific properties, common to them and characteristic of them, be identified.\n\n71\n\n\nHowever, the imposition of such a supplementary requirement to identify a particular category of undertakings, additional to the analytical method applicable to selectivity in tax matters that may be deduced from the Court’s settled case-law, which essentially involves ascertaining whether the exclusion of certain operators from the benefit of a tax advantage that arises from a measure derogating from an ordinary tax system constitutes discrimination with respect to those operators, cannot be inferred from the Court’s case-law and, in particular, from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732).\n\n72\n\n\nIt is true that, in paragraph 104 of that judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), the Court held that, in order to be capable of being recognised as conferring selective advantages, the criteria forming the basis of assessment which are adopted by a tax system must be such as to characterise the recipient undertakings, by virtue of properties which are specific to them, as a privileged category, thus permitting such a regime to be described as favouring ‘certain’ undertakings or the production of ‘certain’ goods, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n73\n\n\nHowever, that ground of the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), must be read in the context of the set of grounds of which it forms part, set out in paragraphs 87 to 108 of that judgment.\n\n74\n\n\nIt follows from a reading of all those grounds that the measure at issue in that judgment did not take the form of a tax advantage that derogated from an ordinary tax system, but rather involved the application of a ‘general’ tax scheme based on criteria that were, in themselves, also general. The Court held that the nature of that scheme did not preclude a finding that the measure concerned was selective, contrary to the ruling of the General Court, since the condition relating to selectivity has a broader scope that extends to measures which, by their effects, favour certain undertakings, in that case ‘offshore’ companies, on account of the specific features characteristic of those undertakings. That measure accordingly operated de facto discrimination against undertakings that were in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, in that case the objective of putting in place generalised taxation of all resident companies.\n\n75\n\n\nBy contrast, as stated above in paragraph 63 of this judgment, in the contested decisions, the Commission, in order to establish the selectivity of the measure at issue, relied primarily on the ground that the consequence of that measure is discrimination, in that it confers a tax advantage on certain resident undertakings and not on others who are subject to the same ordinary tax system from which the measure at issue is a derogation.\n\n76\n\n\nWhile it therefore follows from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), that the selectivity of a tax measure can be established even if that measure does not constitute a derogation from an ordinary tax system, but is an integral part of that system, the fact remains that that judgment is consistent with the Court’s settled case-law, cited in paragraph 57 of this judgment, to the effect that it is sufficient, in order to establish the selectivity of a measure that derogates from an ordinary tax system, to demonstrate that that measure benefits certain operators and not others, although all those operators are in an objectively comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary tax system.\n\n77\n\n\nIndeed, while it is not always necessary that a tax measure, in order for it to be established that it is selective, should derogate from an ordinary tax system, the fact that it can be so characterised is highly relevant in that regard where the effect of that measure is that two categories of operators are distinguished and are subject, a priori, to different treatment, namely those who fall within the scope of the derogating measure and those who continue to fall within the scope of the ordinary tax system, although those two categories are in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by that system.\n78\n\n\nContrary to what was held by the General Court in the judgments under appeal,  neither can it be required of the Commission, in order to establish the selectivity of such a measure, that it should identify certain specific features that are characteristic of and common to the undertakings that are the recipients of the tax advantage, by which they can be distinguished from those undertakings that are excluded from the advantage.\n\n79\n\n\nAll that matters in that regard is the fact that the measure, irrespective of its form or the legislative means used, should have the effect of placing the recipient undertakings in a position that is more favourable than that of other undertakings, although all those undertakings are in a comparable factual and legal situation in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned.\n80\n\n\nFurther, according to the Court’s settled case-law, the fact that the number of undertakings able to claim entitlement under a national measure is very large, or that those undertakings belong to various economic sectors, is not sufficient to call into question the selective nature of that measure and, therefore, to rule out its classification as State aid (see, inter alia, judgments of 13 February 2003, Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92, paragraph 48, and of 8 September 2011, Commission v Netherlands, C‑279/08 P, EU:C:2011:551, paragraph 50).\n\n81\n\n\nAccordingly, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraphs 53 to 58 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 57 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the potentially selective nature of the measure at issue is in no way called into question by the fact that the essential condition for obtaining the tax advantage conferred by that measure is that there should be an economic transaction, more particularly an ‘entirely financial’ transaction, for which no minimum investment is required and which is available regardless of the nature of the business of the recipient undertakings.\n\n82\n\n\nIn that context, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraph 57 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 61 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, it cannot be inferred from paragraph 36 of the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), according to which measures are not selective where they apply to all the undertakings in the national territory, ‘regardless of their activity’, that a measure whose application does not depend on the nature of the undertakings’ activity is, a priori, not selective.\n\n83\n\n\nIt is apparent from reading all the grounds of that judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer  Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that, in paragraph 36, read in the light of paragraph 35 of that judgment, the Court held that national measures, such as those at issue in that case, were not selective where they applied indiscriminately to all undertakings in the Member State concerned and constituted, for that reason, a general measure within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 56 of the present judgment.\n\n84\n\n\nIt must also be made clear that while the Court, in paragraph 36 of the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), referred to the activity of undertakings benefiting from the national measures, that reference is explained by the wording of the second question submitted by the referring court in the case that gave rise to that judgment.  That is confirmed by the fact that no such reference is made in the subsequent judgments of the Court which restate that principle (see, inter alia, judgments of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 73, and of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 39).\n\n85\n\n\nMoreover, it is true, as stated by the General Court in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Court held, in paragraph 42 of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for application of the measure concerned in that case could benefit from that measure could not, in itself, make it a selective measure. However, it must be noted that, in that same paragraph, the Court expressly stated that the absence of selectivity was due to the finding that persons who were not eligible for the measure concerned were not in a factual and legal situation comparable to that of taxpayers who were eligible, in the light of the objective pursued by the national legislature.\n\n86\n\n\nIt follows that a condition for the application or the receipt of tax aid may be grounds for a finding that that aid is selective, if that condition leads to a distinction being made between undertakings despite the fact that they are, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, in a comparable factual and legal situation, and if, therefore, it represents discrimination against undertakings which are excluded from it.\n\n87\n\n\nFurther, while, as stated by the General Court in the judgments under appeal,  the tax advantage conferred by the measure at issue can be obtained without any minimum investment requirement and without, consequently, the benefit of that measure being reserved to undertakings having sufficient financial resources, those factors do not preclude the possibility of that measure being classified as selective for other reasons, such as the fact that resident undertakings making acquisitions of shareholdings in companies resident for tax purposes in Spain could not obtain that advantage.\n\n88\n\n\nIn that regard, it may be added that the Court has previously ruled that a tax measure from which solely undertakings that carried out specified transactions benefited, and not undertakings in the same sector that did not carry out those transactions, could be classified as selective, there being no need to assess whether that measure was of greater benefit to large undertakings (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774, paragraphs 47 to 50).\n\n89\n\n\nContrary to the General Court’s assertion in paragraphs 59 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 63 to 66 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, no indication to the contrary as regards the analysis of the condition relating to the selectivity of a tax measure may be deduced from the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467).\n\n90\n\n\nIt follows from paragraphs 22 and 23 of the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), that, in the case that gave rise to that judgment, the Commission had classified the measure concerned as selective in relation to certain geographically defined undertakings in which private investors had reinvested the profits derived from sales of financial assets and not in relation to those investors themselves, with respect to whom the Commission had considered that that measure did not constitute aid, since, as a general measure, it benefited all operators indiscriminately, an assessment that was, moreover, not challenged before the Court and on which the Court therefore did not have to give a ruling.\n\n91\n\n\nIn any event, the situation of those private investors cannot be treated as equivalent to that of the resident undertakings that can benefit from the measure at issue.\n\n92\n\n\nIn the contested decisions,  the Commission, in order to classify the measure at issue as a selective measure, relied on the fact that the tax advantage conferred by that measure did not indiscriminately benefit all economic operators who were objectively in a comparable situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary Spanish tax system, since resident undertakings acquiring shareholdings of the same kind in companies resident for tax purposes in Spain could not obtain that advantage. The Commission then considered that the justification of that distinction between operators, relied on by the Kingdom of Spain, based on the nature or general structure of the system of which that measure formed part, could not be accepted.\n93\n\n\nIt follows from all the foregoing that the General Court erred in law, in annulling the contested decisions, in part, on the ground that the Commission had failed to define a particular category of undertakings favoured by the tax measure at issue, while omitting to determine whether the Commission, in applying the method of examination, described in paragraphs 29 to 33 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 33 to 37 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, which must be used in order to examine the condition relating to the selectivity of the measure at issue, had in fact analysed the question and had established that that measure was discriminatory.\n\n94\n\n\nWhile, indeed, that examination must be carried out rigorously and while sufficient reasons must be stated to permit full judicial review, in particular of the question whether the situation of operators benefiting from the measure is comparable with that of operators excluded from it and, where appropriate, of the justification for discrimination relied on by the Member State concerned, the fact remains that the General Court erred in law by not undertaking such a review, and by ruling, in the judgments under appeal, that the examination method applied by the Commission in the contested decisions, in failing to define a particular category of undertakings which were exclusively favoured by the tax measure at issue, was based on a misinterpretation of the condition relating to selectivity as laid down by Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n95\n\n\nConsequently, the first part of the Commission’s single ground of appeal is well founded.\n\nThe second part of the single ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n96\n\n\nBy the second part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law in applying the case-law relating to aid for exports and introduced an artificial distinction between aid for exports of goods and aid for exports of capital.\n\n97\n\n\nAs regards, first, the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law, in holding in paragraphs 69 to 76 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 73 to 80 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that that case-law concerns not the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure, but only the condition relating to the effect on competition and trade.\n\n98\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, it is apparent from the judgments cited in the preceding paragraph that the Court considered that the tax measures concerned were selective, on the ground that the benefit of them was reserved to undertakings that carried out transactions abroad, such as investments, and not to undertakings carrying out similar transactions domestically. The Commission maintains that it follows that any measure that is to the benefit of cross-border transactions, but excludes the same domestic transactions, is selective.\n\n99\n\n\nSecond, the Commission claims that General Court was wrong to introduce, in paragraphs 79 to 81 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 83 to 85 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, an artificial distinction between aid for exports and aid for export of capital in holding that it followed from the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), that ‘the category of recipient undertakings allowing a finding that the measure at issue was selective was made up of [exporting] undertakings’, a category bringing together undertakings which could be distinguished by reason of their common characteristics linked to their export activity.\n\n100\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, the undertakings affected by the measure at issue constitute a distinct category of undertakings, namely that of undertakings that export capital, since they share specific common characteristics linked to their activity of exporting capital.\n\n101\n\n\nThe Commission considers that, since, with respect to the condition relating to selectivity, there is no difference between the export of goods and the export of capital, the measure at issue was selective to the same degree as the measures concerned in the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions.\n\n102\n\n\nThe Commission maintains that a category of exporting undertakings does not exist, as something separate from the group of undertakings that carry out cross-border transactions. Any undertaking within a Member State can carry out a cross-border transaction and, thereby, qualify for an export aid scheme. The Commission considers that a national measure may become selective because of the advantage granted to the beneficiary of the measure, as a result of carrying out an export transaction, of goods, services or capital, and not by reason of the fact that the undertakings concerned are members of an alleged export sector.\n\n103\n\n\nAccordingly, as the Court ruled in the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), in a situation comparable to that in this case, the General Court ought to have held that the Commission had properly established the selectivity of the measure at issue by reason of the fact that the benefit of that measure was reserved to certain undertakings, namely those which were engaged in the activity of exporting capital.\n\n104\n\n\nLast, the approach adopted the General Court ignores the role and purpose of the body of State aid rules in relation to the protection of the internal market. That body of rules is intended in particular to ensure that Member States do not grant economic advantages specifically linked to the export of goods or capital. The act of specifically favouring exports of capital could give rise to distortions in the internal market in the same way as the act of specifically favouring exports of goods. \n\n105\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa contend that the General Court was correct to hold that the judgments of the Court relied on in the contested decisions concerned not the condition relating to selectivity, but the conditions relating to the effect on trade.\n\n106\n\n\nFurther, the General Court was correct to hold that, in the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Court considered that the measures concerned were selective, the principal ground being that the recipient undertakings shared certain characteristics, a factor that allowed the conclusion that those undertakings belonged to a particular sector of the economy, namely the export sector, more specifically the goods exporting sector. The measures at issue in the cases that gave rise those judgments favoured undertakings of which it was a characteristic feature that they exported a more or less significant part of their goods or services.\n\n107\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa argue that the measure at issue cannot, moreover, be considered to be selective on the ground that it applies to the category of undertakings described as ‘exporters of capital’.\n\n108\n\n\nSuch a category does not exist, and the Commission referred to it neither in the contested decisions nor before the General Court. That argument is inadmissible in an appeal, since it concerns a question of fact that is moreover raised out of time. It may be added that the argument contradicts the Commission’s main line of argument, that the Commission was not obliged to identify a category of undertakings that were affected by a measure in order to establish the selectivity of that measure.\n\n109\n\n\nIn any event, WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa contend that the selectivity of a national measure cannot be ascertained on the basis of characteristics such as the capital of an undertaking or its capacity to invest, since such characteristics are inherent in any undertaking.\n\n110\n\n\nIn addition, the rules governing the free movement of capital do not preclude a measure such as the measure at issue. While that measure involved different treatment that favours acquisitions of shareholdings abroad, that is at most reverse discrimination which is compatible with the fundamental freedoms.\n\n111\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain restates its position, previously argued in the administrative procedure before the Commission, that there is no economic activity that consists of exporting capital. The measure at issue does not favour certain undertakings or the production of certain goods since it is not concerned with the supply of goods and services on the market.\n\n112\n\n\nIreland maintains that the judgments relied on by the Commission in the contested decisions concerned measures which favoured a readily identifiable category of undertakings or the production of a readily identifiable category of goods, namely those involved in the export sector. However, there is no coherent category of undertakings that ‘export capital’, since any undertaking that makes an acquisition abroad ‘exports capital’.\n\n113\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany argues that the Commission’s submission in the alternative that the measure at issue is comparable to a measure granting aid for the export of goods and is therefore also aimed at the sufficiently delimited category of exporting undertakings has to be regarded as a retrospective addition of grounds to the contested decisions. The Federal Republic of Germany considers that that argument must be declared to be inadmissible on appeal.\n\n114\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany contends that the category of exporting undertakings at issue in the case-law relied on by the Commission in the contested decisions is distinct from other undertakings because of common characteristics linked to their exporting activity, which, in some cases, was connected to the making of specific investments.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n115\n\n\nAs regards the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), it is clear that, as stated, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 126 to 130 of his Opinion, the General Court erred in law, in holding, in paragraphs 69 to 76 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 73 to 80 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that that case-law did not concern the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure, but only the condition relating to the question whether competition and trade were affected.\n\n116\n\n\nIn paragraph 20 of the judgment of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), and in paragraph 8 of the judgment of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), the Court, in finding that there was State aid, necessarily held that all the conditions laid down on that subject in Article 107(1) TFEU, including the condition relating to selectivity, were satisfied. Further, in paragraph 120 of the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Court, referring, inter alia, to the two abovementioned judgments, expressly stated its position on the selectivity of the national measure under examination, holding that, in that case, selectivity followed from the fact that only undertakings engaged in export activities and carrying out certain investment transactions abroad qualified for the tax advantage conferred by that measure.\n\n117\n\n\nThe General Court also erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 77 to 82 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 81 to 86 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions had to be understood as meaning that the category of recipient undertakings with respect to whom the selectivity of export aid schemes must be examined was that constituted by ‘export undertakings’, which had to be defined as a category, which, while admittedly extremely broad, is nevertheless defined, comprising undertakings that could be distinguished by reason of specific, shared characteristics linked to their exporting activity.\n\n118\n\n\nAs observed, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 133 to 136 of his Opinion, that case-law cannot be understood as meaning that a national measure must necessarily be classified as selective where that measure benefits exclusively undertakings that export goods or services, even if, in fact, that may have been the case with respect to the particular tax measures at issue in the judgments concerned.\n\n119\n\n\nOn the contrary, taking into consideration the principles enshrined in the Court’s settled case-law, as set out above in paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment, which are entirely applicable to tax aid for exports, a measure such as the measure at issue, designed to facilitate exports, may be regarded as selective if it benefits undertakings carrying out cross-border transactions, in particular investment transactions, and is to the disadvantage of other undertakings which, while in a comparable factual and legal situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, carry out other transactions of the same kind within the national territory.\n\n120\n\n\nThat being the case, the second part of the single ground of appeal is also well founded.\n\n121\n\n\nConsequently, since both parts of the Commission’s single ground of appeal are well founded, the judgments under appeal must be set aside.\n\nThe actions before the General Court\n\n122\n\n\nIn accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, if the Court quashes the decision of the General Court, it may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n123\n\n\nThat is not the case here, since the General Court upheld the two actions for annulment but did not examine three of the four pleas in law relied on in each of those actions, pleas which only partly overlap, and did not examine, within its examination of the first pleas in law in those actions, whether those undertakings that did not meet the conditions for obtaining the tax advantage conferred by the measure at issue were, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, in a factual and legal situation comparable to that of the undertakings favoured by that measure. Further, examination of those pleas may involve assessment of matters of fact. The cases must therefore be referred back to the General Court.\n\nCosts\n\n124\n\n\nSince the cases are being referred back to the General Court, it is appropriate to reserve the costs.\n\n125\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain, as interveners, must bear their own costs.\n\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgments of the General Court of the European Union of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939), and of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938);\n\n\n2.\n\n\nRefers the cases back to the General Court of the European Union;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nReserves the costs;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain to bear their own costs\n"}

The measure at issue states that, to be classified as a ‘foreign company’, a company must be liable to pay a tax that is identical to the tax applicable in Spain and its income must derive mainly from business activities carried out abroad.\n\n6\n\n\nIn paragraphs 10 to 13 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission, which are identical to paragraphs 15 to 18 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court added the following:\n\n‘10\n\n\nIt follows from the [first] contested decision that, under Spanish law, a business combination is an operation whereby one or more companies, on being dissolved without going into liquidation, transfer all their assets and liabilities to another existing company or to a company that they form in exchange for the issue to their shareholders of securities representing the capital of that other company (recital 23 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 32 of the second contested decision]).\n\n11\n\n\nIn the [first] contested decision, share acquisition is to mean an operation whereby one company acquires a shareholding in the capital of another company without obtaining a majority or the control of the voting rights of the target company (recital 23 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 32 of the second contested decision]).\n\n12\n\n\nFurthermore, it is stated in the [first] contested decision that, according to the measure at issue, the financial goodwill is determined by deducting the market value of the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired company from the acquisition price paid for the shareholding. It is also stated that the concept of financial goodwill, as referred to in the measure at issue, introduces into the field of share acquisitions a concept that is usually used in transfers of assets or business combination transactions (recital 20 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 29 of the second contested decision]).\n\n13\n\n\nFinally, it should be noted that under Spanish tax law, the acquisition by an undertaking which is taxable in Spain of a shareholding in a company established in Spain does not allow the goodwill resulting from that acquisition to be recorded separately for tax purposes. However, again according to Spanish tax law, goodwill can be amortised [only in the case of] a business combination (recital 19 of the [first] contested decision[, identical to recital 28 of the second contested decision]).’\n\n7\n\n\nBy the first contested decision, the Commission concluded the procedure with respect to shareholding acquisitions within the European Union.\n\n8\n\n\nIn Article 1(1) of that decision, the Commission declared incompatible with the common market the scheme introduced by the measure at issue (‘the scheme at issue’), whereby a tax advantage was granted to undertakings taxable in Spain in order to enable them to amortise the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shareholdings in foreign undertakings, where it was applied to acquisitions of shareholdings in undertakings established within the European Union. In Article 4 of that decision, the Commission ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid granted under that scheme.\n\n9\n\n\nThe Commission maintained open, however, the procedure as regards acquisitions of shareholdings outside the European Union, the Spanish authorities having given an undertaking that they would provide further details concerning the obstacles to cross-border mergers outside the European Union.\n\n10\n\n\nBy the second contested decision, the Commission declared incompatible with the common market the scheme at issue, whereby a tax advantage was granted to undertakings taxable in Spain in order to enable them to amortise the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shareholdings in foreign undertakings, where it applied to acquisitions of shareholdings in undertakings established outside the European Union (Article 1(1) of that decision), and ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid granted under that scheme (Article 4 of that decision).\n\nThe procedure before the General Court and the judgments under appeal\n\n11\n\n\n By an application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 May 2010, Autogrill España SA, now World Duty Free Group SA (‘WDFG’), brought an action seeking the annulment of Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the first contested decision. \n\n12\n\n\nIn support of its action in so far as it is directed against Article 1(1) of that decision, WDFG relied on four pleas in law: (i) an error of law in the Commission’s application of the condition relating to selectivity; (ii) the measure at issue is not selective in so far as the differentiation that it introduces flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which it is part; (iii) the measure provides no advantage to companies to which the scheme at issue applies; and (iv) with respect to both the criterion relating to selectivity and that relating to the existence of an advantage, a failure to state adequate reasons for that decision.\n\n13\n\n\nBy an application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 29 July 2011,  Banco Santander SA and Santusa Holding SL (‘Santusa’) brought an action seeking the annulment of Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the second contested decision. \n\n14\n\n\nIn support of their action in so far as directed against Article 1(1) of that decision, Banco Santander and Santusa relied on five pleas in law: (i) an error of law in the Commission’s application of the condition relating to selectivity; (ii) an error in identifying the reference system; (iii) the measure at issue is not selective in so far as the differentiation that it introduces is a result of the nature or general structure of the system of which it is part; (iv) the measure provides no advantage to the companies to which the scheme at issue applies; and (v) with respect to both the criterion relating to selectivity and that relating to the existence of an advantage, a failure to state adequate reasons for the contested decision.\n\n15\n\n\nIn the judgments under appeal, the General Court, on essentially identical grounds, upheld the first plea of law in each of the two actions, namely that Article 107(1) TFEU had been misapplied with respect to the condition relating to selectivity, and consequently annulled Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the contested decisions, without examining the other pleas raised in those actions. \n\nForm of order sought by the parties and procedures before the Court\n\n16\n\n\nThe Commission claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgments under appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nrefer the respective cases back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\nreserve the costs. \n\n17\n\n\nWDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P, contend that the Court should dismiss the appeals, uphold the judgments under appeal and order the Commission to pay the costs.\n\n18\n\n\nBy decisions of the President of the Court of 19 May 2015, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain were granted leave to intervene in support of the forms of order sought by WDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and by Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P.\n\n19\n\n\nOn the other hand, by orders of the President of the Court of 6 October 2015, the applications of Telefónica SA and Iberdrola SA for leave to intervene in support of the forms of order sought by WDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and by Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P, were refused.\n\nThe appeals\n\n20\n\n\nIn support of its appeals, the Commission relies on a single ground of appeal, which has two parts, consisting of the claim that the General Court erred in law in the interpretation of the condition relating to selectivity as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU. \n\nThe first part of the single ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n21\n\n\nBy the first part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law by holding that the Commission was obliged, in order to demonstrate that a measure is selective, to identify a group of undertakings with specific characteristics.\n\n22\n\n\nThe Commission maintains that, in the contested decisions, it rigorously followed the method for the analysis of selectivity in tax matters, as that method is set out in the Court’s settled case-law. The Commission accordingly established that the measure at issue constituted a derogation from a reference system, in that the effect of the measure was that the tax treatment of undertakings taxable in Spain acquiring shareholdings of at least 5% in companies established outside Spain differed from that applicable to undertakings taxable in Spain making identical acquisitions in companies established in Spain, although those two categories of undertakings were in comparable situations in the light of the objective pursued by the general Spanish system for the taxation of companies.\n\n23\n\n\nThe Commission considers that the General Court, by imposing on it the additional obligation of demonstrating that the measure at issue favours certain undertakings capable of identification by reason of characteristics specific to them that other undertakings do not possess, in other words ex ante identifiable features that are characteristic of them, erred in law, since, in so doing, the General Court attributed a meaning to the condition relating to selectivity that is more restrictive than that defined by the Court.\n\n24\n\n\nThe Commission maintains, in particular, that, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraphs 57 and 58 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 61 and 62 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, measures can be classified as selective even if those measures are to be applied regardless of the nature of the activities of the beneficiary and create a tax advantage for certain investment transactions without setting a minimum investment amount.\n\n25\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, in that context, the General Court erred in inferring from the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that a national measure which is to be applied regardless of the nature of the activity of undertakings is not, a priori, selective. The statement in paragraph 36 of that judgment, that ‘national measures such as those at issue in the main proceedings do not constitute State aid … if they apply to all undertakings in national territory, regardless of their activity’ should be understood to mean that the reason why there is no selectivity is that the national measure applies indiscriminately to all undertakings in the Member State concerned.\n\n26\n\n\nThe Commission also claims that the General Court erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 59 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 63 to 66 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that a measure such as the measure at issue is not selective where it is linked to the purchase of particular financial assets, namely shareholdings in foreign companies, and where no category of undertakings is, a priori, excluded from benefiting from it.\n\n27\n\n\nThe Commission submits that the General Court wrongly relied in this regard on the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467). It follows from paragraphs 22 and 23 of that judgment that, in the case which gave rise to it, the Commission had classified the measure concerned as selective only in relation to certain geographically defined undertakings in which private investors had reinvested the profits from the sale of economic assets and not in relation to those investors themselves, for whom it had held that that measure did not constitute aid.\n\n28\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission criticises the General Court for having held, in paragraphs 66 to 68 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 70 to 72 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that it would be contrary to the case-law of the Court of Justice to regard as selective a national tax measure the benefit of which is subject to certain conditions, even though the beneficiary undertakings do not share any feature characteristic of them that distinguishes them from other undertakings, apart from the fact that they are capable of satisfying the conditions governing the application of the measure.\n\n29\n\n\nThe Commission submits that the General Court relies in that regard on an erroneous analysis of the case-law concerned.\n\n30\n\n\nWith respect to the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), the Commission argues that it is clear from paragraphs 90 and 91 of that judgment that that case concerned a particular situation in which the Court considered the reference tax system itself to be selective, in that it favoured ‘offshore’ undertakings as such, rather than any derogation from it. The reference made in that judgment to the ‘specific properties’ of a category of undertakings should therefore be understood as referring to the characteristics by reason of which those undertakings were favoured for tax purposes under a reference system that was inherently selective and cannot be extrapolated beyond that particular context.\n\n31\n\n\nAs regards paragraph 42 of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), the General Court failed to take into account the second sentence of that paragraph, which sets out the principle, enshrined in the Court’s settled case-law, that a measure is selective if it is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings, who are, in the light of the objective pursued by the scheme, in a comparable factual and legal situation.\n\n32\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa submit, first, that the Commission did not maintain, in the contested decisions, that the measure at issue was de facto selective, and, consequently, the present appeals are concerned only with examining the criticisms directed against the judgments under appeal to the effect that the General Court held that the grounds relied on by the Commission in those decisions did not support the conclusion that that measure was de jure selective.\n\n33\n\n\nThey contend that it follows from the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that a measure from which all undertakings can benefit cannot be considered to be selective. That judgment does not however permit the inference, as claimed by the Commission, that a national measure is not selective where it applies to all the undertakings in a Member State without exception, since, if that argument were valid, almost all tax rules would have to be considered to be selective.\n\n34\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa also dispute the Commission’s argument that national tax measures have on many occasions previously been classified as selective even though they set no minimum investment amount and applied regardless of the nature of the beneficiary’s activities. In any event, the measure at issue, in that it confers a tax advantage on any undertaking that wishes to benefit from it, irrespective of which category it falls into, for that reason alone cannot be deemed to be prima facie and de jure selective.\n\n35\n\n\nThe General Court was correct to rely on the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), since, in the decision that was at issue in that judgment, the Commission had expressly accepted that the national measure was not selective as regards the investors concerned, a position confirmed by the Court.\n\n36\n\n\nIn its decision-making practice, moreover, the Commission has on many occasions previously found tax measures not to be selective on the basis of the same criterion, in other words that general measures which are applicable to all undertakings without distinction and of which all taxable persons may take advantage are not selective.\n\n37\n\n\nWhat is more, the application of that criterion would not lead to a finding that measures relating to the purchase of certain assets as referred to by the Commission were not selective. Such measures could be classified as selective if it were shown that they do in fact benefit certain undertakings to the exclusion of others. In any event, their selectivity would follow not from the nature of the assets acquired but from the fact that it is legitimate to hold that the purchasers concerned form a particular category.\n\n38\n\n\nWith regard to the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa take the view that the General Court was right to consider that the measure at issue in the case which gave rise to that judgment differs from that in the present case, since it was intended to confer an advantage on a distinct and identifiable category of undertakings, that is to say those engaged in exporting.\n\n39\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa further submit that it follows clearly from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), and in particular paragraph 104 thereof, that a measure can be classified as selective only if it benefits a category of undertakings sharing ‘properties’ which are ‘specific’ to them. It follows moreover from that judgment that the identification of a derogation from an ordinary system is not an end in itself. All that matters is the actual effect of the measure, namely the fact that it does or does not benefit specific undertakings or the production of specific goods.\n\n40\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa argue that the interpretation of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), advocated by the Commission, can again not be accepted. First, in that judgment, the Court did not uphold the definition of a reference system and a derogation from that system. Second, that judgment does not permit a conclusion that a measure is selective by reason of the fact that the undertakings which satisfy the conditions to benefit from that measure form a distinct category.\n\n41\n\n\nLast, the General Court was correct to hold that a measure cannot be classified as selective, within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU, if the benefit of that measure depends on conduct that is prima facie open to any undertaking, irrespective of an undertaking’s sector of activity. That follows from the finding, in the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), that a national measure was not selective as regards investors.\n\n42\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain submits that the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598) confirms the position taken by the Spanish authorities during the administrative procedure before the Commission, to the effect that an economic advantage can be classified as aid only if it is capable of favouring ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n43\n\n\nIn the course of that administrative procedure, the Spanish authorities demonstrated that the measure at issue was generally accessible, on the ground that it was applied to undertakings active in very different business sectors, thereby supporting the analysis set out in the judgments under appeal and the fact that the Commission had failed in the contested decisions to demonstrate that that measure was selective.\n\n44\n\n\nIreland submits that, contrary to what is argued by the Commission, the General Court did not infer from the judgment of the Court of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), and the judgments of the General Court of 6 March 2002, Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission (T‑92/00 and T‑103/00, EU:T:2002:61), and of 9 September 2009, Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission (T‑227/01 to T‑229/01, T‑265/01, T‑266/01 and T‑270/01, EU:T:2009:315), that only measures the application of which was linked to the nature of the undertaking’s activities or the application of which was dependent on a minimum amount were selective, but held that selectivity could not be established with respect to a measure from which all undertakings resident for tax purposes in Spain and making acquisitions of at least 5% shareholdings in foreign undertakings could benefit, regardless of the nature of their activities and the amounts invested.\n\n45\n\n\nThe General Court was correct to rely on the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), in order to hold that it was necessary, if different tax treatment was to be classified as aid, that a particular category of undertakings capable of benefiting should be identified, by reason of their specific properties. The condition relating to selectivity as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU should moreover be defined in the same way in all cases concerning alleged State aid of a fiscal nature. Accordingly, the principle expressly stated in paragraph 104 of that judgment cannot be limited to a situation in which a tax system taken as a whole is selective.\n\n46\n\n\nIreland considers that measures such as the measure at issue, which do not a priori exclude any undertaking or any particular economic sector from the ambit of its recipients, cannot be regarded as being selective. The Commission has on several occasions previously relied on that ground in order to determine that certain national measures are not selective.\n\n47\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany submits that the existence, even if it were established, of a derogation from or exception to the reference framework identified by the Commission is not, in itself, sufficient to conclude that the measure at issue favours ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n48\n\n\nOn the contrary, it follows only that that measure is similar to a subsidy. Consequently, after an examination designed to determine that the measure has the nature of a derogation, it is appropriate, in accordance with the case-law and, in particular, the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), and as the General Court correctly held in the judgments under appeal, thereafter to determine whether the category of taxpayers favoured by a tax measure involves sufficiently specific undertakings or the production of sufficiently specific goods within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows accordingly from the Court’s case-law that the category of undertakings which receive a tax advantage is sufficiently specified where the Commission has been able to demonstrate that the advantage concerned was for the benefit of only undertakings belonging to a single economic sector and carrying out particular transactions (judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774), only undertakings that have a particular legal form (judgment of 10 January 2006, Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others, C‑222/04, EU:C:2006:8), only undertakings of a certain size (judgment of 13 February 2003, Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92) or only undertakings resident for tax purposes outside the territory of a region (judgment of 17 November 2009Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri, C‑169/08, EU:C:2009:709).\n\n50\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany recalls that the Court has previously held that a tax concession in favour of taxpayers who sell certain financial assets and can offset the resulting profit when they acquire other financial assets confers on them an advantage which, as a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators, cannot be classified as State aid (judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission, C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467, paragraph 22).\n\n51\n\n\nA fortiori, therefore, a tax measure such as that at issue, the application of which is generally linked to a certain category of transactions falling within the scope of company law, in this instance the acquisition of shareholdings, regardless of the object and business activities of the undertaking, should not be considered to be selective.\n\n52\n\n\nLast, the Member States intervening in these cases submit that, if the selectivity of a national measure as a condition for its classification as State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, were to be understood in the broad sense advocated by the Commission in its appeals, the consequence would be an undermining of the division of powers within the European Union. If such scope were to be conferred on the selectivity condition, the Commission could review almost all direct tax measures by virtue of its powers in the field of State aid, although direct taxation falls, as a general rule, within the legislative competence of the Member States.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n53\n\n\n First, it must be recalled that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, classification of a national measure as ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, requires all the following conditions to be fulfilled. First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources. Second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between the Member States. Third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient. Fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, inter alia, judgment of 16 July 2015, BVVG, C‑39/14, EU:C:2015:470, paragraph 24).\n\n54\n\n\nSo far as concerns the condition relating to the selectivity of the advantage, which is a constituent factor in the concept of ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, it is clear from equally settled case-law of the Court that  the assessment of that condition requires a determination whether, under a particular legal regime, a national measure is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation and who accordingly suffer different treatment that can, in essence, be classified as discriminatory  (see, inter alia, judgments of 28 July 2011, Mediaset v Commission, C‑403/10 P, not published, EU:C:2011:533, paragraph 36; of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 75 and 101; and of 14 January 2015, Eventech, C‑518/13, EU:C:2015:9, paragraphs 53 to 55; and of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C‑15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 59).\n\n55\n\n\nFurther, where the measure at issue is conceived as an aid scheme and not as individual aid, it is for the Commission to establish that that measure, although it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or certain sectors of activity (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraphs 49 and 50).\n\n56\n\n\nAs regards, in particular,  national measures that confer a tax advantage, it must be recalled that a measure of that nature which, although not involving the transfer of State resources, places the recipients in a more favourable position than other taxpayers is capable of procuring a selective advantage for the recipients and, consequently, of constituting State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.On the other hand, a tax advantage resulting from a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators does not constitute such aid  (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 18 July 2013, P,C‑6/12, EU:C:2013:525, paragraph 18).\n\n57\n\n\nIn that context, in order to classify a national tax measure as ‘selective’, the Commission must begin by identifying the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, and thereafter demonstrate that the tax measure at issue is a derogation from that ordinary system, in so far as it differentiates between operators who, in the light of the objective pursued by that ordinary tax system, are in a comparable factual and legal situation (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraph 49).\n\n58\n\n\nThe concept of ‘State aid’ does not, however, cover measures that differentiate between undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by the legal regime concerned, are in a comparable factual and legal situation, and are, therefore, a priori selective, where the Member State concerned is able to demonstrate that that differentiation is justified since it flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which the measures form part (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgments of 29 April 2004, Netherlands v Commission, C‑159/01, EU:C:2004:246, paragraphs 42 and 43; of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraphs 64 and 65; and of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 40).\n\n59\n\n\nFurther, it must be recalled that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for the application of a measure can benefit from the measure cannot, in itself, make it into a selective measure (judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 42).\n\n60\n\n\nIt follows from all the foregoing that  the appropriate criterion for establishing the selectivity of the measure at issue consists in determining whether that measure introduces, between operators that are, in the light of the objective pursued by the general tax system concerned, in a comparable factual and legal situation, a distinction that is not justified by the nature and general structure of that system  (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C‑15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 61).\n61\n\n\nThose are the factors that must guide the Court’s examination of whether, in this case, the General Court misconstrued Article 107(1) TFEU, as interpreted by the Court, by holding that the Commission had not, in the contested decisions, demonstrated to the requisite legal standard that the measure at issue conferred a selective advantage on ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’.\n\n62\n\n\nIn this case, the measure at issue confers a tax advantage that consists in a deduction from the taxable base for corporation tax in the form of an amortisation of the goodwill resulting from the acquisition by undertakings resident for tax purposes in Spain of at least 5% shareholdings in undertakings resident for tax purposes outside that Member State. That measure must, since it is capable of conferring an advantage on all such undertakings which carry out such transactions, be regarded as capable of constituting an aid scheme. It was therefore for the Commission to establish that that measure, notwithstanding that it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or on certain sectors of activity.\n\n63\n\n\nIn that regard, the General Court stated, in paragraph 50 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 54 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Commission, in order to establish that the measure at issue was selective, had primarily relied, in the contested decisions, on the ground that that measure constitutes a derogation from a reference system, in that the effect of that measure was the application to undertakings taxable in Spain, acquiring shareholdings in companies established outside Spain, of a tax treatment that differed from that applied to undertakings taxable in Spain making such acquisitions in companies established in Spain, although those two categories of undertakings were in comparable situations in the light of the objective pursued by that reference system, namely the general Spanish system for the taxation of companies and, more specifically, the rules relating to the tax treatment of financial goodwill within that tax system.\n\n64\n\n\nThe General Court held, in paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Commission had thereby applied the analytical method that may be deduced from the case-law of the Court and of the General Court cited, respectively, in paragraphs 29 to 33 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 33 to 37 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, which essentially corresponds to the Court’s case-law cited in paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment.\n\n65\n\n\nHowever, in paragraphs 44, 45, 52 and 53 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 48, 49, 56 and 57 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court held that the existence, were it to be established, of a derogation or an exception to the reference system identified by the Commission was not sufficient, in itself, to establish that the measure at issue favoured ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, since that measure was accessible, a priori, to any undertaking and it was directed not to a particular category of undertakings, which would have been the only undertakings favoured by that measure, but to a category of economic transactions.\n\n66\n\n\nIt is, however, clear that that reasoning is based on a misapplication of the selectivity condition laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU, as described in this judgment.\n\n67\n\n\nAs is apparent from paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment,  with respect to a national measure conferring a tax advantage of general application, such as the measure at issue, that condition is satisfied where the Commission is able to demonstrate that that measure is a derogation from the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, thereby introducing, through its actual effects, differences in the treatment of operators, although the operators who qualify for the tax advantage and those who do not are, in the light of the objective pursued by that Member State’s tax system, in a comparable factual and legal situation.\n\n68\n\n\nIt is apparent from the judgments under appeal that the Commission relied, in the contested decisions, in order to establish that the measure at issue was selective, on the fact that the consequence of that measure was that resident undertakings were not treated equally. Pursuant to that measure, only resident undertakings who acquired at least 5% shareholdings in foreign companies could, under certain conditions, qualify for the tax advantage at issue, whereas resident undertakings making the acquisition of such a shareholding in undertakings taxable in Spain could not obtain that advantage, notwithstanding the fact that, according to the Commission, they were in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary Spanish tax system.\n\n69\n\n\nHowever, the General Court considered that the measure at issue, on the grounds that it did not affect any particular category of undertakings or the production of any particular category of goods, that it was applicable regardless of the nature of an undertaking’s activity and that it was accessible, a priori or potentially, to all undertakings that wanted to acquire shareholdings of at least 5% in foreign companies and that held those shareholdings without interruption for at least one year, had to be regarded not as a selective measure but as a general measure within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 56 of this judgment. In so doing, the General Court erred in law.\n\n70\n\n\nThus, in paragraphs 41, 45, 67 and 68 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 45, 49, 71 and 72 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court held that, if the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure relevant to the recognition of State aid, in respect of a measure that is a priori accessible to any undertaking, is to be satisfied, it is always necessary that a particular category of undertakings, who are exclusively favoured by the measure concerned and who can be distinguished by reason of specific properties, common to them and characteristic of them, be identified.\n\n71\n\n\nHowever, the imposition of such a supplementary requirement to identify a particular category of undertakings, additional to the analytical method applicable to selectivity in tax matters that may be deduced from the Court’s settled case-law, which essentially involves ascertaining whether the exclusion of certain operators from the benefit of a tax advantage that arises from a measure derogating from an ordinary tax system constitutes discrimination with respect to those operators, cannot be inferred from the Court’s case-law and, in particular, from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732).\n\n72\n\n\nIt is true that, in paragraph 104 of that judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), the Court held that, in order to be capable of being recognised as conferring selective advantages, the criteria forming the basis of assessment which are adopted by a tax system must be such as to characterise the recipient undertakings, by virtue of properties which are specific to them, as a privileged category, thus permitting such a regime to be described as favouring ‘certain’ undertakings or the production of ‘certain’ goods, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n73\n\n\nHowever, that ground of the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), must be read in the context of the set of grounds of which it forms part, set out in paragraphs 87 to 108 of that judgment.\n\n74\n\n\nIt follows from a reading of all those grounds that the measure at issue in that judgment did not take the form of a tax advantage that derogated from an ordinary tax system, but rather involved the application of a ‘general’ tax scheme based on criteria that were, in themselves, also general. The Court held that the nature of that scheme did not preclude a finding that the measure concerned was selective, contrary to the ruling of the General Court, since the condition relating to selectivity has a broader scope that extends to measures which, by their effects, favour certain undertakings, in that case ‘offshore’ companies, on account of the specific features characteristic of those undertakings. That measure accordingly operated de facto discrimination against undertakings that were in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, in that case the objective of putting in place generalised taxation of all resident companies.\n\n75\n\n\nBy contrast, as stated above in paragraph 63 of this judgment, in the contested decisions, the Commission, in order to establish the selectivity of the measure at issue, relied primarily on the ground that the consequence of that measure is discrimination, in that it confers a tax advantage on certain resident undertakings and not on others who are subject to the same ordinary tax system from which the measure at issue is a derogation.\n\n76\n\n\nWhile it therefore follows from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), that the selectivity of a tax measure can be established even if that measure does not constitute a derogation from an ordinary tax system, but is an integral part of that system, the fact remains that that judgment is consistent with the Court’s settled case-law, cited in paragraph 57 of this judgment, to the effect that it is sufficient, in order to establish the selectivity of a measure that derogates from an ordinary tax system, to demonstrate that that measure benefits certain operators and not others, although all those operators are in an objectively comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary tax system.\n\n77\n\n\nIndeed, while it is not always necessary that a tax measure, in order for it to be established that it is selective, should derogate from an ordinary tax system, the fact that it can be so characterised is highly relevant in that regard where the effect of that measure is that two categories of operators are distinguished and are subject, a priori, to different treatment, namely those who fall within the scope of the derogating measure and those who continue to fall within the scope of the ordinary tax system, although those two categories are in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by that system.\n78\n\n\nContrary to what was held by the General Court in the judgments under appeal,  neither can it be required of the Commission, in order to establish the selectivity of such a measure, that it should identify certain specific features that are characteristic of and common to the undertakings that are the recipients of the tax advantage, by which they can be distinguished from those undertakings that are excluded from the advantage.\n\n79\n\n\nAll that matters in that regard is the fact that the measure, irrespective of its form or the legislative means used, should have the effect of placing the recipient undertakings in a position that is more favourable than that of other undertakings, although all those undertakings are in a comparable factual and legal situation in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned.\n80\n\n\nFurther, according to the Court’s settled case-law, the fact that the number of undertakings able to claim entitlement under a national measure is very large, or that those undertakings belong to various economic sectors, is not sufficient to call into question the selective nature of that measure and, therefore, to rule out its classification as State aid (see, inter alia, judgments of 13 February 2003, Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92, paragraph 48, and of 8 September 2011, Commission v Netherlands, C‑279/08 P, EU:C:2011:551, paragraph 50).\n\n81\n\n\nAccordingly, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraphs 53 to 58 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 57 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the potentially selective nature of the measure at issue is in no way called into question by the fact that the essential condition for obtaining the tax advantage conferred by that measure is that there should be an economic transaction, more particularly an ‘entirely financial’ transaction, for which no minimum investment is required and which is available regardless of the nature of the business of the recipient undertakings.\n\n82\n\n\nIn that context, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraph 57 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 61 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, it cannot be inferred from paragraph 36 of the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), according to which measures are not selective where they apply to all the undertakings in the national territory, ‘regardless of their activity’, that a measure whose application does not depend on the nature of the undertakings’ activity is, a priori, not selective.\n\n83\n\n\nIt is apparent from reading all the grounds of that judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer  Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that, in paragraph 36, read in the light of paragraph 35 of that judgment, the Court held that national measures, such as those at issue in that case, were not selective where they applied indiscriminately to all undertakings in the Member State concerned and constituted, for that reason, a general measure within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 56 of the present judgment.\n\n84\n\n\nIt must also be made clear that while the Court, in paragraph 36 of the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), referred to the activity of undertakings benefiting from the national measures, that reference is explained by the wording of the second question submitted by the referring court in the case that gave rise to that judgment.  That is confirmed by the fact that no such reference is made in the subsequent judgments of the Court which restate that principle (see, inter alia, judgments of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 73, and of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 39).\n\n85\n\n\nMoreover, it is true, as stated by the General Court in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Court held, in paragraph 42 of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for application of the measure concerned in that case could benefit from that measure could not, in itself, make it a selective measure. However, it must be noted that, in that same paragraph, the Court expressly stated that the absence of selectivity was due to the finding that persons who were not eligible for the measure concerned were not in a factual and legal situation comparable to that of taxpayers who were eligible, in the light of the objective pursued by the national legislature.\n\n86\n\n\nIt follows that a condition for the application or the receipt of tax aid may be grounds for a finding that that aid is selective, if that condition leads to a distinction being made between undertakings despite the fact that they are, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, in a comparable factual and legal situation, and if, therefore, it represents discrimination against undertakings which are excluded from it.\n\n87\n\n\nFurther, while, as stated by the General Court in the judgments under appeal,  the tax advantage conferred by the measure at issue can be obtained without any minimum investment requirement and without, consequently, the benefit of that measure being reserved to undertakings having sufficient financial resources, those factors do not preclude the possibility of that measure being classified as selective for other reasons, such as the fact that resident undertakings making acquisitions of shareholdings in companies resident for tax purposes in Spain could not obtain that advantage.\n\n88\n\n\nIn that regard, it may be added that the Court has previously ruled that a tax measure from which solely undertakings that carried out specified transactions benefited, and not undertakings in the same sector that did not carry out those transactions, could be classified as selective, there being no need to assess whether that measure was of greater benefit to large undertakings (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774, paragraphs 47 to 50).\n\n89\n\n\nContrary to the General Court’s assertion in paragraphs 59 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 63 to 66 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, no indication to the contrary as regards the analysis of the condition relating to the selectivity of a tax measure may be deduced from the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467).\n\n90\n\n\nIt follows from paragraphs 22 and 23 of the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), that, in the case that gave rise to that judgment, the Commission had classified the measure concerned as selective in relation to certain geographically defined undertakings in which private investors had reinvested the profits derived from sales of financial assets and not in relation to those investors themselves, with respect to whom the Commission had considered that that measure did not constitute aid, since, as a general measure, it benefited all operators indiscriminately, an assessment that was, moreover, not challenged before the Court and on which the Court therefore did not have to give a ruling.\n\n91\n\n\nIn any event, the situation of those private investors cannot be treated as equivalent to that of the resident undertakings that can benefit from the measure at issue.\n\n92\n\n\nIn the contested decisions,  the Commission, in order to classify the measure at issue as a selective measure, relied on the fact that the tax advantage conferred by that measure did not indiscriminately benefit all economic operators who were objectively in a comparable situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary Spanish tax system, since resident undertakings acquiring shareholdings of the same kind in companies resident for tax purposes in Spain could not obtain that advantage. The Commission then considered that the justification of that distinction between operators, relied on by the Kingdom of Spain, based on the nature or general structure of the system of which that measure formed part, could not be accepted.\n93\n\n\nIt follows from all the foregoing that the General Court erred in law, in annulling the contested decisions, in part, on the ground that the Commission had failed to define a particular category of undertakings favoured by the tax measure at issue, while omitting to determine whether the Commission, in applying the method of examination, described in paragraphs 29 to 33 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 33 to 37 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, which must be used in order to examine the condition relating to the selectivity of the measure at issue, had in fact analysed the question and had established that that measure was discriminatory.\n\n94\n\n\nWhile, indeed, that examination must be carried out rigorously and while sufficient reasons must be stated to permit full judicial review, in particular of the question whether the situation of operators benefiting from the measure is comparable with that of operators excluded from it and, where appropriate, of the justification for discrimination relied on by the Member State concerned, the fact remains that the General Court erred in law by not undertaking such a review, and by ruling, in the judgments under appeal, that the examination method applied by the Commission in the contested decisions, in failing to define a particular category of undertakings which were exclusively favoured by the tax measure at issue, was based on a misinterpretation of the condition relating to selectivity as laid down by Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n95\n\n\nConsequently, the first part of the Commission’s single ground of appeal is well founded.\n\nThe second part of the single ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n96\n\n\nBy the second part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law in applying the case-law relating to aid for exports and introduced an artificial distinction between aid for exports of goods and aid for exports of capital.\n\n97\n\n\nAs regards, first, the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law, in holding in paragraphs 69 to 76 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 73 to 80 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that that case-law concerns not the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure, but only the condition relating to the effect on competition and trade.\n\n98\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, it is apparent from the judgments cited in the preceding paragraph that the Court considered that the tax measures concerned were selective, on the ground that the benefit of them was reserved to undertakings that carried out transactions abroad, such as investments, and not to undertakings carrying out similar transactions domestically. The Commission maintains that it follows that any measure that is to the benefit of cross-border transactions, but excludes the same domestic transactions, is selective.\n\n99\n\n\nSecond, the Commission claims that General Court was wrong to introduce, in paragraphs 79 to 81 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 83 to 85 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, an artificial distinction between aid for exports and aid for export of capital in holding that it followed from the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), that ‘the category of recipient undertakings allowing a finding that the measure at issue was selective was made up of [exporting] undertakings’, a category bringing together undertakings which could be distinguished by reason of their common characteristics linked to their export activity.\n\n100\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, the undertakings affected by the measure at issue constitute a distinct category of undertakings, namely that of undertakings that export capital, since they share specific common characteristics linked to their activity of exporting capital.\n\n101\n\n\nThe Commission considers that, since, with respect to the condition relating to selectivity, there is no difference between the export of goods and the export of capital, the measure at issue was selective to the same degree as the measures concerned in the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions.\n\n102\n\n\nThe Commission maintains that a category of exporting undertakings does not exist, as something separate from the group of undertakings that carry out cross-border transactions. Any undertaking within a Member State can carry out a cross-border transaction and, thereby, qualify for an export aid scheme. The Commission considers that a national measure may become selective because of the advantage granted to the beneficiary of the measure, as a result of carrying out an export transaction, of goods, services or capital, and not by reason of the fact that the undertakings concerned are members of an alleged export sector.\n\n103\n\n\nAccordingly, as the Court ruled in the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), in a situation comparable to that in this case, the General Court ought to have held that the Commission had properly established the selectivity of the measure at issue by reason of the fact that the benefit of that measure was reserved to certain undertakings, namely those which were engaged in the activity of exporting capital.\n\n104\n\n\nLast, the approach adopted the General Court ignores the role and purpose of the body of State aid rules in relation to the protection of the internal market. That body of rules is intended in particular to ensure that Member States do not grant economic advantages specifically linked to the export of goods or capital. The act of specifically favouring exports of capital could give rise to distortions in the internal market in the same way as the act of specifically favouring exports of goods. \n\n105\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa contend that the General Court was correct to hold that the judgments of the Court relied on in the contested decisions concerned not the condition relating to selectivity, but the conditions relating to the effect on trade.\n\n106\n\n\nFurther, the General Court was correct to hold that, in the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Court considered that the measures concerned were selective, the principal ground being that the recipient undertakings shared certain characteristics, a factor that allowed the conclusion that those undertakings belonged to a particular sector of the economy, namely the export sector, more specifically the goods exporting sector. The measures at issue in the cases that gave rise those judgments favoured undertakings of which it was a characteristic feature that they exported a more or less significant part of their goods or services.\n\n107\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa argue that the measure at issue cannot, moreover, be considered to be selective on the ground that it applies to the category of undertakings described as ‘exporters of capital’.\n\n108\n\n\nSuch a category does not exist, and the Commission referred to it neither in the contested decisions nor before the General Court. That argument is inadmissible in an appeal, since it concerns a question of fact that is moreover raised out of time. It may be added that the argument contradicts the Commission’s main line of argument, that the Commission was not obliged to identify a category of undertakings that were affected by a measure in order to establish the selectivity of that measure.\n\n109\n\n\nIn any event, WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa contend that the selectivity of a national measure cannot be ascertained on the basis of characteristics such as the capital of an undertaking or its capacity to invest, since such characteristics are inherent in any undertaking.\n\n110\n\n\nIn addition, the rules governing the free movement of capital do not preclude a measure such as the measure at issue. While that measure involved different treatment that favours acquisitions of shareholdings abroad, that is at most reverse discrimination which is compatible with the fundamental freedoms.\n\n111\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain restates its position, previously argued in the administrative procedure before the Commission, that there is no economic activity that consists of exporting capital. The measure at issue does not favour certain undertakings or the production of certain goods since it is not concerned with the supply of goods and services on the market.\n\n112\n\n\nIreland maintains that the judgments relied on by the Commission in the contested decisions concerned measures which favoured a readily identifiable category of undertakings or the production of a readily identifiable category of goods, namely those involved in the export sector. However, there is no coherent category of undertakings that ‘export capital’, since any undertaking that makes an acquisition abroad ‘exports capital’.\n\n113\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany argues that the Commission’s submission in the alternative that the measure at issue is comparable to a measure granting aid for the export of goods and is therefore also aimed at the sufficiently delimited category of exporting undertakings has to be regarded as a retrospective addition of grounds to the contested decisions. The Federal Republic of Germany considers that that argument must be declared to be inadmissible on appeal.\n\n114\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany contends that the category of exporting undertakings at issue in the case-law relied on by the Commission in the contested decisions is distinct from other undertakings because of common characteristics linked to their exporting activity, which, in some cases, was connected to the making of specific investments.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n115\n\n\nAs regards the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), it is clear that, as stated, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 126 to 130 of his Opinion, the General Court erred in law, in holding, in paragraphs 69 to 76 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 73 to 80 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that that case-law did not concern the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure, but only the condition relating to the question whether competition and trade were affected.\n\n116\n\n\nIn paragraph 20 of the judgment of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), and in paragraph 8 of the judgment of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), the Court, in finding that there was State aid, necessarily held that all the conditions laid down on that subject in Article 107(1) TFEU, including the condition relating to selectivity, were satisfied. Further, in paragraph 120 of the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Court, referring, inter alia, to the two abovementioned judgments, expressly stated its position on the selectivity of the national measure under examination, holding that, in that case, selectivity followed from the fact that only undertakings engaged in export activities and carrying out certain investment transactions abroad qualified for the tax advantage conferred by that measure.\n\n117\n\n\nThe General Court also erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 77 to 82 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 81 to 86 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions had to be understood as meaning that the category of recipient undertakings with respect to whom the selectivity of export aid schemes must be examined was that constituted by ‘export undertakings’, which had to be defined as a category, which, while admittedly extremely broad, is nevertheless defined, comprising undertakings that could be distinguished by reason of specific, shared characteristics linked to their exporting activity.\n\n118\n\n\nAs observed, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 133 to 136 of his Opinion, that case-law cannot be understood as meaning that a national measure must necessarily be classified as selective where that measure benefits exclusively undertakings that export goods or services, even if, in fact, that may have been the case with respect to the particular tax measures at issue in the judgments concerned.\n\n119\n\n\nOn the contrary, taking into consideration the principles enshrined in the Court’s settled case-law, as set out above in paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment, which are entirely applicable to tax aid for exports, a measure such as the measure at issue, designed to facilitate exports, may be regarded as selective if it benefits undertakings carrying out cross-border transactions, in particular investment transactions, and is to the disadvantage of other undertakings which, while in a comparable factual and legal situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, carry out other transactions of the same kind within the national territory.\n\n120\n\n\nThat being the case, the second part of the single ground of appeal is also well founded.\n\n121\n\n\nConsequently, since both parts of the Commission’s single ground of appeal are well founded, the judgments under appeal must be set aside.\n\nThe actions before the General Court\n\n122\n\n\nIn accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, if the Court quashes the decision of the General Court, it may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n123\n\n\nThat is not the case here, since the General Court upheld the two actions for annulment but did not examine three of the four pleas in law relied on in each of those actions, pleas which only partly overlap, and did not examine, within its examination of the first pleas in law in those actions, whether those undertakings that did not meet the conditions for obtaining the tax advantage conferred by the measure at issue were, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, in a factual and legal situation comparable to that of the undertakings favoured by that measure. Further, examination of those pleas may involve assessment of matters of fact. The cases must therefore be referred back to the General Court.\n\nCosts\n\n124\n\n\nSince the cases are being referred back to the General Court, it is appropriate to reserve the costs.\n\n125\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain, as interveners, must bear their own costs.\n\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgments of the General Court of the European Union of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939), and of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938);\n\n\n2.\n\n\nRefers the cases back to the General Court of the European Union;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nReserves the costs;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain to bear their own costs\n"}

The measure at issue states that, to be classified as a ‘foreign company’, a company must be liable to pay a tax that is identical to the tax applicable in Spain and its income must derive mainly from business activities carried out abroad.\n\n6\n\n\nIn paragraphs 10 to 13 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission, which are identical to paragraphs 15 to 18 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court added the following:\n\n‘10\n\n\nIt follows from the [first] contested decision that, under Spanish law, a business combination is an operation whereby one or more companies, on being dissolved without going into liquidation, transfer all their assets and liabilities to another existing company or to a company that they form in exchange for the issue to their shareholders of securities representing the capital of that other company (recital 23 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 32 of the second contested decision]).\n\n11\n\n\nIn the [first] contested decision, share acquisition is to mean an operation whereby one company acquires a shareholding in the capital of another company without obtaining a majority or the control of the voting rights of the target company (recital 23 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 32 of the second contested decision]).\n\n12\n\n\nFurthermore, it is stated in the [first] contested decision that, according to the measure at issue, the financial goodwill is determined by deducting the market value of the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired company from the acquisition price paid for the shareholding. It is also stated that the concept of financial goodwill, as referred to in the measure at issue, introduces into the field of share acquisitions a concept that is usually used in transfers of assets or business combination transactions (recital 20 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 29 of the second contested decision]).\n\n13\n\n\nFinally, it should be noted that under Spanish tax law, the acquisition by an undertaking which is taxable in Spain of a shareholding in a company established in Spain does not allow the goodwill resulting from that acquisition to be recorded separately for tax purposes. However, again according to Spanish tax law, goodwill can be amortised [only in the case of] a business combination (recital 19 of the [first] contested decision[, identical to recital 28 of the second contested decision]).’\n\n7\n\n\nBy the first contested decision, the Commission concluded the procedure with respect to shareholding acquisitions within the European Union.\n\n8\n\n\nIn Article 1(1) of that decision, the Commission declared incompatible with the common market the scheme introduced by the measure at issue (‘the scheme at issue’), whereby a tax advantage was granted to undertakings taxable in Spain in order to enable them to amortise the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shareholdings in foreign undertakings, where it was applied to acquisitions of shareholdings in undertakings established within the European Union. In Article 4 of that decision, the Commission ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid granted under that scheme.\n\n9\n\n\nThe Commission maintained open, however, the procedure as regards acquisitions of shareholdings outside the European Union, the Spanish authorities having given an undertaking that they would provide further details concerning the obstacles to cross-border mergers outside the European Union.\n\n10\n\n\nBy the second contested decision, the Commission declared incompatible with the common market the scheme at issue, whereby a tax advantage was granted to undertakings taxable in Spain in order to enable them to amortise the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shareholdings in foreign undertakings, where it applied to acquisitions of shareholdings in undertakings established outside the European Union (Article 1(1) of that decision), and ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid granted under that scheme (Article 4 of that decision).\n\nThe procedure before the General Court and the judgments under appeal\n\n11\n\n\n By an application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 May 2010, Autogrill España SA, now World Duty Free Group SA (‘WDFG’), brought an action seeking the annulment of Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the first contested decision. \n\n12\n\n\nIn support of its action in so far as it is directed against Article 1(1) of that decision, WDFG relied on four pleas in law: (i) an error of law in the Commission’s application of the condition relating to selectivity; (ii) the measure at issue is not selective in so far as the differentiation that it introduces flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which it is part; (iii) the measure provides no advantage to companies to which the scheme at issue applies; and (iv) with respect to both the criterion relating to selectivity and that relating to the existence of an advantage, a failure to state adequate reasons for that decision.\n\n13\n\n\nBy an application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 29 July 2011,  Banco Santander SA and Santusa Holding SL (‘Santusa’) brought an action seeking the annulment of Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the second contested decision. \n\n14\n\n\nIn support of their action in so far as directed against Article 1(1) of that decision, Banco Santander and Santusa relied on five pleas in law: (i) an error of law in the Commission’s application of the condition relating to selectivity; (ii) an error in identifying the reference system; (iii) the measure at issue is not selective in so far as the differentiation that it introduces is a result of the nature or general structure of the system of which it is part; (iv) the measure provides no advantage to the companies to which the scheme at issue applies; and (v) with respect to both the criterion relating to selectivity and that relating to the existence of an advantage, a failure to state adequate reasons for the contested decision.\n\n15\n\n\nIn the judgments under appeal, the General Court, on essentially identical grounds, upheld the first plea of law in each of the two actions, namely that Article 107(1) TFEU had been misapplied with respect to the condition relating to selectivity, and consequently annulled Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the contested decisions, without examining the other pleas raised in those actions. \n\nForm of order sought by the parties and procedures before the Court\n\n16\n\n\nThe Commission claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgments under appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nrefer the respective cases back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\nreserve the costs. \n\n17\n\n\nWDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P, contend that the Court should dismiss the appeals, uphold the judgments under appeal and order the Commission to pay the costs.\n\n18\n\n\nBy decisions of the President of the Court of 19 May 2015, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain were granted leave to intervene in support of the forms of order sought by WDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and by Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P.\n\n19\n\n\nOn the other hand, by orders of the President of the Court of 6 October 2015, the applications of Telefónica SA and Iberdrola SA for leave to intervene in support of the forms of order sought by WDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and by Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P, were refused.\n\nThe appeals\n\n20\n\n\nIn support of its appeals, the Commission relies on a single ground of appeal, which has two parts, consisting of the claim that the General Court erred in law in the interpretation of the condition relating to selectivity as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU. \n\nThe first part of the single ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n21\n\n\nBy the first part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law by holding that the Commission was obliged, in order to demonstrate that a measure is selective, to identify a group of undertakings with specific characteristics.\n\n22\n\n\nThe Commission maintains that, in the contested decisions, it rigorously followed the method for the analysis of selectivity in tax matters, as that method is set out in the Court’s settled case-law. The Commission accordingly established that the measure at issue constituted a derogation from a reference system, in that the effect of the measure was that the tax treatment of undertakings taxable in Spain acquiring shareholdings of at least 5% in companies established outside Spain differed from that applicable to undertakings taxable in Spain making identical acquisitions in companies established in Spain, although those two categories of undertakings were in comparable situations in the light of the objective pursued by the general Spanish system for the taxation of companies.\n\n23\n\n\nThe Commission considers that the General Court, by imposing on it the additional obligation of demonstrating that the measure at issue favours certain undertakings capable of identification by reason of characteristics specific to them that other undertakings do not possess, in other words ex ante identifiable features that are characteristic of them, erred in law, since, in so doing, the General Court attributed a meaning to the condition relating to selectivity that is more restrictive than that defined by the Court.\n\n24\n\n\nThe Commission maintains, in particular, that, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraphs 57 and 58 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 61 and 62 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, measures can be classified as selective even if those measures are to be applied regardless of the nature of the activities of the beneficiary and create a tax advantage for certain investment transactions without setting a minimum investment amount.\n\n25\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, in that context, the General Court erred in inferring from the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that a national measure which is to be applied regardless of the nature of the activity of undertakings is not, a priori, selective. The statement in paragraph 36 of that judgment, that ‘national measures such as those at issue in the main proceedings do not constitute State aid … if they apply to all undertakings in national territory, regardless of their activity’ should be understood to mean that the reason why there is no selectivity is that the national measure applies indiscriminately to all undertakings in the Member State concerned.\n\n26\n\n\nThe Commission also claims that the General Court erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 59 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 63 to 66 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that a measure such as the measure at issue is not selective where it is linked to the purchase of particular financial assets, namely shareholdings in foreign companies, and where no category of undertakings is, a priori, excluded from benefiting from it.\n\n27\n\n\nThe Commission submits that the General Court wrongly relied in this regard on the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467). It follows from paragraphs 22 and 23 of that judgment that, in the case which gave rise to it, the Commission had classified the measure concerned as selective only in relation to certain geographically defined undertakings in which private investors had reinvested the profits from the sale of economic assets and not in relation to those investors themselves, for whom it had held that that measure did not constitute aid.\n\n28\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission criticises the General Court for having held, in paragraphs 66 to 68 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 70 to 72 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that it would be contrary to the case-law of the Court of Justice to regard as selective a national tax measure the benefit of which is subject to certain conditions, even though the beneficiary undertakings do not share any feature characteristic of them that distinguishes them from other undertakings, apart from the fact that they are capable of satisfying the conditions governing the application of the measure.\n\n29\n\n\nThe Commission submits that the General Court relies in that regard on an erroneous analysis of the case-law concerned.\n\n30\n\n\nWith respect to the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), the Commission argues that it is clear from paragraphs 90 and 91 of that judgment that that case concerned a particular situation in which the Court considered the reference tax system itself to be selective, in that it favoured ‘offshore’ undertakings as such, rather than any derogation from it. The reference made in that judgment to the ‘specific properties’ of a category of undertakings should therefore be understood as referring to the characteristics by reason of which those undertakings were favoured for tax purposes under a reference system that was inherently selective and cannot be extrapolated beyond that particular context.\n\n31\n\n\nAs regards paragraph 42 of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), the General Court failed to take into account the second sentence of that paragraph, which sets out the principle, enshrined in the Court’s settled case-law, that a measure is selective if it is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings, who are, in the light of the objective pursued by the scheme, in a comparable factual and legal situation.\n\n32\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa submit, first, that the Commission did not maintain, in the contested decisions, that the measure at issue was de facto selective, and, consequently, the present appeals are concerned only with examining the criticisms directed against the judgments under appeal to the effect that the General Court held that the grounds relied on by the Commission in those decisions did not support the conclusion that that measure was de jure selective.\n\n33\n\n\nThey contend that it follows from the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that a measure from which all undertakings can benefit cannot be considered to be selective. That judgment does not however permit the inference, as claimed by the Commission, that a national measure is not selective where it applies to all the undertakings in a Member State without exception, since, if that argument were valid, almost all tax rules would have to be considered to be selective.\n\n34\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa also dispute the Commission’s argument that national tax measures have on many occasions previously been classified as selective even though they set no minimum investment amount and applied regardless of the nature of the beneficiary’s activities. In any event, the measure at issue, in that it confers a tax advantage on any undertaking that wishes to benefit from it, irrespective of which category it falls into, for that reason alone cannot be deemed to be prima facie and de jure selective.\n\n35\n\n\nThe General Court was correct to rely on the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), since, in the decision that was at issue in that judgment, the Commission had expressly accepted that the national measure was not selective as regards the investors concerned, a position confirmed by the Court.\n\n36\n\n\nIn its decision-making practice, moreover, the Commission has on many occasions previously found tax measures not to be selective on the basis of the same criterion, in other words that general measures which are applicable to all undertakings without distinction and of which all taxable persons may take advantage are not selective.\n\n37\n\n\nWhat is more, the application of that criterion would not lead to a finding that measures relating to the purchase of certain assets as referred to by the Commission were not selective. Such measures could be classified as selective if it were shown that they do in fact benefit certain undertakings to the exclusion of others. In any event, their selectivity would follow not from the nature of the assets acquired but from the fact that it is legitimate to hold that the purchasers concerned form a particular category.\n\n38\n\n\nWith regard to the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa take the view that the General Court was right to consider that the measure at issue in the case which gave rise to that judgment differs from that in the present case, since it was intended to confer an advantage on a distinct and identifiable category of undertakings, that is to say those engaged in exporting.\n\n39\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa further submit that it follows clearly from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), and in particular paragraph 104 thereof, that a measure can be classified as selective only if it benefits a category of undertakings sharing ‘properties’ which are ‘specific’ to them. It follows moreover from that judgment that the identification of a derogation from an ordinary system is not an end in itself. All that matters is the actual effect of the measure, namely the fact that it does or does not benefit specific undertakings or the production of specific goods.\n\n40\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa argue that the interpretation of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), advocated by the Commission, can again not be accepted. First, in that judgment, the Court did not uphold the definition of a reference system and a derogation from that system. Second, that judgment does not permit a conclusion that a measure is selective by reason of the fact that the undertakings which satisfy the conditions to benefit from that measure form a distinct category.\n\n41\n\n\nLast, the General Court was correct to hold that a measure cannot be classified as selective, within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU, if the benefit of that measure depends on conduct that is prima facie open to any undertaking, irrespective of an undertaking’s sector of activity. That follows from the finding, in the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), that a national measure was not selective as regards investors.\n\n42\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain submits that the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598) confirms the position taken by the Spanish authorities during the administrative procedure before the Commission, to the effect that an economic advantage can be classified as aid only if it is capable of favouring ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n43\n\n\nIn the course of that administrative procedure, the Spanish authorities demonstrated that the measure at issue was generally accessible, on the ground that it was applied to undertakings active in very different business sectors, thereby supporting the analysis set out in the judgments under appeal and the fact that the Commission had failed in the contested decisions to demonstrate that that measure was selective.\n\n44\n\n\nIreland submits that, contrary to what is argued by the Commission, the General Court did not infer from the judgment of the Court of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), and the judgments of the General Court of 6 March 2002, Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission (T‑92/00 and T‑103/00, EU:T:2002:61), and of 9 September 2009, Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission (T‑227/01 to T‑229/01, T‑265/01, T‑266/01 and T‑270/01, EU:T:2009:315), that only measures the application of which was linked to the nature of the undertaking’s activities or the application of which was dependent on a minimum amount were selective, but held that selectivity could not be established with respect to a measure from which all undertakings resident for tax purposes in Spain and making acquisitions of at least 5% shareholdings in foreign undertakings could benefit, regardless of the nature of their activities and the amounts invested.\n\n45\n\n\nThe General Court was correct to rely on the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), in order to hold that it was necessary, if different tax treatment was to be classified as aid, that a particular category of undertakings capable of benefiting should be identified, by reason of their specific properties. The condition relating to selectivity as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU should moreover be defined in the same way in all cases concerning alleged State aid of a fiscal nature. Accordingly, the principle expressly stated in paragraph 104 of that judgment cannot be limited to a situation in which a tax system taken as a whole is selective.\n\n46\n\n\nIreland considers that measures such as the measure at issue, which do not a priori exclude any undertaking or any particular economic sector from the ambit of its recipients, cannot be regarded as being selective. The Commission has on several occasions previously relied on that ground in order to determine that certain national measures are not selective.\n\n47\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany submits that the existence, even if it were established, of a derogation from or exception to the reference framework identified by the Commission is not, in itself, sufficient to conclude that the measure at issue favours ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n48\n\n\nOn the contrary, it follows only that that measure is similar to a subsidy. Consequently, after an examination designed to determine that the measure has the nature of a derogation, it is appropriate, in accordance with the case-law and, in particular, the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), and as the General Court correctly held in the judgments under appeal, thereafter to determine whether the category of taxpayers favoured by a tax measure involves sufficiently specific undertakings or the production of sufficiently specific goods within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows accordingly from the Court’s case-law that the category of undertakings which receive a tax advantage is sufficiently specified where the Commission has been able to demonstrate that the advantage concerned was for the benefit of only undertakings belonging to a single economic sector and carrying out particular transactions (judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774), only undertakings that have a particular legal form (judgment of 10 January 2006, Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others, C‑222/04, EU:C:2006:8), only undertakings of a certain size (judgment of 13 February 2003, Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92) or only undertakings resident for tax purposes outside the territory of a region (judgment of 17 November 2009Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri, C‑169/08, EU:C:2009:709).\n\n50\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany recalls that the Court has previously held that a tax concession in favour of taxpayers who sell certain financial assets and can offset the resulting profit when they acquire other financial assets confers on them an advantage which, as a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators, cannot be classified as State aid (judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission, C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467, paragraph 22).\n\n51\n\n\nA fortiori, therefore, a tax measure such as that at issue, the application of which is generally linked to a certain category of transactions falling within the scope of company law, in this instance the acquisition of shareholdings, regardless of the object and business activities of the undertaking, should not be considered to be selective.\n\n52\n\n\nLast, the Member States intervening in these cases submit that, if the selectivity of a national measure as a condition for its classification as State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, were to be understood in the broad sense advocated by the Commission in its appeals, the consequence would be an undermining of the division of powers within the European Union. If such scope were to be conferred on the selectivity condition, the Commission could review almost all direct tax measures by virtue of its powers in the field of State aid, although direct taxation falls, as a general rule, within the legislative competence of the Member States.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n53\n\n\n First, it must be recalled that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, classification of a national measure as ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, requires all the following conditions to be fulfilled. First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources. Second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between the Member States. Third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient. Fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, inter alia, judgment of 16 July 2015, BVVG, C‑39/14, EU:C:2015:470, paragraph 24).\n\n54\n\n\nSo far as concerns the condition relating to the selectivity of the advantage, which is a constituent factor in the concept of ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, it is clear from equally settled case-law of the Court that  the assessment of that condition requires a determination whether, under a particular legal regime, a national measure is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation and who accordingly suffer different treatment that can, in essence, be classified as discriminatory  (see, inter alia, judgments of 28 July 2011, Mediaset v Commission, C‑403/10 P, not published, EU:C:2011:533, paragraph 36; of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 75 and 101; and of 14 January 2015, Eventech, C‑518/13, EU:C:2015:9, paragraphs 53 to 55; and of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C‑15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 59).\n\n55\n\n\nFurther, where the measure at issue is conceived as an aid scheme and not as individual aid, it is for the Commission to establish that that measure, although it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or certain sectors of activity (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraphs 49 and 50).\n\n56\n\n\nAs regards, in particular,  national measures that confer a tax advantage, it must be recalled that a measure of that nature which, although not involving the transfer of State resources, places the recipients in a more favourable position than other taxpayers is capable of procuring a selective advantage for the recipients and, consequently, of constituting State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.On the other hand, a tax advantage resulting from a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators does not constitute such aid  (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 18 July 2013, P,C‑6/12, EU:C:2013:525, paragraph 18).\n\n57\n\n\nIn that context, in order to classify a national tax measure as ‘selective’, the Commission must begin by identifying the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, and thereafter demonstrate that the tax measure at issue is a derogation from that ordinary system, in so far as it differentiates between operators who, in the light of the objective pursued by that ordinary tax system, are in a comparable factual and legal situation (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraph 49).\n\n58\n\n\nThe concept of ‘State aid’ does not, however, cover measures that differentiate between undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by the legal regime concerned, are in a comparable factual and legal situation, and are, therefore, a priori selective, where the Member State concerned is able to demonstrate that that differentiation is justified since it flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which the measures form part (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgments of 29 April 2004, Netherlands v Commission, C‑159/01, EU:C:2004:246, paragraphs 42 and 43; of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraphs 64 and 65; and of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 40).\n\n59\n\n\nFurther, it must be recalled that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for the application of a measure can benefit from the measure cannot, in itself, make it into a selective measure (judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 42).\n\n60\n\n\nIt follows from all the foregoing that  the appropriate criterion for establishing the selectivity of the measure at issue consists in determining whether that measure introduces, between operators that are, in the light of the objective pursued by the general tax system concerned, in a comparable factual and legal situation, a distinction that is not justified by the nature and general structure of that system  (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C‑15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 61).\n61\n\n\nThose are the factors that must guide the Court’s examination of whether, in this case, the General Court misconstrued Article 107(1) TFEU, as interpreted by the Court, by holding that the Commission had not, in the contested decisions, demonstrated to the requisite legal standard that the measure at issue conferred a selective advantage on ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’.\n\n62\n\n\nIn this case, the measure at issue confers a tax advantage that consists in a deduction from the taxable base for corporation tax in the form of an amortisation of the goodwill resulting from the acquisition by undertakings resident for tax purposes in Spain of at least 5% shareholdings in undertakings resident for tax purposes outside that Member State. That measure must, since it is capable of conferring an advantage on all such undertakings which carry out such transactions, be regarded as capable of constituting an aid scheme. It was therefore for the Commission to establish that that measure, notwithstanding that it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or on certain sectors of activity.\n\n63\n\n\nIn that regard, the General Court stated, in paragraph 50 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 54 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Commission, in order to establish that the measure at issue was selective, had primarily relied, in the contested decisions, on the ground that that measure constitutes a derogation from a reference system, in that the effect of that measure was the application to undertakings taxable in Spain, acquiring shareholdings in companies established outside Spain, of a tax treatment that differed from that applied to undertakings taxable in Spain making such acquisitions in companies established in Spain, although those two categories of undertakings were in comparable situations in the light of the objective pursued by that reference system, namely the general Spanish system for the taxation of companies and, more specifically, the rules relating to the tax treatment of financial goodwill within that tax system.\n\n64\n\n\nThe General Court held, in paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Commission had thereby applied the analytical method that may be deduced from the case-law of the Court and of the General Court cited, respectively, in paragraphs 29 to 33 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 33 to 37 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, which essentially corresponds to the Court’s case-law cited in paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment.\n\n65\n\n\nHowever, in paragraphs 44, 45, 52 and 53 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 48, 49, 56 and 57 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court held that the existence, were it to be established, of a derogation or an exception to the reference system identified by the Commission was not sufficient, in itself, to establish that the measure at issue favoured ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, since that measure was accessible, a priori, to any undertaking and it was directed not to a particular category of undertakings, which would have been the only undertakings favoured by that measure, but to a category of economic transactions.\n\n66\n\n\nIt is, however, clear that that reasoning is based on a misapplication of the selectivity condition laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU, as described in this judgment.\n\n67\n\n\nAs is apparent from paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment,  with respect to a national measure conferring a tax advantage of general application, such as the measure at issue, that condition is satisfied where the Commission is able to demonstrate that that measure is a derogation from the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, thereby introducing, through its actual effects, differences in the treatment of operators, although the operators who qualify for the tax advantage and those who do not are, in the light of the objective pursued by that Member State’s tax system, in a comparable factual and legal situation.\n\n68\n\n\nIt is apparent from the judgments under appeal that the Commission relied, in the contested decisions, in order to establish that the measure at issue was selective, on the fact that the consequence of that measure was that resident undertakings were not treated equally. Pursuant to that measure, only resident undertakings who acquired at least 5% shareholdings in foreign companies could, under certain conditions, qualify for the tax advantage at issue, whereas resident undertakings making the acquisition of such a shareholding in undertakings taxable in Spain could not obtain that advantage, notwithstanding the fact that, according to the Commission, they were in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary Spanish tax system.\n\n69\n\n\nHowever, the General Court considered that the measure at issue, on the grounds that it did not affect any particular category of undertakings or the production of any particular category of goods, that it was applicable regardless of the nature of an undertaking’s activity and that it was accessible, a priori or potentially, to all undertakings that wanted to acquire shareholdings of at least 5% in foreign companies and that held those shareholdings without interruption for at least one year, had to be regarded not as a selective measure but as a general measure within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 56 of this judgment. In so doing, the General Court erred in law.\n\n70\n\n\nThus, in paragraphs 41, 45, 67 and 68 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 45, 49, 71 and 72 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court held that, if the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure relevant to the recognition of State aid, in respect of a measure that is a priori accessible to any undertaking, is to be satisfied, it is always necessary that a particular category of undertakings, who are exclusively favoured by the measure concerned and who can be distinguished by reason of specific properties, common to them and characteristic of them, be identified.\n\n71\n\n\nHowever, the imposition of such a supplementary requirement to identify a particular category of undertakings, additional to the analytical method applicable to selectivity in tax matters that may be deduced from the Court’s settled case-law, which essentially involves ascertaining whether the exclusion of certain operators from the benefit of a tax advantage that arises from a measure derogating from an ordinary tax system constitutes discrimination with respect to those operators, cannot be inferred from the Court’s case-law and, in particular, from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732).\n\n72\n\n\nIt is true that, in paragraph 104 of that judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), the Court held that, in order to be capable of being recognised as conferring selective advantages, the criteria forming the basis of assessment which are adopted by a tax system must be such as to characterise the recipient undertakings, by virtue of properties which are specific to them, as a privileged category, thus permitting such a regime to be described as favouring ‘certain’ undertakings or the production of ‘certain’ goods, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n73\n\n\nHowever, that ground of the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), must be read in the context of the set of grounds of which it forms part, set out in paragraphs 87 to 108 of that judgment.\n\n74\n\n\nIt follows from a reading of all those grounds that the measure at issue in that judgment did not take the form of a tax advantage that derogated from an ordinary tax system, but rather involved the application of a ‘general’ tax scheme based on criteria that were, in themselves, also general. The Court held that the nature of that scheme did not preclude a finding that the measure concerned was selective, contrary to the ruling of the General Court, since the condition relating to selectivity has a broader scope that extends to measures which, by their effects, favour certain undertakings, in that case ‘offshore’ companies, on account of the specific features characteristic of those undertakings. That measure accordingly operated de facto discrimination against undertakings that were in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, in that case the objective of putting in place generalised taxation of all resident companies.\n\n75\n\n\nBy contrast, as stated above in paragraph 63 of this judgment, in the contested decisions, the Commission, in order to establish the selectivity of the measure at issue, relied primarily on the ground that the consequence of that measure is discrimination, in that it confers a tax advantage on certain resident undertakings and not on others who are subject to the same ordinary tax system from which the measure at issue is a derogation.\n\n76\n\n\nWhile it therefore follows from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), that the selectivity of a tax measure can be established even if that measure does not constitute a derogation from an ordinary tax system, but is an integral part of that system, the fact remains that that judgment is consistent with the Court’s settled case-law, cited in paragraph 57 of this judgment, to the effect that it is sufficient, in order to establish the selectivity of a measure that derogates from an ordinary tax system, to demonstrate that that measure benefits certain operators and not others, although all those operators are in an objectively comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary tax system.\n\n77\n\n\nIndeed, while it is not always necessary that a tax measure, in order for it to be established that it is selective, should derogate from an ordinary tax system, the fact that it can be so characterised is highly relevant in that regard where the effect of that measure is that two categories of operators are distinguished and are subject, a priori, to different treatment, namely those who fall within the scope of the derogating measure and those who continue to fall within the scope of the ordinary tax system, although those two categories are in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by that system.\n78\n\n\nContrary to what was held by the General Court in the judgments under appeal,  neither can it be required of the Commission, in order to establish the selectivity of such a measure, that it should identify certain specific features that are characteristic of and common to the undertakings that are the recipients of the tax advantage, by which they can be distinguished from those undertakings that are excluded from the advantage.\n\n79\n\n\nAll that matters in that regard is the fact that the measure, irrespective of its form or the legislative means used, should have the effect of placing the recipient undertakings in a position that is more favourable than that of other undertakings, although all those undertakings are in a comparable factual and legal situation in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned.\n80\n\n\nFurther, according to the Court’s settled case-law, the fact that the number of undertakings able to claim entitlement under a national measure is very large, or that those undertakings belong to various economic sectors, is not sufficient to call into question the selective nature of that measure and, therefore, to rule out its classification as State aid (see, inter alia, judgments of 13 February 2003, Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92, paragraph 48, and of 8 September 2011, Commission v Netherlands, C‑279/08 P, EU:C:2011:551, paragraph 50).\n\n81\n\n\nAccordingly, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraphs 53 to 58 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 57 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the potentially selective nature of the measure at issue is in no way called into question by the fact that the essential condition for obtaining the tax advantage conferred by that measure is that there should be an economic transaction, more particularly an ‘entirely financial’ transaction, for which no minimum investment is required and which is available regardless of the nature of the business of the recipient undertakings.\n\n82\n\n\nIn that context, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraph 57 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 61 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, it cannot be inferred from paragraph 36 of the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), according to which measures are not selective where they apply to all the undertakings in the national territory, ‘regardless of their activity’, that a measure whose application does not depend on the nature of the undertakings’ activity is, a priori, not selective.\n\n83\n\n\nIt is apparent from reading all the grounds of that judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer  Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that, in paragraph 36, read in the light of paragraph 35 of that judgment, the Court held that national measures, such as those at issue in that case, were not selective where they applied indiscriminately to all undertakings in the Member State concerned and constituted, for that reason, a general measure within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 56 of the present judgment.\n\n84\n\n\nIt must also be made clear that while the Court, in paragraph 36 of the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), referred to the activity of undertakings benefiting from the national measures, that reference is explained by the wording of the second question submitted by the referring court in the case that gave rise to that judgment.  That is confirmed by the fact that no such reference is made in the subsequent judgments of the Court which restate that principle (see, inter alia, judgments of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 73, and of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 39).\n\n85\n\n\nMoreover, it is true, as stated by the General Court in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Court held, in paragraph 42 of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for application of the measure concerned in that case could benefit from that measure could not, in itself, make it a selective measure. However, it must be noted that, in that same paragraph, the Court expressly stated that the absence of selectivity was due to the finding that persons who were not eligible for the measure concerned were not in a factual and legal situation comparable to that of taxpayers who were eligible, in the light of the objective pursued by the national legislature.\n\n86\n\n\nIt follows that a condition for the application or the receipt of tax aid may be grounds for a finding that that aid is selective, if that condition leads to a distinction being made between undertakings despite the fact that they are, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, in a comparable factual and legal situation, and if, therefore, it represents discrimination against undertakings which are excluded from it.\n\n87\n\n\nFurther, while, as stated by the General Court in the judgments under appeal,  the tax advantage conferred by the measure at issue can be obtained without any minimum investment requirement and without, consequently, the benefit of that measure being reserved to undertakings having sufficient financial resources, those factors do not preclude the possibility of that measure being classified as selective for other reasons, such as the fact that resident undertakings making acquisitions of shareholdings in companies resident for tax purposes in Spain could not obtain that advantage.\n\n88\n\n\nIn that regard, it may be added that the Court has previously ruled that a tax measure from which solely undertakings that carried out specified transactions benefited, and not undertakings in the same sector that did not carry out those transactions, could be classified as selective, there being no need to assess whether that measure was of greater benefit to large undertakings (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774, paragraphs 47 to 50).\n\n89\n\n\nContrary to the General Court’s assertion in paragraphs 59 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 63 to 66 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, no indication to the contrary as regards the analysis of the condition relating to the selectivity of a tax measure may be deduced from the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467).\n\n90\n\n\nIt follows from paragraphs 22 and 23 of the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), that, in the case that gave rise to that judgment, the Commission had classified the measure concerned as selective in relation to certain geographically defined undertakings in which private investors had reinvested the profits derived from sales of financial assets and not in relation to those investors themselves, with respect to whom the Commission had considered that that measure did not constitute aid, since, as a general measure, it benefited all operators indiscriminately, an assessment that was, moreover, not challenged before the Court and on which the Court therefore did not have to give a ruling.\n\n91\n\n\nIn any event, the situation of those private investors cannot be treated as equivalent to that of the resident undertakings that can benefit from the measure at issue.\n\n92\n\n\nIn the contested decisions,  the Commission, in order to classify the measure at issue as a selective measure, relied on the fact that the tax advantage conferred by that measure did not indiscriminately benefit all economic operators who were objectively in a comparable situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary Spanish tax system, since resident undertakings acquiring shareholdings of the same kind in companies resident for tax purposes in Spain could not obtain that advantage. The Commission then considered that the justification of that distinction between operators, relied on by the Kingdom of Spain, based on the nature or general structure of the system of which that measure formed part, could not be accepted.\n93\n\n\nIt follows from all the foregoing that the General Court erred in law, in annulling the contested decisions, in part, on the ground that the Commission had failed to define a particular category of undertakings favoured by the tax measure at issue, while omitting to determine whether the Commission, in applying the method of examination, described in paragraphs 29 to 33 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 33 to 37 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, which must be used in order to examine the condition relating to the selectivity of the measure at issue, had in fact analysed the question and had established that that measure was discriminatory.\n\n94\n\n\nWhile, indeed, that examination must be carried out rigorously and while sufficient reasons must be stated to permit full judicial review, in particular of the question whether the situation of operators benefiting from the measure is comparable with that of operators excluded from it and, where appropriate, of the justification for discrimination relied on by the Member State concerned, the fact remains that the General Court erred in law by not undertaking such a review, and by ruling, in the judgments under appeal, that the examination method applied by the Commission in the contested decisions, in failing to define a particular category of undertakings which were exclusively favoured by the tax measure at issue, was based on a misinterpretation of the condition relating to selectivity as laid down by Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n95\n\n\nConsequently, the first part of the Commission’s single ground of appeal is well founded.\n\nThe second part of the single ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n96\n\n\nBy the second part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law in applying the case-law relating to aid for exports and introduced an artificial distinction between aid for exports of goods and aid for exports of capital.\n\n97\n\n\nAs regards, first, the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law, in holding in paragraphs 69 to 76 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 73 to 80 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that that case-law concerns not the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure, but only the condition relating to the effect on competition and trade.\n\n98\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, it is apparent from the judgments cited in the preceding paragraph that the Court considered that the tax measures concerned were selective, on the ground that the benefit of them was reserved to undertakings that carried out transactions abroad, such as investments, and not to undertakings carrying out similar transactions domestically. The Commission maintains that it follows that any measure that is to the benefit of cross-border transactions, but excludes the same domestic transactions, is selective.\n\n99\n\n\nSecond, the Commission claims that General Court was wrong to introduce, in paragraphs 79 to 81 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 83 to 85 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, an artificial distinction between aid for exports and aid for export of capital in holding that it followed from the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), that ‘the category of recipient undertakings allowing a finding that the measure at issue was selective was made up of [exporting] undertakings’, a category bringing together undertakings which could be distinguished by reason of their common characteristics linked to their export activity.\n\n100\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, the undertakings affected by the measure at issue constitute a distinct category of undertakings, namely that of undertakings that export capital, since they share specific common characteristics linked to their activity of exporting capital.\n\n101\n\n\nThe Commission considers that, since, with respect to the condition relating to selectivity, there is no difference between the export of goods and the export of capital, the measure at issue was selective to the same degree as the measures concerned in the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions.\n\n102\n\n\nThe Commission maintains that a category of exporting undertakings does not exist, as something separate from the group of undertakings that carry out cross-border transactions. Any undertaking within a Member State can carry out a cross-border transaction and, thereby, qualify for an export aid scheme. The Commission considers that a national measure may become selective because of the advantage granted to the beneficiary of the measure, as a result of carrying out an export transaction, of goods, services or capital, and not by reason of the fact that the undertakings concerned are members of an alleged export sector.\n\n103\n\n\nAccordingly, as the Court ruled in the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), in a situation comparable to that in this case, the General Court ought to have held that the Commission had properly established the selectivity of the measure at issue by reason of the fact that the benefit of that measure was reserved to certain undertakings, namely those which were engaged in the activity of exporting capital.\n\n104\n\n\nLast, the approach adopted the General Court ignores the role and purpose of the body of State aid rules in relation to the protection of the internal market. That body of rules is intended in particular to ensure that Member States do not grant economic advantages specifically linked to the export of goods or capital. The act of specifically favouring exports of capital could give rise to distortions in the internal market in the same way as the act of specifically favouring exports of goods. \n\n105\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa contend that the General Court was correct to hold that the judgments of the Court relied on in the contested decisions concerned not the condition relating to selectivity, but the conditions relating to the effect on trade.\n\n106\n\n\nFurther, the General Court was correct to hold that, in the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Court considered that the measures concerned were selective, the principal ground being that the recipient undertakings shared certain characteristics, a factor that allowed the conclusion that those undertakings belonged to a particular sector of the economy, namely the export sector, more specifically the goods exporting sector. The measures at issue in the cases that gave rise those judgments favoured undertakings of which it was a characteristic feature that they exported a more or less significant part of their goods or services.\n\n107\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa argue that the measure at issue cannot, moreover, be considered to be selective on the ground that it applies to the category of undertakings described as ‘exporters of capital’.\n\n108\n\n\nSuch a category does not exist, and the Commission referred to it neither in the contested decisions nor before the General Court. That argument is inadmissible in an appeal, since it concerns a question of fact that is moreover raised out of time. It may be added that the argument contradicts the Commission’s main line of argument, that the Commission was not obliged to identify a category of undertakings that were affected by a measure in order to establish the selectivity of that measure.\n\n109\n\n\nIn any event, WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa contend that the selectivity of a national measure cannot be ascertained on the basis of characteristics such as the capital of an undertaking or its capacity to invest, since such characteristics are inherent in any undertaking.\n\n110\n\n\nIn addition, the rules governing the free movement of capital do not preclude a measure such as the measure at issue. While that measure involved different treatment that favours acquisitions of shareholdings abroad, that is at most reverse discrimination which is compatible with the fundamental freedoms.\n\n111\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain restates its position, previously argued in the administrative procedure before the Commission, that there is no economic activity that consists of exporting capital. The measure at issue does not favour certain undertakings or the production of certain goods since it is not concerned with the supply of goods and services on the market.\n\n112\n\n\nIreland maintains that the judgments relied on by the Commission in the contested decisions concerned measures which favoured a readily identifiable category of undertakings or the production of a readily identifiable category of goods, namely those involved in the export sector. However, there is no coherent category of undertakings that ‘export capital’, since any undertaking that makes an acquisition abroad ‘exports capital’.\n\n113\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany argues that the Commission’s submission in the alternative that the measure at issue is comparable to a measure granting aid for the export of goods and is therefore also aimed at the sufficiently delimited category of exporting undertakings has to be regarded as a retrospective addition of grounds to the contested decisions. The Federal Republic of Germany considers that that argument must be declared to be inadmissible on appeal.\n\n114\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany contends that the category of exporting undertakings at issue in the case-law relied on by the Commission in the contested decisions is distinct from other undertakings because of common characteristics linked to their exporting activity, which, in some cases, was connected to the making of specific investments.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n115\n\n\nAs regards the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), it is clear that, as stated, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 126 to 130 of his Opinion, the General Court erred in law, in holding, in paragraphs 69 to 76 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 73 to 80 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that that case-law did not concern the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure, but only the condition relating to the question whether competition and trade were affected.\n\n116\n\n\nIn paragraph 20 of the judgment of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), and in paragraph 8 of the judgment of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), the Court, in finding that there was State aid, necessarily held that all the conditions laid down on that subject in Article 107(1) TFEU, including the condition relating to selectivity, were satisfied. Further, in paragraph 120 of the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Court, referring, inter alia, to the two abovementioned judgments, expressly stated its position on the selectivity of the national measure under examination, holding that, in that case, selectivity followed from the fact that only undertakings engaged in export activities and carrying out certain investment transactions abroad qualified for the tax advantage conferred by that measure.\n\n117\n\n\nThe General Court also erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 77 to 82 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 81 to 86 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions had to be understood as meaning that the category of recipient undertakings with respect to whom the selectivity of export aid schemes must be examined was that constituted by ‘export undertakings’, which had to be defined as a category, which, while admittedly extremely broad, is nevertheless defined, comprising undertakings that could be distinguished by reason of specific, shared characteristics linked to their exporting activity.\n\n118\n\n\nAs observed, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 133 to 136 of his Opinion, that case-law cannot be understood as meaning that a national measure must necessarily be classified as selective where that measure benefits exclusively undertakings that export goods or services, even if, in fact, that may have been the case with respect to the particular tax measures at issue in the judgments concerned.\n\n119\n\n\nOn the contrary, taking into consideration the principles enshrined in the Court’s settled case-law, as set out above in paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment, which are entirely applicable to tax aid for exports, a measure such as the measure at issue, designed to facilitate exports, may be regarded as selective if it benefits undertakings carrying out cross-border transactions, in particular investment transactions, and is to the disadvantage of other undertakings which, while in a comparable factual and legal situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, carry out other transactions of the same kind within the national territory.\n\n120\n\n\nThat being the case, the second part of the single ground of appeal is also well founded.\n\n121\n\n\nConsequently, since both parts of the Commission’s single ground of appeal are well founded, the judgments under appeal must be set aside.\n\nThe actions before the General Court\n\n122\n\n\nIn accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, if the Court quashes the decision of the General Court, it may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n123\n\n\nThat is not the case here, since the General Court upheld the two actions for annulment but did not examine three of the four pleas in law relied on in each of those actions, pleas which only partly overlap, and did not examine, within its examination of the first pleas in law in those actions, whether those undertakings that did not meet the conditions for obtaining the tax advantage conferred by the measure at issue were, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, in a factual and legal situation comparable to that of the undertakings favoured by that measure. Further, examination of those pleas may involve assessment of matters of fact. The cases must therefore be referred back to the General Court.\n\nCosts\n\n124\n\n\nSince the cases are being referred back to the General Court, it is appropriate to reserve the costs.\n\n125\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain, as interveners, must bear their own costs.\n\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgments of the General Court of the European Union of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939), and of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938);\n\n\n2.\n\n\nRefers the cases back to the General Court of the European Union;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nReserves the costs;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain to bear their own costs\n"}

The measure at issue states that, to be classified as a ‘foreign company’, a company must be liable to pay a tax that is identical to the tax applicable in Spain and its income must derive mainly from business activities carried out abroad.\n\n6\n\n\nIn paragraphs 10 to 13 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission, which are identical to paragraphs 15 to 18 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court added the following:\n\n‘10\n\n\nIt follows from the [first] contested decision that, under Spanish law, a business combination is an operation whereby one or more companies, on being dissolved without going into liquidation, transfer all their assets and liabilities to another existing company or to a company that they form in exchange for the issue to their shareholders of securities representing the capital of that other company (recital 23 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 32 of the second contested decision]).\n\n11\n\n\nIn the [first] contested decision, share acquisition is to mean an operation whereby one company acquires a shareholding in the capital of another company without obtaining a majority or the control of the voting rights of the target company (recital 23 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 32 of the second contested decision]).\n\n12\n\n\nFurthermore, it is stated in the [first] contested decision that, according to the measure at issue, the financial goodwill is determined by deducting the market value of the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired company from the acquisition price paid for the shareholding. It is also stated that the concept of financial goodwill, as referred to in the measure at issue, introduces into the field of share acquisitions a concept that is usually used in transfers of assets or business combination transactions (recital 20 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 29 of the second contested decision]).\n\n13\n\n\nFinally, it should be noted that under Spanish tax law, the acquisition by an undertaking which is taxable in Spain of a shareholding in a company established in Spain does not allow the goodwill resulting from that acquisition to be recorded separately for tax purposes. However, again according to Spanish tax law, goodwill can be amortised [only in the case of] a business combination (recital 19 of the [first] contested decision[, identical to recital 28 of the second contested decision]).’\n\n7\n\n\nBy the first contested decision, the Commission concluded the procedure with respect to shareholding acquisitions within the European Union.\n\n8\n\n\nIn Article 1(1) of that decision, the Commission declared incompatible with the common market the scheme introduced by the measure at issue (‘the scheme at issue’), whereby a tax advantage was granted to undertakings taxable in Spain in order to enable them to amortise the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shareholdings in foreign undertakings, where it was applied to acquisitions of shareholdings in undertakings established within the European Union. In Article 4 of that decision, the Commission ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid granted under that scheme.\n\n9\n\n\nThe Commission maintained open, however, the procedure as regards acquisitions of shareholdings outside the European Union, the Spanish authorities having given an undertaking that they would provide further details concerning the obstacles to cross-border mergers outside the European Union.\n\n10\n\n\nBy the second contested decision, the Commission declared incompatible with the common market the scheme at issue, whereby a tax advantage was granted to undertakings taxable in Spain in order to enable them to amortise the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shareholdings in foreign undertakings, where it applied to acquisitions of shareholdings in undertakings established outside the European Union (Article 1(1) of that decision), and ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid granted under that scheme (Article 4 of that decision).\n\nThe procedure before the General Court and the judgments under appeal\n\n11\n\n\n By an application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 May 2010, Autogrill España SA, now World Duty Free Group SA (‘WDFG’), brought an action seeking the annulment of Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the first contested decision. \n\n12\n\n\nIn support of its action in so far as it is directed against Article 1(1) of that decision, WDFG relied on four pleas in law: (i) an error of law in the Commission’s application of the condition relating to selectivity; (ii) the measure at issue is not selective in so far as the differentiation that it introduces flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which it is part; (iii) the measure provides no advantage to companies to which the scheme at issue applies; and (iv) with respect to both the criterion relating to selectivity and that relating to the existence of an advantage, a failure to state adequate reasons for that decision.\n\n13\n\n\nBy an application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 29 July 2011,  Banco Santander SA and Santusa Holding SL (‘Santusa’) brought an action seeking the annulment of Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the second contested decision. \n\n14\n\n\nIn support of their action in so far as directed against Article 1(1) of that decision, Banco Santander and Santusa relied on five pleas in law: (i) an error of law in the Commission’s application of the condition relating to selectivity; (ii) an error in identifying the reference system; (iii) the measure at issue is not selective in so far as the differentiation that it introduces is a result of the nature or general structure of the system of which it is part; (iv) the measure provides no advantage to the companies to which the scheme at issue applies; and (v) with respect to both the criterion relating to selectivity and that relating to the existence of an advantage, a failure to state adequate reasons for the contested decision.\n\n15\n\n\nIn the judgments under appeal, the General Court, on essentially identical grounds, upheld the first plea of law in each of the two actions, namely that Article 107(1) TFEU had been misapplied with respect to the condition relating to selectivity, and consequently annulled Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the contested decisions, without examining the other pleas raised in those actions. \n\nForm of order sought by the parties and procedures before the Court\n\n16\n\n\nThe Commission claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgments under appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nrefer the respective cases back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\nreserve the costs. \n\n17\n\n\nWDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P, contend that the Court should dismiss the appeals, uphold the judgments under appeal and order the Commission to pay the costs.\n\n18\n\n\nBy decisions of the President of the Court of 19 May 2015, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain were granted leave to intervene in support of the forms of order sought by WDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and by Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P.\n\n19\n\n\nOn the other hand, by orders of the President of the Court of 6 October 2015, the applications of Telefónica SA and Iberdrola SA for leave to intervene in support of the forms of order sought by WDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and by Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P, were refused.\n\nThe appeals\n\n20\n\n\nIn support of its appeals, the Commission relies on a single ground of appeal, which has two parts, consisting of the claim that the General Court erred in law in the interpretation of the condition relating to selectivity as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU. \n\nThe first part of the single ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n21\n\n\nBy the first part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law by holding that the Commission was obliged, in order to demonstrate that a measure is selective, to identify a group of undertakings with specific characteristics.\n\n22\n\n\nThe Commission maintains that, in the contested decisions, it rigorously followed the method for the analysis of selectivity in tax matters, as that method is set out in the Court’s settled case-law. The Commission accordingly established that the measure at issue constituted a derogation from a reference system, in that the effect of the measure was that the tax treatment of undertakings taxable in Spain acquiring shareholdings of at least 5% in companies established outside Spain differed from that applicable to undertakings taxable in Spain making identical acquisitions in companies established in Spain, although those two categories of undertakings were in comparable situations in the light of the objective pursued by the general Spanish system for the taxation of companies.\n\n23\n\n\nThe Commission considers that the General Court, by imposing on it the additional obligation of demonstrating that the measure at issue favours certain undertakings capable of identification by reason of characteristics specific to them that other undertakings do not possess, in other words ex ante identifiable features that are characteristic of them, erred in law, since, in so doing, the General Court attributed a meaning to the condition relating to selectivity that is more restrictive than that defined by the Court.\n\n24\n\n\nThe Commission maintains, in particular, that, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraphs 57 and 58 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 61 and 62 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, measures can be classified as selective even if those measures are to be applied regardless of the nature of the activities of the beneficiary and create a tax advantage for certain investment transactions without setting a minimum investment amount.\n\n25\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, in that context, the General Court erred in inferring from the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that a national measure which is to be applied regardless of the nature of the activity of undertakings is not, a priori, selective. The statement in paragraph 36 of that judgment, that ‘national measures such as those at issue in the main proceedings do not constitute State aid … if they apply to all undertakings in national territory, regardless of their activity’ should be understood to mean that the reason why there is no selectivity is that the national measure applies indiscriminately to all undertakings in the Member State concerned.\n\n26\n\n\nThe Commission also claims that the General Court erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 59 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 63 to 66 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that a measure such as the measure at issue is not selective where it is linked to the purchase of particular financial assets, namely shareholdings in foreign companies, and where no category of undertakings is, a priori, excluded from benefiting from it.\n\n27\n\n\nThe Commission submits that the General Court wrongly relied in this regard on the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467). It follows from paragraphs 22 and 23 of that judgment that, in the case which gave rise to it, the Commission had classified the measure concerned as selective only in relation to certain geographically defined undertakings in which private investors had reinvested the profits from the sale of economic assets and not in relation to those investors themselves, for whom it had held that that measure did not constitute aid.\n\n28\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission criticises the General Court for having held, in paragraphs 66 to 68 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 70 to 72 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that it would be contrary to the case-law of the Court of Justice to regard as selective a national tax measure the benefit of which is subject to certain conditions, even though the beneficiary undertakings do not share any feature characteristic of them that distinguishes them from other undertakings, apart from the fact that they are capable of satisfying the conditions governing the application of the measure.\n\n29\n\n\nThe Commission submits that the General Court relies in that regard on an erroneous analysis of the case-law concerned.\n\n30\n\n\nWith respect to the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), the Commission argues that it is clear from paragraphs 90 and 91 of that judgment that that case concerned a particular situation in which the Court considered the reference tax system itself to be selective, in that it favoured ‘offshore’ undertakings as such, rather than any derogation from it. The reference made in that judgment to the ‘specific properties’ of a category of undertakings should therefore be understood as referring to the characteristics by reason of which those undertakings were favoured for tax purposes under a reference system that was inherently selective and cannot be extrapolated beyond that particular context.\n\n31\n\n\nAs regards paragraph 42 of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), the General Court failed to take into account the second sentence of that paragraph, which sets out the principle, enshrined in the Court’s settled case-law, that a measure is selective if it is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings, who are, in the light of the objective pursued by the scheme, in a comparable factual and legal situation.\n\n32\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa submit, first, that the Commission did not maintain, in the contested decisions, that the measure at issue was de facto selective, and, consequently, the present appeals are concerned only with examining the criticisms directed against the judgments under appeal to the effect that the General Court held that the grounds relied on by the Commission in those decisions did not support the conclusion that that measure was de jure selective.\n\n33\n\n\nThey contend that it follows from the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that a measure from which all undertakings can benefit cannot be considered to be selective. That judgment does not however permit the inference, as claimed by the Commission, that a national measure is not selective where it applies to all the undertakings in a Member State without exception, since, if that argument were valid, almost all tax rules would have to be considered to be selective.\n\n34\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa also dispute the Commission’s argument that national tax measures have on many occasions previously been classified as selective even though they set no minimum investment amount and applied regardless of the nature of the beneficiary’s activities. In any event, the measure at issue, in that it confers a tax advantage on any undertaking that wishes to benefit from it, irrespective of which category it falls into, for that reason alone cannot be deemed to be prima facie and de jure selective.\n\n35\n\n\nThe General Court was correct to rely on the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), since, in the decision that was at issue in that judgment, the Commission had expressly accepted that the national measure was not selective as regards the investors concerned, a position confirmed by the Court.\n\n36\n\n\nIn its decision-making practice, moreover, the Commission has on many occasions previously found tax measures not to be selective on the basis of the same criterion, in other words that general measures which are applicable to all undertakings without distinction and of which all taxable persons may take advantage are not selective.\n\n37\n\n\nWhat is more, the application of that criterion would not lead to a finding that measures relating to the purchase of certain assets as referred to by the Commission were not selective. Such measures could be classified as selective if it were shown that they do in fact benefit certain undertakings to the exclusion of others. In any event, their selectivity would follow not from the nature of the assets acquired but from the fact that it is legitimate to hold that the purchasers concerned form a particular category.\n\n38\n\n\nWith regard to the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa take the view that the General Court was right to consider that the measure at issue in the case which gave rise to that judgment differs from that in the present case, since it was intended to confer an advantage on a distinct and identifiable category of undertakings, that is to say those engaged in exporting.\n\n39\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa further submit that it follows clearly from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), and in particular paragraph 104 thereof, that a measure can be classified as selective only if it benefits a category of undertakings sharing ‘properties’ which are ‘specific’ to them. It follows moreover from that judgment that the identification of a derogation from an ordinary system is not an end in itself. All that matters is the actual effect of the measure, namely the fact that it does or does not benefit specific undertakings or the production of specific goods.\n\n40\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa argue that the interpretation of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), advocated by the Commission, can again not be accepted. First, in that judgment, the Court did not uphold the definition of a reference system and a derogation from that system. Second, that judgment does not permit a conclusion that a measure is selective by reason of the fact that the undertakings which satisfy the conditions to benefit from that measure form a distinct category.\n\n41\n\n\nLast, the General Court was correct to hold that a measure cannot be classified as selective, within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU, if the benefit of that measure depends on conduct that is prima facie open to any undertaking, irrespective of an undertaking’s sector of activity. That follows from the finding, in the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), that a national measure was not selective as regards investors.\n\n42\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain submits that the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598) confirms the position taken by the Spanish authorities during the administrative procedure before the Commission, to the effect that an economic advantage can be classified as aid only if it is capable of favouring ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n43\n\n\nIn the course of that administrative procedure, the Spanish authorities demonstrated that the measure at issue was generally accessible, on the ground that it was applied to undertakings active in very different business sectors, thereby supporting the analysis set out in the judgments under appeal and the fact that the Commission had failed in the contested decisions to demonstrate that that measure was selective.\n\n44\n\n\nIreland submits that, contrary to what is argued by the Commission, the General Court did not infer from the judgment of the Court of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), and the judgments of the General Court of 6 March 2002, Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission (T‑92/00 and T‑103/00, EU:T:2002:61), and of 9 September 2009, Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission (T‑227/01 to T‑229/01, T‑265/01, T‑266/01 and T‑270/01, EU:T:2009:315), that only measures the application of which was linked to the nature of the undertaking’s activities or the application of which was dependent on a minimum amount were selective, but held that selectivity could not be established with respect to a measure from which all undertakings resident for tax purposes in Spain and making acquisitions of at least 5% shareholdings in foreign undertakings could benefit, regardless of the nature of their activities and the amounts invested.\n\n45\n\n\nThe General Court was correct to rely on the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), in order to hold that it was necessary, if different tax treatment was to be classified as aid, that a particular category of undertakings capable of benefiting should be identified, by reason of their specific properties. The condition relating to selectivity as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU should moreover be defined in the same way in all cases concerning alleged State aid of a fiscal nature. Accordingly, the principle expressly stated in paragraph 104 of that judgment cannot be limited to a situation in which a tax system taken as a whole is selective.\n\n46\n\n\nIreland considers that measures such as the measure at issue, which do not a priori exclude any undertaking or any particular economic sector from the ambit of its recipients, cannot be regarded as being selective. The Commission has on several occasions previously relied on that ground in order to determine that certain national measures are not selective.\n\n47\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany submits that the existence, even if it were established, of a derogation from or exception to the reference framework identified by the Commission is not, in itself, sufficient to conclude that the measure at issue favours ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n48\n\n\nOn the contrary, it follows only that that measure is similar to a subsidy. Consequently, after an examination designed to determine that the measure has the nature of a derogation, it is appropriate, in accordance with the case-law and, in particular, the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), and as the General Court correctly held in the judgments under appeal, thereafter to determine whether the category of taxpayers favoured by a tax measure involves sufficiently specific undertakings or the production of sufficiently specific goods within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows accordingly from the Court’s case-law that the category of undertakings which receive a tax advantage is sufficiently specified where the Commission has been able to demonstrate that the advantage concerned was for the benefit of only undertakings belonging to a single economic sector and carrying out particular transactions (judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774), only undertakings that have a particular legal form (judgment of 10 January 2006, Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others, C‑222/04, EU:C:2006:8), only undertakings of a certain size (judgment of 13 February 2003, Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92) or only undertakings resident for tax purposes outside the territory of a region (judgment of 17 November 2009Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri, C‑169/08, EU:C:2009:709).\n\n50\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany recalls that the Court has previously held that a tax concession in favour of taxpayers who sell certain financial assets and can offset the resulting profit when they acquire other financial assets confers on them an advantage which, as a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators, cannot be classified as State aid (judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission, C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467, paragraph 22).\n\n51\n\n\nA fortiori, therefore, a tax measure such as that at issue, the application of which is generally linked to a certain category of transactions falling within the scope of company law, in this instance the acquisition of shareholdings, regardless of the object and business activities of the undertaking, should not be considered to be selective.\n\n52\n\n\nLast, the Member States intervening in these cases submit that, if the selectivity of a national measure as a condition for its classification as State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, were to be understood in the broad sense advocated by the Commission in its appeals, the consequence would be an undermining of the division of powers within the European Union. If such scope were to be conferred on the selectivity condition, the Commission could review almost all direct tax measures by virtue of its powers in the field of State aid, although direct taxation falls, as a general rule, within the legislative competence of the Member States.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n53\n\n\n First, it must be recalled that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, classification of a national measure as ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, requires all the following conditions to be fulfilled. First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources. Second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between the Member States. Third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient. Fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, inter alia, judgment of 16 July 2015, BVVG, C‑39/14, EU:C:2015:470, paragraph 24).\n\n54\n\n\nSo far as concerns the condition relating to the selectivity of the advantage, which is a constituent factor in the concept of ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, it is clear from equally settled case-law of the Court that  the assessment of that condition requires a determination whether, under a particular legal regime, a national measure is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation and who accordingly suffer different treatment that can, in essence, be classified as discriminatory  (see, inter alia, judgments of 28 July 2011, Mediaset v Commission, C‑403/10 P, not published, EU:C:2011:533, paragraph 36; of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 75 and 101; and of 14 January 2015, Eventech, C‑518/13, EU:C:2015:9, paragraphs 53 to 55; and of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C‑15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 59).\n\n55\n\n\nFurther, where the measure at issue is conceived as an aid scheme and not as individual aid, it is for the Commission to establish that that measure, although it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or certain sectors of activity (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraphs 49 and 50).\n\n56\n\n\nAs regards, in particular,  national measures that confer a tax advantage, it must be recalled that a measure of that nature which, although not involving the transfer of State resources, places the recipients in a more favourable position than other taxpayers is capable of procuring a selective advantage for the recipients and, consequently, of constituting State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.On the other hand, a tax advantage resulting from a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators does not constitute such aid  (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 18 July 2013, P,C‑6/12, EU:C:2013:525, paragraph 18).\n\n57\n\n\nIn that context, in order to classify a national tax measure as ‘selective’, the Commission must begin by identifying the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, and thereafter demonstrate that the tax measure at issue is a derogation from that ordinary system, in so far as it differentiates between operators who, in the light of the objective pursued by that ordinary tax system, are in a comparable factual and legal situation (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraph 49).\n\n58\n\n\nThe concept of ‘State aid’ does not, however, cover measures that differentiate between undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by the legal regime concerned, are in a comparable factual and legal situation, and are, therefore, a priori selective, where the Member State concerned is able to demonstrate that that differentiation is justified since it flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which the measures form part (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgments of 29 April 2004, Netherlands v Commission, C‑159/01, EU:C:2004:246, paragraphs 42 and 43; of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraphs 64 and 65; and of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 40).\n\n59\n\n\nFurther, it must be recalled that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for the application of a measure can benefit from the measure cannot, in itself, make it into a selective measure (judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 42).\n\n60\n\n\nIt follows from all the foregoing that  the appropriate criterion for establishing the selectivity of the measure at issue consists in determining whether that measure introduces, between operators that are, in the light of the objective pursued by the general tax system concerned, in a comparable factual and legal situation, a distinction that is not justified by the nature and general structure of that system  (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C‑15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 61).\n61\n\n\nThose are the factors that must guide the Court’s examination of whether, in this case, the General Court misconstrued Article 107(1) TFEU, as interpreted by the Court, by holding that the Commission had not, in the contested decisions, demonstrated to the requisite legal standard that the measure at issue conferred a selective advantage on ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’.\n\n62\n\n\nIn this case, the measure at issue confers a tax advantage that consists in a deduction from the taxable base for corporation tax in the form of an amortisation of the goodwill resulting from the acquisition by undertakings resident for tax purposes in Spain of at least 5% shareholdings in undertakings resident for tax purposes outside that Member State. That measure must, since it is capable of conferring an advantage on all such undertakings which carry out such transactions, be regarded as capable of constituting an aid scheme. It was therefore for the Commission to establish that that measure, notwithstanding that it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or on certain sectors of activity.\n\n63\n\n\nIn that regard, the General Court stated, in paragraph 50 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 54 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Commission, in order to establish that the measure at issue was selective, had primarily relied, in the contested decisions, on the ground that that measure constitutes a derogation from a reference system, in that the effect of that measure was the application to undertakings taxable in Spain, acquiring shareholdings in companies established outside Spain, of a tax treatment that differed from that applied to undertakings taxable in Spain making such acquisitions in companies established in Spain, although those two categories of undertakings were in comparable situations in the light of the objective pursued by that reference system, namely the general Spanish system for the taxation of companies and, more specifically, the rules relating to the tax treatment of financial goodwill within that tax system.\n\n64\n\n\nThe General Court held, in paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Commission had thereby applied the analytical method that may be deduced from the case-law of the Court and of the General Court cited, respectively, in paragraphs 29 to 33 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 33 to 37 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, which essentially corresponds to the Court’s case-law cited in paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment.\n\n65\n\n\nHowever, in paragraphs 44, 45, 52 and 53 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 48, 49, 56 and 57 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court held that the existence, were it to be established, of a derogation or an exception to the reference system identified by the Commission was not sufficient, in itself, to establish that the measure at issue favoured ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, since that measure was accessible, a priori, to any undertaking and it was directed not to a particular category of undertakings, which would have been the only undertakings favoured by that measure, but to a category of economic transactions.\n\n66\n\n\nIt is, however, clear that that reasoning is based on a misapplication of the selectivity condition laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU, as described in this judgment.\n\n67\n\n\nAs is apparent from paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment,  with respect to a national measure conferring a tax advantage of general application, such as the measure at issue, that condition is satisfied where the Commission is able to demonstrate that that measure is a derogation from the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, thereby introducing, through its actual effects, differences in the treatment of operators, although the operators who qualify for the tax advantage and those who do not are, in the light of the objective pursued by that Member State’s tax system, in a comparable factual and legal situation.\n\n68\n\n\nIt is apparent from the judgments under appeal that the Commission relied, in the contested decisions, in order to establish that the measure at issue was selective, on the fact that the consequence of that measure was that resident undertakings were not treated equally. Pursuant to that measure, only resident undertakings who acquired at least 5% shareholdings in foreign companies could, under certain conditions, qualify for the tax advantage at issue, whereas resident undertakings making the acquisition of such a shareholding in undertakings taxable in Spain could not obtain that advantage, notwithstanding the fact that, according to the Commission, they were in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary Spanish tax system.\n\n69\n\n\nHowever, the General Court considered that the measure at issue, on the grounds that it did not affect any particular category of undertakings or the production of any particular category of goods, that it was applicable regardless of the nature of an undertaking’s activity and that it was accessible, a priori or potentially, to all undertakings that wanted to acquire shareholdings of at least 5% in foreign companies and that held those shareholdings without interruption for at least one year, had to be regarded not as a selective measure but as a general measure within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 56 of this judgment. In so doing, the General Court erred in law.\n\n70\n\n\nThus, in paragraphs 41, 45, 67 and 68 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 45, 49, 71 and 72 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court held that, if the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure relevant to the recognition of State aid, in respect of a measure that is a priori accessible to any undertaking, is to be satisfied, it is always necessary that a particular category of undertakings, who are exclusively favoured by the measure concerned and who can be distinguished by reason of specific properties, common to them and characteristic of them, be identified.\n\n71\n\n\nHowever, the imposition of such a supplementary requirement to identify a particular category of undertakings, additional to the analytical method applicable to selectivity in tax matters that may be deduced from the Court’s settled case-law, which essentially involves ascertaining whether the exclusion of certain operators from the benefit of a tax advantage that arises from a measure derogating from an ordinary tax system constitutes discrimination with respect to those operators, cannot be inferred from the Court’s case-law and, in particular, from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732).\n\n72\n\n\nIt is true that, in paragraph 104 of that judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), the Court held that, in order to be capable of being recognised as conferring selective advantages, the criteria forming the basis of assessment which are adopted by a tax system must be such as to characterise the recipient undertakings, by virtue of properties which are specific to them, as a privileged category, thus permitting such a regime to be described as favouring ‘certain’ undertakings or the production of ‘certain’ goods, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n73\n\n\nHowever, that ground of the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), must be read in the context of the set of grounds of which it forms part, set out in paragraphs 87 to 108 of that judgment.\n\n74\n\n\nIt follows from a reading of all those grounds that the measure at issue in that judgment did not take the form of a tax advantage that derogated from an ordinary tax system, but rather involved the application of a ‘general’ tax scheme based on criteria that were, in themselves, also general. The Court held that the nature of that scheme did not preclude a finding that the measure concerned was selective, contrary to the ruling of the General Court, since the condition relating to selectivity has a broader scope that extends to measures which, by their effects, favour certain undertakings, in that case ‘offshore’ companies, on account of the specific features characteristic of those undertakings. That measure accordingly operated de facto discrimination against undertakings that were in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, in that case the objective of putting in place generalised taxation of all resident companies.\n\n75\n\n\nBy contrast, as stated above in paragraph 63 of this judgment, in the contested decisions, the Commission, in order to establish the selectivity of the measure at issue, relied primarily on the ground that the consequence of that measure is discrimination, in that it confers a tax advantage on certain resident undertakings and not on others who are subject to the same ordinary tax system from which the measure at issue is a derogation.\n\n76\n\n\nWhile it therefore follows from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), that the selectivity of a tax measure can be established even if that measure does not constitute a derogation from an ordinary tax system, but is an integral part of that system, the fact remains that that judgment is consistent with the Court’s settled case-law, cited in paragraph 57 of this judgment, to the effect that it is sufficient, in order to establish the selectivity of a measure that derogates from an ordinary tax system, to demonstrate that that measure benefits certain operators and not others, although all those operators are in an objectively comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary tax system.\n\n77\n\n\nIndeed, while it is not always necessary that a tax measure, in order for it to be established that it is selective, should derogate from an ordinary tax system, the fact that it can be so characterised is highly relevant in that regard where the effect of that measure is that two categories of operators are distinguished and are subject, a priori, to different treatment, namely those who fall within the scope of the derogating measure and those who continue to fall within the scope of the ordinary tax system, although those two categories are in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by that system.\n78\n\n\nContrary to what was held by the General Court in the judgments under appeal,  neither can it be required of the Commission, in order to establish the selectivity of such a measure, that it should identify certain specific features that are characteristic of and common to the undertakings that are the recipients of the tax advantage, by which they can be distinguished from those undertakings that are excluded from the advantage.\n\n79\n\n\nAll that matters in that regard is the fact that the measure, irrespective of its form or the legislative means used, should have the effect of placing the recipient undertakings in a position that is more favourable than that of other undertakings, although all those undertakings are in a comparable factual and legal situation in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned.\n80\n\n\nFurther, according to the Court’s settled case-law, the fact that the number of undertakings able to claim entitlement under a national measure is very large, or that those undertakings belong to various economic sectors, is not sufficient to call into question the selective nature of that measure and, therefore, to rule out its classification as State aid (see, inter alia, judgments of 13 February 2003, Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92, paragraph 48, and of 8 September 2011, Commission v Netherlands, C‑279/08 P, EU:C:2011:551, paragraph 50).\n\n81\n\n\nAccordingly, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraphs 53 to 58 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 57 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the potentially selective nature of the measure at issue is in no way called into question by the fact that the essential condition for obtaining the tax advantage conferred by that measure is that there should be an economic transaction, more particularly an ‘entirely financial’ transaction, for which no minimum investment is required and which is available regardless of the nature of the business of the recipient undertakings.\n\n82\n\n\nIn that context, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraph 57 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 61 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, it cannot be inferred from paragraph 36 of the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), according to which measures are not selective where they apply to all the undertakings in the national territory, ‘regardless of their activity’, that a measure whose application does not depend on the nature of the undertakings’ activity is, a priori, not selective.\n\n83\n\n\nIt is apparent from reading all the grounds of that judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer  Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that, in paragraph 36, read in the light of paragraph 35 of that judgment, the Court held that national measures, such as those at issue in that case, were not selective where they applied indiscriminately to all undertakings in the Member State concerned and constituted, for that reason, a general measure within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 56 of the present judgment.\n\n84\n\n\nIt must also be made clear that while the Court, in paragraph 36 of the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), referred to the activity of undertakings benefiting from the national measures, that reference is explained by the wording of the second question submitted by the referring court in the case that gave rise to that judgment.  That is confirmed by the fact that no such reference is made in the subsequent judgments of the Court which restate that principle (see, inter alia, judgments of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 73, and of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 39).\n\n85\n\n\nMoreover, it is true, as stated by the General Court in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Court held, in paragraph 42 of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for application of the measure concerned in that case could benefit from that measure could not, in itself, make it a selective measure. However, it must be noted that, in that same paragraph, the Court expressly stated that the absence of selectivity was due to the finding that persons who were not eligible for the measure concerned were not in a factual and legal situation comparable to that of taxpayers who were eligible, in the light of the objective pursued by the national legislature.\n\n86\n\n\nIt follows that a condition for the application or the receipt of tax aid may be grounds for a finding that that aid is selective, if that condition leads to a distinction being made between undertakings despite the fact that they are, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, in a comparable factual and legal situation, and if, therefore, it represents discrimination against undertakings which are excluded from it.\n\n87\n\n\nFurther, while, as stated by the General Court in the judgments under appeal,  the tax advantage conferred by the measure at issue can be obtained without any minimum investment requirement and without, consequently, the benefit of that measure being reserved to undertakings having sufficient financial resources, those factors do not preclude the possibility of that measure being classified as selective for other reasons, such as the fact that resident undertakings making acquisitions of shareholdings in companies resident for tax purposes in Spain could not obtain that advantage.\n\n88\n\n\nIn that regard, it may be added that the Court has previously ruled that a tax measure from which solely undertakings that carried out specified transactions benefited, and not undertakings in the same sector that did not carry out those transactions, could be classified as selective, there being no need to assess whether that measure was of greater benefit to large undertakings (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774, paragraphs 47 to 50).\n\n89\n\n\nContrary to the General Court’s assertion in paragraphs 59 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 63 to 66 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, no indication to the contrary as regards the analysis of the condition relating to the selectivity of a tax measure may be deduced from the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467).\n\n90\n\n\nIt follows from paragraphs 22 and 23 of the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), that, in the case that gave rise to that judgment, the Commission had classified the measure concerned as selective in relation to certain geographically defined undertakings in which private investors had reinvested the profits derived from sales of financial assets and not in relation to those investors themselves, with respect to whom the Commission had considered that that measure did not constitute aid, since, as a general measure, it benefited all operators indiscriminately, an assessment that was, moreover, not challenged before the Court and on which the Court therefore did not have to give a ruling.\n\n91\n\n\nIn any event, the situation of those private investors cannot be treated as equivalent to that of the resident undertakings that can benefit from the measure at issue.\n\n92\n\n\nIn the contested decisions,  the Commission, in order to classify the measure at issue as a selective measure, relied on the fact that the tax advantage conferred by that measure did not indiscriminately benefit all economic operators who were objectively in a comparable situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary Spanish tax system, since resident undertakings acquiring shareholdings of the same kind in companies resident for tax purposes in Spain could not obtain that advantage. The Commission then considered that the justification of that distinction between operators, relied on by the Kingdom of Spain, based on the nature or general structure of the system of which that measure formed part, could not be accepted.\n93\n\n\nIt follows from all the foregoing that the General Court erred in law, in annulling the contested decisions, in part, on the ground that the Commission had failed to define a particular category of undertakings favoured by the tax measure at issue, while omitting to determine whether the Commission, in applying the method of examination, described in paragraphs 29 to 33 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 33 to 37 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, which must be used in order to examine the condition relating to the selectivity of the measure at issue, had in fact analysed the question and had established that that measure was discriminatory.\n\n94\n\n\nWhile, indeed, that examination must be carried out rigorously and while sufficient reasons must be stated to permit full judicial review, in particular of the question whether the situation of operators benefiting from the measure is comparable with that of operators excluded from it and, where appropriate, of the justification for discrimination relied on by the Member State concerned, the fact remains that the General Court erred in law by not undertaking such a review, and by ruling, in the judgments under appeal, that the examination method applied by the Commission in the contested decisions, in failing to define a particular category of undertakings which were exclusively favoured by the tax measure at issue, was based on a misinterpretation of the condition relating to selectivity as laid down by Article 107(1) TFEU.\n\n95\n\n\nConsequently, the first part of the Commission’s single ground of appeal is well founded.\n\nThe second part of the single ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n96\n\n\nBy the second part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law in applying the case-law relating to aid for exports and introduced an artificial distinction between aid for exports of goods and aid for exports of capital.\n\n97\n\n\nAs regards, first, the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law, in holding in paragraphs 69 to 76 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 73 to 80 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that that case-law concerns not the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure, but only the condition relating to the effect on competition and trade.\n\n98\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, it is apparent from the judgments cited in the preceding paragraph that the Court considered that the tax measures concerned were selective, on the ground that the benefit of them was reserved to undertakings that carried out transactions abroad, such as investments, and not to undertakings carrying out similar transactions domestically. The Commission maintains that it follows that any measure that is to the benefit of cross-border transactions, but excludes the same domestic transactions, is selective.\n\n99\n\n\nSecond, the Commission claims that General Court was wrong to introduce, in paragraphs 79 to 81 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 83 to 85 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, an artificial distinction between aid for exports and aid for export of capital in holding that it followed from the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), that ‘the category of recipient undertakings allowing a finding that the measure at issue was selective was made up of [exporting] undertakings’, a category bringing together undertakings which could be distinguished by reason of their common characteristics linked to their export activity.\n\n100\n\n\nAccording to the Commission, the undertakings affected by the measure at issue constitute a distinct category of undertakings, namely that of undertakings that export capital, since they share specific common characteristics linked to their activity of exporting capital.\n\n101\n\n\nThe Commission considers that, since, with respect to the condition relating to selectivity, there is no difference between the export of goods and the export of capital, the measure at issue was selective to the same degree as the measures concerned in the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions.\n\n102\n\n\nThe Commission maintains that a category of exporting undertakings does not exist, as something separate from the group of undertakings that carry out cross-border transactions. Any undertaking within a Member State can carry out a cross-border transaction and, thereby, qualify for an export aid scheme. The Commission considers that a national measure may become selective because of the advantage granted to the beneficiary of the measure, as a result of carrying out an export transaction, of goods, services or capital, and not by reason of the fact that the undertakings concerned are members of an alleged export sector.\n\n103\n\n\nAccordingly, as the Court ruled in the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), in a situation comparable to that in this case, the General Court ought to have held that the Commission had properly established the selectivity of the measure at issue by reason of the fact that the benefit of that measure was reserved to certain undertakings, namely those which were engaged in the activity of exporting capital.\n\n104\n\n\nLast, the approach adopted the General Court ignores the role and purpose of the body of State aid rules in relation to the protection of the internal market. That body of rules is intended in particular to ensure that Member States do not grant economic advantages specifically linked to the export of goods or capital. The act of specifically favouring exports of capital could give rise to distortions in the internal market in the same way as the act of specifically favouring exports of goods. \n\n105\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa contend that the General Court was correct to hold that the judgments of the Court relied on in the contested decisions concerned not the condition relating to selectivity, but the conditions relating to the effect on trade.\n\n106\n\n\nFurther, the General Court was correct to hold that, in the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Court considered that the measures concerned were selective, the principal ground being that the recipient undertakings shared certain characteristics, a factor that allowed the conclusion that those undertakings belonged to a particular sector of the economy, namely the export sector, more specifically the goods exporting sector. The measures at issue in the cases that gave rise those judgments favoured undertakings of which it was a characteristic feature that they exported a more or less significant part of their goods or services.\n\n107\n\n\nWDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa argue that the measure at issue cannot, moreover, be considered to be selective on the ground that it applies to the category of undertakings described as ‘exporters of capital’.\n\n108\n\n\nSuch a category does not exist, and the Commission referred to it neither in the contested decisions nor before the General Court. That argument is inadmissible in an appeal, since it concerns a question of fact that is moreover raised out of time. It may be added that the argument contradicts the Commission’s main line of argument, that the Commission was not obliged to identify a category of undertakings that were affected by a measure in order to establish the selectivity of that measure.\n\n109\n\n\nIn any event, WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa contend that the selectivity of a national measure cannot be ascertained on the basis of characteristics such as the capital of an undertaking or its capacity to invest, since such characteristics are inherent in any undertaking.\n\n110\n\n\nIn addition, the rules governing the free movement of capital do not preclude a measure such as the measure at issue. While that measure involved different treatment that favours acquisitions of shareholdings abroad, that is at most reverse discrimination which is compatible with the fundamental freedoms.\n\n111\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain restates its position, previously argued in the administrative procedure before the Commission, that there is no economic activity that consists of exporting capital. The measure at issue does not favour certain undertakings or the production of certain goods since it is not concerned with the supply of goods and services on the market.\n\n112\n\n\nIreland maintains that the judgments relied on by the Commission in the contested decisions concerned measures which favoured a readily identifiable category of undertakings or the production of a readily identifiable category of goods, namely those involved in the export sector. However, there is no coherent category of undertakings that ‘export capital’, since any undertaking that makes an acquisition abroad ‘exports capital’.\n\n113\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany argues that the Commission’s submission in the alternative that the measure at issue is comparable to a measure granting aid for the export of goods and is therefore also aimed at the sufficiently delimited category of exporting undertakings has to be regarded as a retrospective addition of grounds to the contested decisions. The Federal Republic of Germany considers that that argument must be declared to be inadmissible on appeal.\n\n114\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany contends that the category of exporting undertakings at issue in the case-law relied on by the Commission in the contested decisions is distinct from other undertakings because of common characteristics linked to their exporting activity, which, in some cases, was connected to the making of specific investments.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n115\n\n\nAs regards the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), it is clear that, as stated, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 126 to 130 of his Opinion, the General Court erred in law, in holding, in paragraphs 69 to 76 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 73 to 80 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that that case-law did not concern the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure, but only the condition relating to the question whether competition and trade were affected.\n\n116\n\n\nIn paragraph 20 of the judgment of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), and in paragraph 8 of the judgment of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), the Court, in finding that there was State aid, necessarily held that all the conditions laid down on that subject in Article 107(1) TFEU, including the condition relating to selectivity, were satisfied. Further, in paragraph 120 of the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Court, referring, inter alia, to the two abovementioned judgments, expressly stated its position on the selectivity of the national measure under examination, holding that, in that case, selectivity followed from the fact that only undertakings engaged in export activities and carrying out certain investment transactions abroad qualified for the tax advantage conferred by that measure.\n\n117\n\n\nThe General Court also erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 77 to 82 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 81 to 86 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions had to be understood as meaning that the category of recipient undertakings with respect to whom the selectivity of export aid schemes must be examined was that constituted by ‘export undertakings’, which had to be defined as a category, which, while admittedly extremely broad, is nevertheless defined, comprising undertakings that could be distinguished by reason of specific, shared characteristics linked to their exporting activity.\n\n118\n\n\nAs observed, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 133 to 136 of his Opinion, that case-law cannot be understood as meaning that a national measure must necessarily be classified as selective where that measure benefits exclusively undertakings that export goods or services, even if, in fact, that may have been the case with respect to the particular tax measures at issue in the judgments concerned.\n\n119\n\n\nOn the contrary, taking into consideration the principles enshrined in the Court’s settled case-law, as set out above in paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment, which are entirely applicable to tax aid for exports, a measure such as the measure at issue, designed to facilitate exports, may be regarded as selective if it benefits undertakings carrying out cross-border transactions, in particular investment transactions, and is to the disadvantage of other undertakings which, while in a comparable factual and legal situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, carry out other transactions of the same kind within the national territory.\n\n120\n\n\nThat being the case, the second part of the single ground of appeal is also well founded.\n\n121\n\n\nConsequently, since both parts of the Commission’s single ground of appeal are well founded, the judgments under appeal must be set aside.\n\nThe actions before the General Court\n\n122\n\n\nIn accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, if the Court quashes the decision of the General Court, it may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n123\n\n\nThat is not the case here, since the General Court upheld the two actions for annulment but did not examine three of the four pleas in law relied on in each of those actions, pleas which only partly overlap, and did not examine, within its examination of the first pleas in law in those actions, whether those undertakings that did not meet the conditions for obtaining the tax advantage conferred by the measure at issue were, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, in a factual and legal situation comparable to that of the undertakings favoured by that measure. Further, examination of those pleas may involve assessment of matters of fact. The cases must therefore be referred back to the General Court.\n\nCosts\n\n124\n\n\nSince the cases are being referred back to the General Court, it is appropriate to reserve the costs.\n\n125\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain, as interveners, must bear their own costs.\n\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgments of the General Court of the European Union of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939), and of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938);\n\n\n2.\n\n\nRefers the cases back to the General Court of the European Union;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nReserves the costs;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain to bear their own costs\n"}

Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs.

Levits (Rapporteur), Judges, \n\nAdvocate General: M. Wathelet,\n\nRegistrar: A. Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Levits (Rapporteur), Judges, \n\nAdvocate General: M. Wathelet,\n\nRegistrar: A. Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Levits (Rapporteur), Judges, \n\nAdvocate General: M. Wathelet,\n\nRegistrar: A. Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Levits (Rapporteur), Judges, \n\nAdvocate General: M. Wathelet,\n\nRegistrar: A. Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Levits (Rapporteur), Judges, \n\nAdvocate General: M. Wathelet,\n\nRegistrar: A. Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\nhaving decided, after hearing the Advocate General, to proceed to judgment without an Opinion,\n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’). \n\n Background to the dispute and the decision at issue\n\n2\n\n\nUntil 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines. Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.\n\n3\n\n\nArticle 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million. Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks. In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months. Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.\n\n4\n\n\nIn addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.\n\n5\n\n\nAfter having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities. By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU. In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.\n\n6\n\n\nBy the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it. By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue. The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million. \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n7\n\n\n In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim. \n\n8\n\n\nUnder the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines. The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines. Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.\n\n9\n\n\nAfter having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.\n\n10\n\n\n Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.\n\n11\n\n\nIn addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n12\n\n\nAs regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.\n\n13\n\n\nAs regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos. The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.\n\nForms of order sought by the parties\n\n14\n\n\n Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:\n\n—\n\n\nset aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and\n\n—\n\n\norder the Commission to pay the costs. \n\n15\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs. \n\nThe appeal\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\n16\n\n\nIn support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.\n\n17\n\n\nIn essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.\n\n18\n\n\nIn that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).\n\n19\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted. It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).\n\n20\n\n\nIn particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).\n\n21\n\n\nSecond, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).\n\n22\n\n\nConsequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.\n\nThe first ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n23\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale. It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines. As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.\n\n24\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created. In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines. The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.\n\n25\n\n\nIn the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational. \n\n26\n\n\n The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n27\n\n\n As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study. Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.\n\n28\n\n\nIn that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal. In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.\n\n29\n\n\nSimilarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted. Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n30\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.\n\n31\n\n\nIn that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).\n\n32\n\n\nIn addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).\n\n33\n\n\nIt is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines. Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.\n\n34\n\n\nIn those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.\n\n35\n\n\nSecondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it. Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.\n\n36\n\n\nAs regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production. Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.\n\n37\n\n\nIn any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.\n\n38\n\n\n Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up. That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder. \n\nThe second ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n39\n\n\n By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines. If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.\n\n40\n\n\nIn the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995. At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003. \n\n41\n\n\n Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible. In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n42\n\n\nAs regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines. That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found. In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment. Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.\n\n43\n\n\nAs regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.\n\n44\n\n\nMoreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue. Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.\n\n45\n\n\nIn any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.\n\n46\n\n\nSince Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed. \n\n47\n\n\n Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.\n\nThe third ground of appeal\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n48\n\n\n By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land. \n\n49\n\n\n The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n50\n\n\nThe third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations. As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case. The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.\n\n51\n\n\n It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up. For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed. \n\nThe action before the General Court\n\n52\n\n\nIn accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.\n\n53\n\n\nSince that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.\n\n54\n\n\nIn that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines. Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.\n\n55\n\n\nHowever, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.\n\n56\n\n\nIndeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.\n\n57\n\n\nIn so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.\n\nCosts\n\n58\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n59\n\n\nSince the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby\n\n\n1.\n\n\nSets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union in Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, EU:T:2015:948) in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s argument based on the purpose for which the expert report on the appraisal of the mines in Cassandra (Greece) had been drawn up during 2004; \n\n\n2.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal as to the remainder;\n\n\n3.\n\n\nDismissess Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou’s action for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE;\n\n\n4.\n\n\nOrders Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou to pay the costs.\n\n\nBerger\n\nBorg Barthet\n\nLevits\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 9 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\n after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 10 November 2016, \n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd (‘Viasat’) seeks to have set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 24 September 2015, Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission (T‑125/12, EU:T:2015:687) (‘the judgment under appeal’), by which that court dismissed its action directed against Commission Decision 2011/839/EU of 20 April 2011 on the measures implemented by Denmark (C 2/03) for TV2/Danmark (OJ 2011 L 340, p. 1) (‘the contested decision’), by which the European Commission, while recognising that certain measures adopted by the Kingdom of Denmark in favour of TV2/Danmark (‘TV2’) had the character of State aid, decided that those measures were to be regarded as compatible with the internal market on the basis of Article 106(2) TFEU. \n\n Background to the dispute\n\n2\n\n\nThe General Court set out the background to the dispute in paragraphs 1 to 17 of the judgment under appeal in the following terms:\n\n‘1.\n\n\nThe subject-matter of this action is a claim for annulment, in part, of [the contested decision] in that it finds that [the measures implemented by Denmark for TV2/Danmark], although amounting to State aid, are nevertheless compatible with the internal market, within the meaning of Article 106(2) TFEU. The action has been brought by [Viasat], which is a commercial broadcasting company active on the Danish market and a direct competitor of the Danish broadcasting company TV2/Danmark A/S (“TV2 A/S”).\n\n2.\n\n\nTV2 A/S was created in order to replace, for accounting and tax purposes as of 1 January 2003, the autonomous State undertaking [TV2], established in 1986, by the Lov No 335 om ændring af lov om radio-og fjernsynsvirksomhed ... [(Law No 335 amending the Law on Broadcasting Services) of 4 June 1986]. TV2 A/S is, as was its predecessor TV2, the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio (“DR”).\n\n3.\n\n\nTV2 A/S, like, previously, TV2, has a public-service mission to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes. These may be broadcast by means of radio equipment, in particular, satellite or cable systems. Rules governing the public-service obligations of TV2 A/S and TV2 are laid down by the Danish Minister for Culture.\n\n4.\n\n\nApart from the public broadcasters, commercial television broadcasters operate on the nationwide television broadcasting market in Denmark. These include, first, [Viasat] and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (“SBS”).\n\n5.\n\n\nTV2 was set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of DR, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers. The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike DR, TV2 would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.\n\n6.\n\n\nFollowing a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting AS/TvDanmark, another commercial broadcaster on the Danish market, the system for funding TV2 was examined by the Commission of the European Communities in its Decision 2004/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for [TV2] (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 1; “the TV2 I decision”). That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: licensing fees, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2 (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2 at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees for nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, “the measures concerned”). Lastly, the Commission’s investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2 to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2’s public-service programmes through those installations.\n\n7.\n\n\nAfter examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (now Article 107(1) TFEU). That conclusion was based on the finding that TV2’s funding system, which sought to compensate it for the cost of providing its public services, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [(C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415) (“the Altmark conditions”)].\n\n8.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission decided that the aid granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2, in the form of licence fees and the other measures described in the TV2 I decision, was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (now Article 106(2) TFEU), with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish Kroner (DKK) which it classified as overcompensation (recital 163 to and Article 1 of the TV2 I decision). It accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2 A/S (Article 2 of the TV2 I decision), which had in the meantime replaced TV2 (see paragraph 2 above).\n\n9.\n\n\nGiven that the recovery of aid referred to in Article 2 of the TV2 I decision rendered TV2 A/S insolvent, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission, by letter of 23 July 2004, of a planned recapitalisation of that company. That plan provided, so far as State-funded measures were concerned, for a capital injection of DKK 440 million, on the one hand, and the conversion into capital of a State loan of DKK 394 million, on the other. By its Decision C(2004) 3632 final of 6 October 2004, in State Aid Case No N 313/2004 relating to the recapitalisation of [TV2 A/S] (OJ 2005 C 172, p. 3; “the recapitalisation decision”), the Commission concluded that the two measures planned for TV2 A/S were “necessary to rebuild the capital which TV2 [A/S] need[ed], following its conversion into a limited company, to fulfil its public-service mission” (recital 53 of the recapitalisation decision). Consequently, the Commission decided that any element of State aid that might be connected with the planned recapitalisation of TV2 A/S was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (recital 55 to the recapitalisation decision).\n\n10.\n\n\nThe TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2 A/S (Case T‑309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T‑317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2 A/S, namely [Viasat] (Case T‑329/04) and SBS (Case T‑336/04).\n\n11.\n\n\nBy judgment of 22 October 2008in TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission [(T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457)], the Court annulled the TV2 I decision. [In paragraph 124 of that judgment], the Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that TV2’s public-service mission was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest ... It also found, however, several instances of illegality vitiating the TV2 I decision, which led, in short, to the annulment of that decision.\n\n12.\n\n\nThus, first, examining the question whether the measures concerned by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons for which it took advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, as State resources [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 160 to 167)]. Second, the Court found that the Commission’s examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the legal and economic considerations which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2. The TV2 I decision was, in consequence, vitiated by failure to state reasons on that point [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 224 to 233)]. Third, the Court held that the Commission’s conclusions on the examination of the compatibility of the aid in the light of Article 86(2) EC, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons. According to the Court, that inadequacy of the reasons stated was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the actual legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2 during the period under investigation [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 192, 197 to 203).\n\n13.\n\n\nThe recapitalisation decision was the subject of two actions for annulment, brought by SBS and by [Viasat]. By two orders delivered on 24 September 2009, the Court ruled that, in the light of the annulment of the TV2 I decision and the close link between the obligation to recover the aid resulting from that decision and the measures which are the subject of the recapitalisation decision, it was no longer necessary to rule on those cases [(orders of 24 September 2009, SBS TV and SBS Danish Television v Commission, T‑12/05, not published, EU:T:2009:357, and [of 24 September 2009,] Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, T‑16/05, not published, EU:T:2009:358)].\n\n14.\n\n\nFollowing the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned. On that occasion, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S and, furthermore, received observations from the third parties.\n\n15.\n\n\nThe Commission presented the result of its re-examination of the measures concerned in the contested decision, which is the subject of the present action and of another action brought by TV2 A/S [(TV2/Danmark v Commission, T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684)], in which the Court has delivered its judgment today.\n\n16.\n\n\nThe contested decision concerns the measures granted to TV2 between 1995 and 2002. However, in its analysis the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.\n\n17.\n\n\nIn the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU in favour of TV2 (recital 153 of the contested decision). First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources (recital 90 to the contested decision) and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, it concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions (recital 153 to the contested decision). However, whereas in the TV2 I decision it had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million was overcompensation incompatible with Article 86(2) EC, in the contested decision the Commission took the view that that sum was a capital buffer appropriate for TV2 A/S (recital 233 to the contested decision). In the operative part of the contested decision, it therefore declared as follows:\n\n“Article 1\n\nThe measures implemented by Denmark in favour of [TV2] between 1995 and 2002 in the form of the licence fee resources and other measures discussed in this Decision are compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 106(2) [TFEU].”’ \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n3\n\n\n By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 March 2012, Viasat sought annulment in part of the contested decision.\n\n4\n\n\nViasat claimed that the State aid granted to TV2 was incompatible with the internal market, raising two pleas in this connection. The first plea alleged an error of law committed by the Commission which, in assessing the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU, did not take into account the second and fourth Altmark conditions. The second plea alleged a failure by the Commission to fulfil its duty to state reasons in so far as that institution, without explaining the reasons for its decision, found that Article 106(2) TFEU applied in the present case, although the second and fourth Altmark conditions were not met.\n\n5\n\n\nBy the judgment under appeal, the General Court declared that it was unnecessary to adjudicate on the action, in so far as that action sought the annulment of the contested decision in that the Commission had found that the advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2 by the TV2 Fund amounted to State aid, and dismissed the action as to the remainder .\n\n6\n\n\n By its judgment of 24 September 2015, TV2/Danmark v Commission (T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684), the General Court, in an action brought by TV2, annulled the contested decision in so far as it had characterised as State Aid the advertising revenue received by TV2 for the years 1995 and 1996. \n\nThe forms of order sought\n\n7\n\n\n Viasat claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed its action and annul the contested decision, and order the Commission to pay the costs of the proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice; and\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, set aside judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the General Court for a decision and reserve the decision on costs. \n\n8\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs incurred at both instances. \n\n9\n\n\n The Kingdom of Denmark contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal.\n\n10\n\n\nTV2 A/S contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, dismiss the appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, maintain the effects of the judgment under appeal and of the contested decision; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs of TV2 A/S. \n\nThe request to reopen the oral procedure\n\n11\n\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Advocate General’s Opinion, Viasat, by letter of 3 January 2017, requested the Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure. In support of its request, Viasat submits that the Advocate General’s Opinion distorts some of its arguments and raises separate arguments which were not debated between the parties.\n\n12\n\n\nIt should be borne in mind that, according to Article 83 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that court may, at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n13\n\n\nHowever, the Statute and those Rules make no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk, C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).\n\n14\n\n\nIn that regard, it follows from the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU that it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which require his involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based. Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions examined in that Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraphs 60 and 61 and the case-law cited).\n\n15\n\n\nThe Court therefore considers, having heard the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary information to give judgment and that the information has been the subject of debate between the parties.\n\n16\n\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.\n\nThe appeal\n\nThe first plea, alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n17\n\n\nBy its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measures concerned in the light of the requirements set out in Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular those providing that, first, the application of the rules of the Treaties must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned and, secondly, the performance of those tasks must not affect the development of trade as would be contrary to the interests of the European Union, was not required to take into consideration the fact that those measures did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions. According to those conditions, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation for the performance of the public service is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner, and that compensation must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical and well run undertaking would have incurred in performing the public service tasks concerned.\n\n18\n\n\nViasat claims that it is apparent from the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU that the requirement that the application of the rules in the Treaties, in particular the competition rules, must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned must be interpreted so as to refer to the other provisions of the Treaty. Thus, in an assessment of the compatibility of State aid in the light of Article 106(2) TFEU, those other provisions must be examined beforehand. Therefore, in the present case it should, according to Viasat, have been ascertained in this connection whether or not the application of any of the Altmark conditions obstructed the performance of the public service tasks assigned to TV2. Had that examination taken place, the Commission would have concluded that the adoption, in favour of TV2, of measures meeting the second and fourth Altmark conditions would not have obstructed the performance of that task.\n\n19\n\n\nConsequently, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements that the performance of the tasks at issue must be obstructed and the development of trade cannot be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union, the Commission should have requested the Kingdom of Denmark to prove that complying with the second and fourth Altmark conditions would have prevented the performance of the tasks of general economic interest assigned to TV2. \n\n20\n\n\n The Commission, the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S contend that the first ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n21\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission was not required, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, to take the second and fourth Altmark conditions into consideration in order to ascertain whether compliance with those conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n22\n\n\nIn this connection it must be recalled that, for a national measure to be categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, there must, first, be an intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient and, fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).\n\n23\n\n\nSince those conditions are cumulative, a State measure cannot be characterised as State aid if one of them is not satisfied. By contrast, if all those conditions are met, that measure constitutes State aid and, accordingly, unless it is covered by a derogation provided for by the Treaties, is incompatible with the internal market.\n\n24\n\n\nSo far as concerns the third criterion for characterising a measure as State aid, it is settled case-law that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are regarded as State aid (see judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraph 34).\n\n25\n\n\nHowever, the Court has stated that, where a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations, so that those undertakings do not enjoy a real financial advantage and the measure thus does not have the effect of putting them in a more favourable competitive position than the undertakings competing with them, such a measure is not caught by Article 107(1) TFEU (see judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 87).\n\n26\n\n\nIn accordance with paragraphs 88 to 93 of the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), in order for such a measure not to be characterised as State aid a number of conditions must be met.  First, the recipient undertaking must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined.  Second, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner.  Third, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations.  Fourth, the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations.\n\n27\n\n\nIf the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph were not met, the State measure at issue would be deemed to confer a selective advantage on the recipient undertaking and if, moreover, the other criteria set out in Article 107(1) TFEU were met, that measure would constitute aid in principle incompatible with the internal market.\n\n28\n\n\nArticle 106(2) TFEU provides that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are to be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them and that the development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union.\n\n29\n\n\nAs is provided by case-law, the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU itself shows that exemptions to the Treaty rules are permitted provided that they are necessary for performance of the particular tasks assigned to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 54 and of 28 February 2013, Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas, C‑1/12, EU:C:2013:127, paragraph 106).\n\n30\n\n\nIn that regard, it is clear from the Court’s case-law that it is not necessary that the financial balance or economic viability of the undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest should be threatened.  It is sufficient that, in the absence of the rights at issue, it would not be possible for the undertaking to perform the particular tasks entrusted to it, or that maintenance of those rights is necessary to enable the holder of them to perform tasks of general economic interest which have been assigned to it under economically acceptable conditions (judgment of 15 November 2007, International Mail Spain, C‑162/06, EU:C:2007:681, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).\n\n31\n\n\nIn allowing derogations to be made from the general rules of the Treaty in certain circumstances, Article 106(2) TFEU seeks to reconcile the Member States’ interest in using certain undertakings, in particular in the public sector, as an instrument of economic or fiscal policy with the Union’s interest in ensuring compliance with the rules on competition and the preservation of the unity of the common market (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 55).\n\n32\n\n\nAs set out in paragraph 21 above, Viasat submits that the Commission was required to examine, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, whether meeting the second and the fourth Altmark conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n33\n\n\nIt must be pointed out in this connection that in order to assess a measure under Article 106(2) TFEU, the Commission is not required, contrary to what is claimed by the appellant, to examine whether the conditions laid down by the case-law in Altmark, in particular the second and fourth of those conditions, are met.\n\n34\n\n\nAs the General Court indeed held in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, verification of the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law occurs upstream, that is to say in the examination of the issue of whether the measures at issue must be characterised as State aid.  That issue must be resolved before the one which consists in examining, where necessary, if incompatible aid is nevertheless necessary to the performance of the tasks assigned to the recipient of the measure at issue, under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n35\n\n\nBy contrast, the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law are no longer to be applied where the Commission, having found that a measure must be characterised as aid, in particular in so far as the recipient undertaking is unable to pass the test of comparison with a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public-service requirements, examines whether that aid can be justified under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n36\n\nThat latter provision, which is supplemented by the Protocol (No. 26) on Services of General Interest (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 308) and, as regards the field at issue in the present case, by the Protocol (No. 29) on the System of Public Broadcasting in the Member States (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 312), cannot be interpreted in isolation having regard merely to its wording without also taking into account the additional information in those protocols.\n\n37\n\n\nThe finding in paragraph 35 of the present judgment is supported, as the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, by the wording of Protocol No. 29, which states that ‘the provisions of the Treaties shall be without prejudice to the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting and in so far as such funding is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of the public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and in so far as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Union to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest, while the realisation of the remit of that public service shall be taken into account.’\n\n38\n\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, the General Court therefore did not err in law when it held in the judgment under appeal that Article 106(2) TFEU does not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision.\n\n39\n\n\nThe first ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.\n\nThe second ground of appeal, alleging breach of Article 296 TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n40\n\n\nBy its second ground of appeal, Viasat takes issue with paragraphs 103 and 104 of the judgment under appeal on the ground that the General Court erred in law by rejecting its plea for annulment based on the Commission’s infringement in the contested decision of its obligation to state reasons under Article 296 TFEU.\n\n41\n\n\nViasat also alleges that the General Court failed to reply to the pleas raised in the application at first instance.\n42\n\n\nThe Commission contends that the second ground of appeal is in part inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n43\n\nIt is settled case-law that the statement of reasons required under Article 296 TFEU must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the competent Court of the European Union to exercise its jurisdiction to review legality (judgment of 29 September 2011, Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C‑521/09 P, EU:C:2011:620, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited).\n\n44\n\n\nIt must be observed in this connection that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the plea alleging a failure to state reasons in the contested decision by stating that ‘the fact that the contested decision does not mention the role of the second and fourth Altmark conditions in the assessment of the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market is not attributable to an error of reasoning on the part of the Commission or to a failure to state reasons vitiating the contested decision, but rather to the fact that that decision applies a different analytical framework from that which favours [Viasat]’.\n\n45\n\n\nAs Viasat has conceded, the contested decision would only be vitiated by a failure to state reasons if the Commission had been required to apply the analytical framework which, according to Viasat, results from Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n46\n\n\nHowever, it follows from paragraph 37 above that Article 106(2) TFEU did not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision. Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in holding that sufficient reasons were stated for the contested decision.\n\n47\n\n\nMoreover, as the Advocate General observed in point 58 of his Opinion, the complaint alleging a failure to respond to the pleas raised in the application at first instance is insufficiently developed for the other parties to the appeal to respond to or for the Court to rule on. Consequently, it is inadmissible.\n\n48\n\n\n Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected as in part inadmissible and in part unfounded.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.\n\nCosts\n\n50\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which apply to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n51\n\n\nSince the Commission and TV2 A/S have applied for costs and Viasat has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay their costs.\n\n52\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure, also applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those Rules, the Member States and institutions which intervene in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.\n\n53\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark, as an intervener before the General Court, is to bear its own costs.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal;\n\n\n2.\n\n\nOrders Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd to pay the costs incurred by the European Commission and TV2/Danmark A/S; \n\n\n3.\n\n\nDeclares that the Kingdom of Denmark is to bear its own costs.\n\n\nSilva de Lapuerta\n\nRegan\n\nBonichot\n\nArabadjiev\n\nFernlund\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 8 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\n after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 10 November 2016, \n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd (‘Viasat’) seeks to have set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 24 September 2015, Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission (T‑125/12, EU:T:2015:687) (‘the judgment under appeal’), by which that court dismissed its action directed against Commission Decision 2011/839/EU of 20 April 2011 on the measures implemented by Denmark (C 2/03) for TV2/Danmark (OJ 2011 L 340, p. 1) (‘the contested decision’), by which the European Commission, while recognising that certain measures adopted by the Kingdom of Denmark in favour of TV2/Danmark (‘TV2’) had the character of State aid, decided that those measures were to be regarded as compatible with the internal market on the basis of Article 106(2) TFEU. \n\n Background to the dispute\n\n2\n\n\nThe General Court set out the background to the dispute in paragraphs 1 to 17 of the judgment under appeal in the following terms:\n\n‘1.\n\n\nThe subject-matter of this action is a claim for annulment, in part, of [the contested decision] in that it finds that [the measures implemented by Denmark for TV2/Danmark], although amounting to State aid, are nevertheless compatible with the internal market, within the meaning of Article 106(2) TFEU. The action has been brought by [Viasat], which is a commercial broadcasting company active on the Danish market and a direct competitor of the Danish broadcasting company TV2/Danmark A/S (“TV2 A/S”).\n\n2.\n\n\nTV2 A/S was created in order to replace, for accounting and tax purposes as of 1 January 2003, the autonomous State undertaking [TV2], established in 1986, by the Lov No 335 om ændring af lov om radio-og fjernsynsvirksomhed ... [(Law No 335 amending the Law on Broadcasting Services) of 4 June 1986]. TV2 A/S is, as was its predecessor TV2, the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio (“DR”).\n\n3.\n\n\nTV2 A/S, like, previously, TV2, has a public-service mission to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes. These may be broadcast by means of radio equipment, in particular, satellite or cable systems. Rules governing the public-service obligations of TV2 A/S and TV2 are laid down by the Danish Minister for Culture.\n\n4.\n\n\nApart from the public broadcasters, commercial television broadcasters operate on the nationwide television broadcasting market in Denmark. These include, first, [Viasat] and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (“SBS”).\n\n5.\n\n\nTV2 was set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of DR, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers. The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike DR, TV2 would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.\n\n6.\n\n\nFollowing a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting AS/TvDanmark, another commercial broadcaster on the Danish market, the system for funding TV2 was examined by the Commission of the European Communities in its Decision 2004/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for [TV2] (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 1; “the TV2 I decision”). That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: licensing fees, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2 (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2 at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees for nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, “the measures concerned”). Lastly, the Commission’s investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2 to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2’s public-service programmes through those installations.\n\n7.\n\n\nAfter examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (now Article 107(1) TFEU). That conclusion was based on the finding that TV2’s funding system, which sought to compensate it for the cost of providing its public services, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [(C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415) (“the Altmark conditions”)].\n\n8.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission decided that the aid granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2, in the form of licence fees and the other measures described in the TV2 I decision, was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (now Article 106(2) TFEU), with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish Kroner (DKK) which it classified as overcompensation (recital 163 to and Article 1 of the TV2 I decision). It accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2 A/S (Article 2 of the TV2 I decision), which had in the meantime replaced TV2 (see paragraph 2 above).\n\n9.\n\n\nGiven that the recovery of aid referred to in Article 2 of the TV2 I decision rendered TV2 A/S insolvent, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission, by letter of 23 July 2004, of a planned recapitalisation of that company. That plan provided, so far as State-funded measures were concerned, for a capital injection of DKK 440 million, on the one hand, and the conversion into capital of a State loan of DKK 394 million, on the other. By its Decision C(2004) 3632 final of 6 October 2004, in State Aid Case No N 313/2004 relating to the recapitalisation of [TV2 A/S] (OJ 2005 C 172, p. 3; “the recapitalisation decision”), the Commission concluded that the two measures planned for TV2 A/S were “necessary to rebuild the capital which TV2 [A/S] need[ed], following its conversion into a limited company, to fulfil its public-service mission” (recital 53 of the recapitalisation decision). Consequently, the Commission decided that any element of State aid that might be connected with the planned recapitalisation of TV2 A/S was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (recital 55 to the recapitalisation decision).\n\n10.\n\n\nThe TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2 A/S (Case T‑309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T‑317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2 A/S, namely [Viasat] (Case T‑329/04) and SBS (Case T‑336/04).\n\n11.\n\n\nBy judgment of 22 October 2008in TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission [(T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457)], the Court annulled the TV2 I decision. [In paragraph 124 of that judgment], the Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that TV2’s public-service mission was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest ... It also found, however, several instances of illegality vitiating the TV2 I decision, which led, in short, to the annulment of that decision.\n\n12.\n\n\nThus, first, examining the question whether the measures concerned by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons for which it took advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, as State resources [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 160 to 167)]. Second, the Court found that the Commission’s examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the legal and economic considerations which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2. The TV2 I decision was, in consequence, vitiated by failure to state reasons on that point [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 224 to 233)]. Third, the Court held that the Commission’s conclusions on the examination of the compatibility of the aid in the light of Article 86(2) EC, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons. According to the Court, that inadequacy of the reasons stated was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the actual legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2 during the period under investigation [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 192, 197 to 203).\n\n13.\n\n\nThe recapitalisation decision was the subject of two actions for annulment, brought by SBS and by [Viasat]. By two orders delivered on 24 September 2009, the Court ruled that, in the light of the annulment of the TV2 I decision and the close link between the obligation to recover the aid resulting from that decision and the measures which are the subject of the recapitalisation decision, it was no longer necessary to rule on those cases [(orders of 24 September 2009, SBS TV and SBS Danish Television v Commission, T‑12/05, not published, EU:T:2009:357, and [of 24 September 2009,] Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, T‑16/05, not published, EU:T:2009:358)].\n\n14.\n\n\nFollowing the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned. On that occasion, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S and, furthermore, received observations from the third parties.\n\n15.\n\n\nThe Commission presented the result of its re-examination of the measures concerned in the contested decision, which is the subject of the present action and of another action brought by TV2 A/S [(TV2/Danmark v Commission, T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684)], in which the Court has delivered its judgment today.\n\n16.\n\n\nThe contested decision concerns the measures granted to TV2 between 1995 and 2002. However, in its analysis the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.\n\n17.\n\n\nIn the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU in favour of TV2 (recital 153 of the contested decision). First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources (recital 90 to the contested decision) and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, it concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions (recital 153 to the contested decision). However, whereas in the TV2 I decision it had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million was overcompensation incompatible with Article 86(2) EC, in the contested decision the Commission took the view that that sum was a capital buffer appropriate for TV2 A/S (recital 233 to the contested decision). In the operative part of the contested decision, it therefore declared as follows:\n\n“Article 1\n\nThe measures implemented by Denmark in favour of [TV2] between 1995 and 2002 in the form of the licence fee resources and other measures discussed in this Decision are compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 106(2) [TFEU].”’ \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n3\n\n\n By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 March 2012, Viasat sought annulment in part of the contested decision.\n\n4\n\n\nViasat claimed that the State aid granted to TV2 was incompatible with the internal market, raising two pleas in this connection. The first plea alleged an error of law committed by the Commission which, in assessing the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU, did not take into account the second and fourth Altmark conditions. The second plea alleged a failure by the Commission to fulfil its duty to state reasons in so far as that institution, without explaining the reasons for its decision, found that Article 106(2) TFEU applied in the present case, although the second and fourth Altmark conditions were not met.\n\n5\n\n\nBy the judgment under appeal, the General Court declared that it was unnecessary to adjudicate on the action, in so far as that action sought the annulment of the contested decision in that the Commission had found that the advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2 by the TV2 Fund amounted to State aid, and dismissed the action as to the remainder .\n\n6\n\n\n By its judgment of 24 September 2015, TV2/Danmark v Commission (T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684), the General Court, in an action brought by TV2, annulled the contested decision in so far as it had characterised as State Aid the advertising revenue received by TV2 for the years 1995 and 1996. \n\nThe forms of order sought\n\n7\n\n\n Viasat claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed its action and annul the contested decision, and order the Commission to pay the costs of the proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice; and\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, set aside judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the General Court for a decision and reserve the decision on costs. \n\n8\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs incurred at both instances. \n\n9\n\n\n The Kingdom of Denmark contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal.\n\n10\n\n\nTV2 A/S contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, dismiss the appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, maintain the effects of the judgment under appeal and of the contested decision; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs of TV2 A/S. \n\nThe request to reopen the oral procedure\n\n11\n\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Advocate General’s Opinion, Viasat, by letter of 3 January 2017, requested the Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure. In support of its request, Viasat submits that the Advocate General’s Opinion distorts some of its arguments and raises separate arguments which were not debated between the parties.\n\n12\n\n\nIt should be borne in mind that, according to Article 83 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that court may, at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n13\n\n\nHowever, the Statute and those Rules make no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk, C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).\n\n14\n\n\nIn that regard, it follows from the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU that it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which require his involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based. Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions examined in that Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraphs 60 and 61 and the case-law cited).\n\n15\n\n\nThe Court therefore considers, having heard the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary information to give judgment and that the information has been the subject of debate between the parties.\n\n16\n\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.\n\nThe appeal\n\nThe first plea, alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n17\n\n\nBy its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measures concerned in the light of the requirements set out in Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular those providing that, first, the application of the rules of the Treaties must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned and, secondly, the performance of those tasks must not affect the development of trade as would be contrary to the interests of the European Union, was not required to take into consideration the fact that those measures did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions. According to those conditions, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation for the performance of the public service is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner, and that compensation must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical and well run undertaking would have incurred in performing the public service tasks concerned.\n\n18\n\n\nViasat claims that it is apparent from the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU that the requirement that the application of the rules in the Treaties, in particular the competition rules, must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned must be interpreted so as to refer to the other provisions of the Treaty. Thus, in an assessment of the compatibility of State aid in the light of Article 106(2) TFEU, those other provisions must be examined beforehand. Therefore, in the present case it should, according to Viasat, have been ascertained in this connection whether or not the application of any of the Altmark conditions obstructed the performance of the public service tasks assigned to TV2. Had that examination taken place, the Commission would have concluded that the adoption, in favour of TV2, of measures meeting the second and fourth Altmark conditions would not have obstructed the performance of that task.\n\n19\n\n\nConsequently, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements that the performance of the tasks at issue must be obstructed and the development of trade cannot be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union, the Commission should have requested the Kingdom of Denmark to prove that complying with the second and fourth Altmark conditions would have prevented the performance of the tasks of general economic interest assigned to TV2. \n\n20\n\n\n The Commission, the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S contend that the first ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n21\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission was not required, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, to take the second and fourth Altmark conditions into consideration in order to ascertain whether compliance with those conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n22\n\n\nIn this connection it must be recalled that, for a national measure to be categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, there must, first, be an intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient and, fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).\n\n23\n\n\nSince those conditions are cumulative, a State measure cannot be characterised as State aid if one of them is not satisfied. By contrast, if all those conditions are met, that measure constitutes State aid and, accordingly, unless it is covered by a derogation provided for by the Treaties, is incompatible with the internal market.\n\n24\n\n\nSo far as concerns the third criterion for characterising a measure as State aid, it is settled case-law that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are regarded as State aid (see judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraph 34).\n\n25\n\n\nHowever, the Court has stated that, where a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations, so that those undertakings do not enjoy a real financial advantage and the measure thus does not have the effect of putting them in a more favourable competitive position than the undertakings competing with them, such a measure is not caught by Article 107(1) TFEU (see judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 87).\n\n26\n\n\nIn accordance with paragraphs 88 to 93 of the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), in order for such a measure not to be characterised as State aid a number of conditions must be met.  First, the recipient undertaking must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined.  Second, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner.  Third, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations.  Fourth, the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations.\n\n27\n\n\nIf the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph were not met, the State measure at issue would be deemed to confer a selective advantage on the recipient undertaking and if, moreover, the other criteria set out in Article 107(1) TFEU were met, that measure would constitute aid in principle incompatible with the internal market.\n\n28\n\n\nArticle 106(2) TFEU provides that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are to be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them and that the development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union.\n\n29\n\n\nAs is provided by case-law, the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU itself shows that exemptions to the Treaty rules are permitted provided that they are necessary for performance of the particular tasks assigned to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 54 and of 28 February 2013, Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas, C‑1/12, EU:C:2013:127, paragraph 106).\n\n30\n\n\nIn that regard, it is clear from the Court’s case-law that it is not necessary that the financial balance or economic viability of the undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest should be threatened.  It is sufficient that, in the absence of the rights at issue, it would not be possible for the undertaking to perform the particular tasks entrusted to it, or that maintenance of those rights is necessary to enable the holder of them to perform tasks of general economic interest which have been assigned to it under economically acceptable conditions (judgment of 15 November 2007, International Mail Spain, C‑162/06, EU:C:2007:681, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).\n\n31\n\n\nIn allowing derogations to be made from the general rules of the Treaty in certain circumstances, Article 106(2) TFEU seeks to reconcile the Member States’ interest in using certain undertakings, in particular in the public sector, as an instrument of economic or fiscal policy with the Union’s interest in ensuring compliance with the rules on competition and the preservation of the unity of the common market (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 55).\n\n32\n\n\nAs set out in paragraph 21 above, Viasat submits that the Commission was required to examine, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, whether meeting the second and the fourth Altmark conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n33\n\n\nIt must be pointed out in this connection that in order to assess a measure under Article 106(2) TFEU, the Commission is not required, contrary to what is claimed by the appellant, to examine whether the conditions laid down by the case-law in Altmark, in particular the second and fourth of those conditions, are met.\n\n34\n\n\nAs the General Court indeed held in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, verification of the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law occurs upstream, that is to say in the examination of the issue of whether the measures at issue must be characterised as State aid.  That issue must be resolved before the one which consists in examining, where necessary, if incompatible aid is nevertheless necessary to the performance of the tasks assigned to the recipient of the measure at issue, under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n35\n\n\nBy contrast, the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law are no longer to be applied where the Commission, having found that a measure must be characterised as aid, in particular in so far as the recipient undertaking is unable to pass the test of comparison with a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public-service requirements, examines whether that aid can be justified under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n36\n\nThat latter provision, which is supplemented by the Protocol (No. 26) on Services of General Interest (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 308) and, as regards the field at issue in the present case, by the Protocol (No. 29) on the System of Public Broadcasting in the Member States (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 312), cannot be interpreted in isolation having regard merely to its wording without also taking into account the additional information in those protocols.\n\n37\n\n\nThe finding in paragraph 35 of the present judgment is supported, as the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, by the wording of Protocol No. 29, which states that ‘the provisions of the Treaties shall be without prejudice to the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting and in so far as such funding is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of the public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and in so far as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Union to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest, while the realisation of the remit of that public service shall be taken into account.’\n\n38\n\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, the General Court therefore did not err in law when it held in the judgment under appeal that Article 106(2) TFEU does not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision.\n\n39\n\n\nThe first ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.\n\nThe second ground of appeal, alleging breach of Article 296 TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n40\n\n\nBy its second ground of appeal, Viasat takes issue with paragraphs 103 and 104 of the judgment under appeal on the ground that the General Court erred in law by rejecting its plea for annulment based on the Commission’s infringement in the contested decision of its obligation to state reasons under Article 296 TFEU.\n\n41\n\n\nViasat also alleges that the General Court failed to reply to the pleas raised in the application at first instance.\n42\n\n\nThe Commission contends that the second ground of appeal is in part inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n43\n\nIt is settled case-law that the statement of reasons required under Article 296 TFEU must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the competent Court of the European Union to exercise its jurisdiction to review legality (judgment of 29 September 2011, Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C‑521/09 P, EU:C:2011:620, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited).\n\n44\n\n\nIt must be observed in this connection that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the plea alleging a failure to state reasons in the contested decision by stating that ‘the fact that the contested decision does not mention the role of the second and fourth Altmark conditions in the assessment of the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market is not attributable to an error of reasoning on the part of the Commission or to a failure to state reasons vitiating the contested decision, but rather to the fact that that decision applies a different analytical framework from that which favours [Viasat]’.\n\n45\n\n\nAs Viasat has conceded, the contested decision would only be vitiated by a failure to state reasons if the Commission had been required to apply the analytical framework which, according to Viasat, results from Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n46\n\n\nHowever, it follows from paragraph 37 above that Article 106(2) TFEU did not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision. Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in holding that sufficient reasons were stated for the contested decision.\n\n47\n\n\nMoreover, as the Advocate General observed in point 58 of his Opinion, the complaint alleging a failure to respond to the pleas raised in the application at first instance is insufficiently developed for the other parties to the appeal to respond to or for the Court to rule on. Consequently, it is inadmissible.\n\n48\n\n\n Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected as in part inadmissible and in part unfounded.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.\n\nCosts\n\n50\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which apply to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n51\n\n\nSince the Commission and TV2 A/S have applied for costs and Viasat has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay their costs.\n\n52\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure, also applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those Rules, the Member States and institutions which intervene in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.\n\n53\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark, as an intervener before the General Court, is to bear its own costs.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal;\n\n\n2.\n\n\nOrders Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd to pay the costs incurred by the European Commission and TV2/Danmark A/S; \n\n\n3.\n\n\nDeclares that the Kingdom of Denmark is to bear its own costs.\n\n\nSilva de Lapuerta\n\nRegan\n\nBonichot\n\nArabadjiev\n\nFernlund\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 8 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\n after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 10 November 2016, \n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd (‘Viasat’) seeks to have set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 24 September 2015, Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission (T‑125/12, EU:T:2015:687) (‘the judgment under appeal’), by which that court dismissed its action directed against Commission Decision 2011/839/EU of 20 April 2011 on the measures implemented by Denmark (C 2/03) for TV2/Danmark (OJ 2011 L 340, p. 1) (‘the contested decision’), by which the European Commission, while recognising that certain measures adopted by the Kingdom of Denmark in favour of TV2/Danmark (‘TV2’) had the character of State aid, decided that those measures were to be regarded as compatible with the internal market on the basis of Article 106(2) TFEU. \n\n Background to the dispute\n\n2\n\n\nThe General Court set out the background to the dispute in paragraphs 1 to 17 of the judgment under appeal in the following terms:\n\n‘1.\n\n\nThe subject-matter of this action is a claim for annulment, in part, of [the contested decision] in that it finds that [the measures implemented by Denmark for TV2/Danmark], although amounting to State aid, are nevertheless compatible with the internal market, within the meaning of Article 106(2) TFEU. The action has been brought by [Viasat], which is a commercial broadcasting company active on the Danish market and a direct competitor of the Danish broadcasting company TV2/Danmark A/S (“TV2 A/S”).\n\n2.\n\n\nTV2 A/S was created in order to replace, for accounting and tax purposes as of 1 January 2003, the autonomous State undertaking [TV2], established in 1986, by the Lov No 335 om ændring af lov om radio-og fjernsynsvirksomhed ... [(Law No 335 amending the Law on Broadcasting Services) of 4 June 1986]. TV2 A/S is, as was its predecessor TV2, the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio (“DR”).\n\n3.\n\n\nTV2 A/S, like, previously, TV2, has a public-service mission to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes. These may be broadcast by means of radio equipment, in particular, satellite or cable systems. Rules governing the public-service obligations of TV2 A/S and TV2 are laid down by the Danish Minister for Culture.\n\n4.\n\n\nApart from the public broadcasters, commercial television broadcasters operate on the nationwide television broadcasting market in Denmark. These include, first, [Viasat] and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (“SBS”).\n\n5.\n\n\nTV2 was set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of DR, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers. The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike DR, TV2 would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.\n\n6.\n\n\nFollowing a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting AS/TvDanmark, another commercial broadcaster on the Danish market, the system for funding TV2 was examined by the Commission of the European Communities in its Decision 2004/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for [TV2] (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 1; “the TV2 I decision”). That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: licensing fees, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2 (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2 at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees for nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, “the measures concerned”). Lastly, the Commission’s investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2 to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2’s public-service programmes through those installations.\n\n7.\n\n\nAfter examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (now Article 107(1) TFEU). That conclusion was based on the finding that TV2’s funding system, which sought to compensate it for the cost of providing its public services, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [(C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415) (“the Altmark conditions”)].\n\n8.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission decided that the aid granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2, in the form of licence fees and the other measures described in the TV2 I decision, was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (now Article 106(2) TFEU), with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish Kroner (DKK) which it classified as overcompensation (recital 163 to and Article 1 of the TV2 I decision). It accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2 A/S (Article 2 of the TV2 I decision), which had in the meantime replaced TV2 (see paragraph 2 above).\n\n9.\n\n\nGiven that the recovery of aid referred to in Article 2 of the TV2 I decision rendered TV2 A/S insolvent, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission, by letter of 23 July 2004, of a planned recapitalisation of that company. That plan provided, so far as State-funded measures were concerned, for a capital injection of DKK 440 million, on the one hand, and the conversion into capital of a State loan of DKK 394 million, on the other. By its Decision C(2004) 3632 final of 6 October 2004, in State Aid Case No N 313/2004 relating to the recapitalisation of [TV2 A/S] (OJ 2005 C 172, p. 3; “the recapitalisation decision”), the Commission concluded that the two measures planned for TV2 A/S were “necessary to rebuild the capital which TV2 [A/S] need[ed], following its conversion into a limited company, to fulfil its public-service mission” (recital 53 of the recapitalisation decision). Consequently, the Commission decided that any element of State aid that might be connected with the planned recapitalisation of TV2 A/S was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (recital 55 to the recapitalisation decision).\n\n10.\n\n\nThe TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2 A/S (Case T‑309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T‑317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2 A/S, namely [Viasat] (Case T‑329/04) and SBS (Case T‑336/04).\n\n11.\n\n\nBy judgment of 22 October 2008in TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission [(T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457)], the Court annulled the TV2 I decision. [In paragraph 124 of that judgment], the Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that TV2’s public-service mission was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest ... It also found, however, several instances of illegality vitiating the TV2 I decision, which led, in short, to the annulment of that decision.\n\n12.\n\n\nThus, first, examining the question whether the measures concerned by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons for which it took advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, as State resources [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 160 to 167)]. Second, the Court found that the Commission’s examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the legal and economic considerations which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2. The TV2 I decision was, in consequence, vitiated by failure to state reasons on that point [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 224 to 233)]. Third, the Court held that the Commission’s conclusions on the examination of the compatibility of the aid in the light of Article 86(2) EC, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons. According to the Court, that inadequacy of the reasons stated was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the actual legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2 during the period under investigation [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 192, 197 to 203).\n\n13.\n\n\nThe recapitalisation decision was the subject of two actions for annulment, brought by SBS and by [Viasat]. By two orders delivered on 24 September 2009, the Court ruled that, in the light of the annulment of the TV2 I decision and the close link between the obligation to recover the aid resulting from that decision and the measures which are the subject of the recapitalisation decision, it was no longer necessary to rule on those cases [(orders of 24 September 2009, SBS TV and SBS Danish Television v Commission, T‑12/05, not published, EU:T:2009:357, and [of 24 September 2009,] Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, T‑16/05, not published, EU:T:2009:358)].\n\n14.\n\n\nFollowing the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned. On that occasion, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S and, furthermore, received observations from the third parties.\n\n15.\n\n\nThe Commission presented the result of its re-examination of the measures concerned in the contested decision, which is the subject of the present action and of another action brought by TV2 A/S [(TV2/Danmark v Commission, T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684)], in which the Court has delivered its judgment today.\n\n16.\n\n\nThe contested decision concerns the measures granted to TV2 between 1995 and 2002. However, in its analysis the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.\n\n17.\n\n\nIn the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU in favour of TV2 (recital 153 of the contested decision). First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources (recital 90 to the contested decision) and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, it concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions (recital 153 to the contested decision). However, whereas in the TV2 I decision it had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million was overcompensation incompatible with Article 86(2) EC, in the contested decision the Commission took the view that that sum was a capital buffer appropriate for TV2 A/S (recital 233 to the contested decision). In the operative part of the contested decision, it therefore declared as follows:\n\n“Article 1\n\nThe measures implemented by Denmark in favour of [TV2] between 1995 and 2002 in the form of the licence fee resources and other measures discussed in this Decision are compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 106(2) [TFEU].”’ \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n3\n\n\n By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 March 2012, Viasat sought annulment in part of the contested decision.\n\n4\n\n\nViasat claimed that the State aid granted to TV2 was incompatible with the internal market, raising two pleas in this connection. The first plea alleged an error of law committed by the Commission which, in assessing the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU, did not take into account the second and fourth Altmark conditions. The second plea alleged a failure by the Commission to fulfil its duty to state reasons in so far as that institution, without explaining the reasons for its decision, found that Article 106(2) TFEU applied in the present case, although the second and fourth Altmark conditions were not met.\n\n5\n\n\nBy the judgment under appeal, the General Court declared that it was unnecessary to adjudicate on the action, in so far as that action sought the annulment of the contested decision in that the Commission had found that the advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2 by the TV2 Fund amounted to State aid, and dismissed the action as to the remainder .\n\n6\n\n\n By its judgment of 24 September 2015, TV2/Danmark v Commission (T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684), the General Court, in an action brought by TV2, annulled the contested decision in so far as it had characterised as State Aid the advertising revenue received by TV2 for the years 1995 and 1996. \n\nThe forms of order sought\n\n7\n\n\n Viasat claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed its action and annul the contested decision, and order the Commission to pay the costs of the proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice; and\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, set aside judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the General Court for a decision and reserve the decision on costs. \n\n8\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs incurred at both instances. \n\n9\n\n\n The Kingdom of Denmark contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal.\n\n10\n\n\nTV2 A/S contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, dismiss the appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, maintain the effects of the judgment under appeal and of the contested decision; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs of TV2 A/S. \n\nThe request to reopen the oral procedure\n\n11\n\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Advocate General’s Opinion, Viasat, by letter of 3 January 2017, requested the Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure. In support of its request, Viasat submits that the Advocate General’s Opinion distorts some of its arguments and raises separate arguments which were not debated between the parties.\n\n12\n\n\nIt should be borne in mind that, according to Article 83 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that court may, at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n13\n\n\nHowever, the Statute and those Rules make no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk, C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).\n\n14\n\n\nIn that regard, it follows from the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU that it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which require his involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based. Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions examined in that Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraphs 60 and 61 and the case-law cited).\n\n15\n\n\nThe Court therefore considers, having heard the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary information to give judgment and that the information has been the subject of debate between the parties.\n\n16\n\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.\n\nThe appeal\n\nThe first plea, alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n17\n\n\nBy its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measures concerned in the light of the requirements set out in Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular those providing that, first, the application of the rules of the Treaties must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned and, secondly, the performance of those tasks must not affect the development of trade as would be contrary to the interests of the European Union, was not required to take into consideration the fact that those measures did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions. According to those conditions, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation for the performance of the public service is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner, and that compensation must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical and well run undertaking would have incurred in performing the public service tasks concerned.\n\n18\n\n\nViasat claims that it is apparent from the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU that the requirement that the application of the rules in the Treaties, in particular the competition rules, must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned must be interpreted so as to refer to the other provisions of the Treaty. Thus, in an assessment of the compatibility of State aid in the light of Article 106(2) TFEU, those other provisions must be examined beforehand. Therefore, in the present case it should, according to Viasat, have been ascertained in this connection whether or not the application of any of the Altmark conditions obstructed the performance of the public service tasks assigned to TV2. Had that examination taken place, the Commission would have concluded that the adoption, in favour of TV2, of measures meeting the second and fourth Altmark conditions would not have obstructed the performance of that task.\n\n19\n\n\nConsequently, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements that the performance of the tasks at issue must be obstructed and the development of trade cannot be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union, the Commission should have requested the Kingdom of Denmark to prove that complying with the second and fourth Altmark conditions would have prevented the performance of the tasks of general economic interest assigned to TV2. \n\n20\n\n\n The Commission, the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S contend that the first ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n21\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission was not required, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, to take the second and fourth Altmark conditions into consideration in order to ascertain whether compliance with those conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n22\n\n\nIn this connection it must be recalled that, for a national measure to be categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, there must, first, be an intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient and, fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).\n\n23\n\n\nSince those conditions are cumulative, a State measure cannot be characterised as State aid if one of them is not satisfied. By contrast, if all those conditions are met, that measure constitutes State aid and, accordingly, unless it is covered by a derogation provided for by the Treaties, is incompatible with the internal market.\n\n24\n\n\nSo far as concerns the third criterion for characterising a measure as State aid, it is settled case-law that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are regarded as State aid (see judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraph 34).\n\n25\n\n\nHowever, the Court has stated that, where a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations, so that those undertakings do not enjoy a real financial advantage and the measure thus does not have the effect of putting them in a more favourable competitive position than the undertakings competing with them, such a measure is not caught by Article 107(1) TFEU (see judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 87).\n\n26\n\n\nIn accordance with paragraphs 88 to 93 of the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), in order for such a measure not to be characterised as State aid a number of conditions must be met.  First, the recipient undertaking must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined.  Second, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner.  Third, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations.  Fourth, the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations.\n\n27\n\n\nIf the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph were not met, the State measure at issue would be deemed to confer a selective advantage on the recipient undertaking and if, moreover, the other criteria set out in Article 107(1) TFEU were met, that measure would constitute aid in principle incompatible with the internal market.\n\n28\n\n\nArticle 106(2) TFEU provides that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are to be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them and that the development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union.\n\n29\n\n\nAs is provided by case-law, the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU itself shows that exemptions to the Treaty rules are permitted provided that they are necessary for performance of the particular tasks assigned to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 54 and of 28 February 2013, Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas, C‑1/12, EU:C:2013:127, paragraph 106).\n\n30\n\n\nIn that regard, it is clear from the Court’s case-law that it is not necessary that the financial balance or economic viability of the undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest should be threatened.  It is sufficient that, in the absence of the rights at issue, it would not be possible for the undertaking to perform the particular tasks entrusted to it, or that maintenance of those rights is necessary to enable the holder of them to perform tasks of general economic interest which have been assigned to it under economically acceptable conditions (judgment of 15 November 2007, International Mail Spain, C‑162/06, EU:C:2007:681, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).\n\n31\n\n\nIn allowing derogations to be made from the general rules of the Treaty in certain circumstances, Article 106(2) TFEU seeks to reconcile the Member States’ interest in using certain undertakings, in particular in the public sector, as an instrument of economic or fiscal policy with the Union’s interest in ensuring compliance with the rules on competition and the preservation of the unity of the common market (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 55).\n\n32\n\n\nAs set out in paragraph 21 above, Viasat submits that the Commission was required to examine, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, whether meeting the second and the fourth Altmark conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n33\n\n\nIt must be pointed out in this connection that in order to assess a measure under Article 106(2) TFEU, the Commission is not required, contrary to what is claimed by the appellant, to examine whether the conditions laid down by the case-law in Altmark, in particular the second and fourth of those conditions, are met.\n\n34\n\n\nAs the General Court indeed held in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, verification of the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law occurs upstream, that is to say in the examination of the issue of whether the measures at issue must be characterised as State aid.  That issue must be resolved before the one which consists in examining, where necessary, if incompatible aid is nevertheless necessary to the performance of the tasks assigned to the recipient of the measure at issue, under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n35\n\n\nBy contrast, the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law are no longer to be applied where the Commission, having found that a measure must be characterised as aid, in particular in so far as the recipient undertaking is unable to pass the test of comparison with a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public-service requirements, examines whether that aid can be justified under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n36\n\nThat latter provision, which is supplemented by the Protocol (No. 26) on Services of General Interest (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 308) and, as regards the field at issue in the present case, by the Protocol (No. 29) on the System of Public Broadcasting in the Member States (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 312), cannot be interpreted in isolation having regard merely to its wording without also taking into account the additional information in those protocols.\n\n37\n\n\nThe finding in paragraph 35 of the present judgment is supported, as the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, by the wording of Protocol No. 29, which states that ‘the provisions of the Treaties shall be without prejudice to the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting and in so far as such funding is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of the public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and in so far as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Union to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest, while the realisation of the remit of that public service shall be taken into account.’\n\n38\n\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, the General Court therefore did not err in law when it held in the judgment under appeal that Article 106(2) TFEU does not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision.\n\n39\n\n\nThe first ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.\n\nThe second ground of appeal, alleging breach of Article 296 TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n40\n\n\nBy its second ground of appeal, Viasat takes issue with paragraphs 103 and 104 of the judgment under appeal on the ground that the General Court erred in law by rejecting its plea for annulment based on the Commission’s infringement in the contested decision of its obligation to state reasons under Article 296 TFEU.\n\n41\n\n\nViasat also alleges that the General Court failed to reply to the pleas raised in the application at first instance.\n42\n\n\nThe Commission contends that the second ground of appeal is in part inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n43\n\nIt is settled case-law that the statement of reasons required under Article 296 TFEU must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the competent Court of the European Union to exercise its jurisdiction to review legality (judgment of 29 September 2011, Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C‑521/09 P, EU:C:2011:620, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited).\n\n44\n\n\nIt must be observed in this connection that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the plea alleging a failure to state reasons in the contested decision by stating that ‘the fact that the contested decision does not mention the role of the second and fourth Altmark conditions in the assessment of the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market is not attributable to an error of reasoning on the part of the Commission or to a failure to state reasons vitiating the contested decision, but rather to the fact that that decision applies a different analytical framework from that which favours [Viasat]’.\n\n45\n\n\nAs Viasat has conceded, the contested decision would only be vitiated by a failure to state reasons if the Commission had been required to apply the analytical framework which, according to Viasat, results from Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n46\n\n\nHowever, it follows from paragraph 37 above that Article 106(2) TFEU did not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision. Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in holding that sufficient reasons were stated for the contested decision.\n\n47\n\n\nMoreover, as the Advocate General observed in point 58 of his Opinion, the complaint alleging a failure to respond to the pleas raised in the application at first instance is insufficiently developed for the other parties to the appeal to respond to or for the Court to rule on. Consequently, it is inadmissible.\n\n48\n\n\n Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected as in part inadmissible and in part unfounded.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.\n\nCosts\n\n50\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which apply to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n51\n\n\nSince the Commission and TV2 A/S have applied for costs and Viasat has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay their costs.\n\n52\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure, also applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those Rules, the Member States and institutions which intervene in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.\n\n53\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark, as an intervener before the General Court, is to bear its own costs.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal;\n\n\n2.\n\n\nOrders Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd to pay the costs incurred by the European Commission and TV2/Danmark A/S; \n\n\n3.\n\n\nDeclares that the Kingdom of Denmark is to bear its own costs.\n\n\nSilva de Lapuerta\n\nRegan\n\nBonichot\n\nArabadjiev\n\nFernlund\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 8 March 2017.\n\nA.

The action has been brought by [Viasat], which is a commercial broadcasting company active on the Danish market and a direct competitor of the Danish broadcasting company TV2/Danmark A/S (“TV2 A/S”).\n\n2.\n\n\nTV2 A/S was created in order to replace, for accounting and tax purposes as of 1 January 2003, the autonomous State undertaking [TV2], established in 1986, by the Lov No 335 om ændring af lov om radio-og fjernsynsvirksomhed ... [(Law No 335 amending the Law on Broadcasting Services) of 4 June 1986]. TV2 A/S is, as was its predecessor TV2, the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio (“DR”).\n\n3.\n\n\nTV2 A/S, like, previously, TV2, has a public-service mission to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes. These may be broadcast by means of radio equipment, in particular, satellite or cable systems. Rules governing the public-service obligations of TV2 A/S and TV2 are laid down by the Danish Minister for Culture.\n\n4.\n\n\nApart from the public broadcasters, commercial television broadcasters operate on the nationwide television broadcasting market in Denmark. These include, first, [Viasat] and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (“SBS”).\n\n5.\n\n\nTV2 was set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of DR, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers. The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike DR, TV2 would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.\n\n6.\n\n\nFollowing a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting AS/TvDanmark, another commercial broadcaster on the Danish market, the system for funding TV2 was examined by the Commission of the European Communities in its Decision 2004/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for [TV2] (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 1; “the TV2 I decision”). That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: licensing fees, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2 (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2 at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees for nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, “the measures concerned”). Lastly, the Commission’s investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2 to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2’s public-service programmes through those installations.\n\n7.\n\n\nAfter examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (now Article 107(1) TFEU). That conclusion was based on the finding that TV2’s funding system, which sought to compensate it for the cost of providing its public services, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [(C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415) (“the Altmark conditions”)].\n\n8.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission decided that the aid granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2, in the form of licence fees and the other measures described in the TV2 I decision, was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (now Article 106(2) TFEU), with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish Kroner (DKK) which it classified as overcompensation (recital 163 to and Article 1 of the TV2 I decision). It accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2 A/S (Article 2 of the TV2 I decision), which had in the meantime replaced TV2 (see paragraph 2 above).\n\n9.\n\n\nGiven that the recovery of aid referred to in Article 2 of the TV2 I decision rendered TV2 A/S insolvent, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission, by letter of 23 July 2004, of a planned recapitalisation of that company. That plan provided, so far as State-funded measures were concerned, for a capital injection of DKK 440 million, on the one hand, and the conversion into capital of a State loan of DKK 394 million, on the other. By its Decision C(2004) 3632 final of 6 October 2004, in State Aid Case No N 313/2004 relating to the recapitalisation of [TV2 A/S] (OJ 2005 C 172, p. 3; “the recapitalisation decision”), the Commission concluded that the two measures planned for TV2 A/S were “necessary to rebuild the capital which TV2 [A/S] need[ed], following its conversion into a limited company, to fulfil its public-service mission” (recital 53 of the recapitalisation decision). Consequently, the Commission decided that any element of State aid that might be connected with the planned recapitalisation of TV2 A/S was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (recital 55 to the recapitalisation decision).\n\n10.\n\n\nThe TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2 A/S (Case T‑309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T‑317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2 A/S, namely [Viasat] (Case T‑329/04) and SBS (Case T‑336/04).\n\n11.\n\n\nBy judgment of 22 October 2008in TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission [(T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457)], the Court annulled the TV2 I decision. [In paragraph 124 of that judgment], the Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that TV2’s public-service mission was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest ... It also found, however, several instances of illegality vitiating the TV2 I decision, which led, in short, to the annulment of that decision.\n\n12.\n\n\nThus, first, examining the question whether the measures concerned by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons for which it took advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, as State resources [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 160 to 167)]. Second, the Court found that the Commission’s examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the legal and economic considerations which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2. The TV2 I decision was, in consequence, vitiated by failure to state reasons on that point [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 224 to 233)]. Third, the Court held that the Commission’s conclusions on the examination of the compatibility of the aid in the light of Article 86(2) EC, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons. According to the Court, that inadequacy of the reasons stated was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the actual legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2 during the period under investigation [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 192, 197 to 203).\n\n13.\n\n\nThe recapitalisation decision was the subject of two actions for annulment, brought by SBS and by [Viasat]. By two orders delivered on 24 September 2009, the Court ruled that, in the light of the annulment of the TV2 I decision and the close link between the obligation to recover the aid resulting from that decision and the measures which are the subject of the recapitalisation decision, it was no longer necessary to rule on those cases [(orders of 24 September 2009, SBS TV and SBS Danish Television v Commission, T‑12/05, not published, EU:T:2009:357, and [of 24 September 2009,] Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, T‑16/05, not published, EU:T:2009:358)].\n\n14.\n\n\nFollowing the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned. On that occasion, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S and, furthermore, received observations from the third parties.\n\n15.\n\n\nThe Commission presented the result of its re-examination of the measures concerned in the contested decision, which is the subject of the present action and of another action brought by TV2 A/S [(TV2/Danmark v Commission, T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684)], in which the Court has delivered its judgment today.\n\n16.\n\n\nThe contested decision concerns the measures granted to TV2 between 1995 and 2002. However, in its analysis the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.\n\n17.\n\n\nIn the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU in favour of TV2 (recital 153 of the contested decision). First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources (recital 90 to the contested decision) and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, it concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions (recital 153 to the contested decision). However, whereas in the TV2 I decision it had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million was overcompensation incompatible with Article 86(2) EC, in the contested decision the Commission took the view that that sum was a capital buffer appropriate for TV2 A/S (recital 233 to the contested decision). In the operative part of the contested decision, it therefore declared as follows:\n\n“Article 1\n\nThe measures implemented by Denmark in favour of [TV2] between 1995 and 2002 in the form of the licence fee resources and other measures discussed in this Decision are compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 106(2) [TFEU].”’ \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n3\n\n\n By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 March 2012, Viasat sought annulment in part of the contested decision.\n\n4\n\n\nViasat claimed that the State aid granted to TV2 was incompatible with the internal market, raising two pleas in this connection. The first plea alleged an error of law committed by the Commission which, in assessing the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU, did not take into account the second and fourth Altmark conditions. The second plea alleged a failure by the Commission to fulfil its duty to state reasons in so far as that institution, without explaining the reasons for its decision, found that Article 106(2) TFEU applied in the present case, although the second and fourth Altmark conditions were not met.\n\n5\n\n\nBy the judgment under appeal, the General Court declared that it was unnecessary to adjudicate on the action, in so far as that action sought the annulment of the contested decision in that the Commission had found that the advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2 by the TV2 Fund amounted to State aid, and dismissed the action as to the remainder .\n\n6\n\n\n By its judgment of 24 September 2015, TV2/Danmark v Commission (T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684), the General Court, in an action brought by TV2, annulled the contested decision in so far as it had characterised as State Aid the advertising revenue received by TV2 for the years 1995 and 1996. \n\nThe forms of order sought\n\n7\n\n\n Viasat claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed its action and annul the contested decision, and order the Commission to pay the costs of the proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice; and\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, set aside judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the General Court for a decision and reserve the decision on costs. \n\n8\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs incurred at both instances. \n\n9\n\n\n The Kingdom of Denmark contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal.\n\n10\n\n\nTV2 A/S contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, dismiss the appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, maintain the effects of the judgment under appeal and of the contested decision; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs of TV2 A/S. \n\nThe request to reopen the oral procedure\n\n11\n\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Advocate General’s Opinion, Viasat, by letter of 3 January 2017, requested the Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure. In support of its request, Viasat submits that the Advocate General’s Opinion distorts some of its arguments and raises separate arguments which were not debated between the parties.\n\n12\n\n\nIt should be borne in mind that, according to Article 83 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that court may, at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n13\n\n\nHowever, the Statute and those Rules make no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk, C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).\n\n14\n\n\nIn that regard, it follows from the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU that it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which require his involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based. Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions examined in that Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraphs 60 and 61 and the case-law cited).\n\n15\n\n\nThe Court therefore considers, having heard the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary information to give judgment and that the information has been the subject of debate between the parties.\n\n16\n\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.\n\nThe appeal\n\nThe first plea, alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n17\n\n\nBy its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measures concerned in the light of the requirements set out in Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular those providing that, first, the application of the rules of the Treaties must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned and, secondly, the performance of those tasks must not affect the development of trade as would be contrary to the interests of the European Union, was not required to take into consideration the fact that those measures did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions. According to those conditions, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation for the performance of the public service is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner, and that compensation must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical and well run undertaking would have incurred in performing the public service tasks concerned.\n\n18\n\n\nViasat claims that it is apparent from the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU that the requirement that the application of the rules in the Treaties, in particular the competition rules, must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned must be interpreted so as to refer to the other provisions of the Treaty. Thus, in an assessment of the compatibility of State aid in the light of Article 106(2) TFEU, those other provisions must be examined beforehand. Therefore, in the present case it should, according to Viasat, have been ascertained in this connection whether or not the application of any of the Altmark conditions obstructed the performance of the public service tasks assigned to TV2. Had that examination taken place, the Commission would have concluded that the adoption, in favour of TV2, of measures meeting the second and fourth Altmark conditions would not have obstructed the performance of that task.\n\n19\n\n\nConsequently, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements that the performance of the tasks at issue must be obstructed and the development of trade cannot be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union, the Commission should have requested the Kingdom of Denmark to prove that complying with the second and fourth Altmark conditions would have prevented the performance of the tasks of general economic interest assigned to TV2. \n\n20\n\n\n The Commission, the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S contend that the first ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n21\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission was not required, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, to take the second and fourth Altmark conditions into consideration in order to ascertain whether compliance with those conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n22\n\n\nIn this connection it must be recalled that, for a national measure to be categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, there must, first, be an intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient and, fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).\n\n23\n\n\nSince those conditions are cumulative, a State measure cannot be characterised as State aid if one of them is not satisfied. By contrast, if all those conditions are met, that measure constitutes State aid and, accordingly, unless it is covered by a derogation provided for by the Treaties, is incompatible with the internal market.\n\n24\n\n\nSo far as concerns the third criterion for characterising a measure as State aid, it is settled case-law that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are regarded as State aid (see judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraph 34).\n\n25\n\n\nHowever, the Court has stated that, where a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations, so that those undertakings do not enjoy a real financial advantage and the measure thus does not have the effect of putting them in a more favourable competitive position than the undertakings competing with them, such a measure is not caught by Article 107(1) TFEU (see judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 87).\n\n26\n\n\nIn accordance with paragraphs 88 to 93 of the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), in order for such a measure not to be characterised as State aid a number of conditions must be met.  First, the recipient undertaking must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined.  Second, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner.  Third, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations.  Fourth, the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations.\n\n27\n\n\nIf the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph were not met, the State measure at issue would be deemed to confer a selective advantage on the recipient undertaking and if, moreover, the other criteria set out in Article 107(1) TFEU were met, that measure would constitute aid in principle incompatible with the internal market.\n\n28\n\n\nArticle 106(2) TFEU provides that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are to be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them and that the development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union.\n\n29\n\n\nAs is provided by case-law, the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU itself shows that exemptions to the Treaty rules are permitted provided that they are necessary for performance of the particular tasks assigned to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 54 and of 28 February 2013, Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas, C‑1/12, EU:C:2013:127, paragraph 106).\n\n30\n\n\nIn that regard, it is clear from the Court’s case-law that it is not necessary that the financial balance or economic viability of the undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest should be threatened.  It is sufficient that, in the absence of the rights at issue, it would not be possible for the undertaking to perform the particular tasks entrusted to it, or that maintenance of those rights is necessary to enable the holder of them to perform tasks of general economic interest which have been assigned to it under economically acceptable conditions (judgment of 15 November 2007, International Mail Spain, C‑162/06, EU:C:2007:681, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).\n\n31\n\n\nIn allowing derogations to be made from the general rules of the Treaty in certain circumstances, Article 106(2) TFEU seeks to reconcile the Member States’ interest in using certain undertakings, in particular in the public sector, as an instrument of economic or fiscal policy with the Union’s interest in ensuring compliance with the rules on competition and the preservation of the unity of the common market (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 55).\n\n32\n\n\nAs set out in paragraph 21 above, Viasat submits that the Commission was required to examine, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, whether meeting the second and the fourth Altmark conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n33\n\n\nIt must be pointed out in this connection that in order to assess a measure under Article 106(2) TFEU, the Commission is not required, contrary to what is claimed by the appellant, to examine whether the conditions laid down by the case-law in Altmark, in particular the second and fourth of those conditions, are met.\n\n34\n\n\nAs the General Court indeed held in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, verification of the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law occurs upstream, that is to say in the examination of the issue of whether the measures at issue must be characterised as State aid.  That issue must be resolved before the one which consists in examining, where necessary, if incompatible aid is nevertheless necessary to the performance of the tasks assigned to the recipient of the measure at issue, under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n35\n\n\nBy contrast, the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law are no longer to be applied where the Commission, having found that a measure must be characterised as aid, in particular in so far as the recipient undertaking is unable to pass the test of comparison with a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public-service requirements, examines whether that aid can be justified under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n36\n\nThat latter provision, which is supplemented by the Protocol (No. 26) on Services of General Interest (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 308) and, as regards the field at issue in the present case, by the Protocol (No. 29) on the System of Public Broadcasting in the Member States (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 312), cannot be interpreted in isolation having regard merely to its wording without also taking into account the additional information in those protocols.\n\n37\n\n\nThe finding in paragraph 35 of the present judgment is supported, as the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, by the wording of Protocol No. 29, which states that ‘the provisions of the Treaties shall be without prejudice to the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting and in so far as such funding is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of the public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and in so far as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Union to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest, while the realisation of the remit of that public service shall be taken into account.’\n\n38\n\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, the General Court therefore did not err in law when it held in the judgment under appeal that Article 106(2) TFEU does not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision.\n\n39\n\n\nThe first ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.\n\nThe second ground of appeal, alleging breach of Article 296 TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n40\n\n\nBy its second ground of appeal, Viasat takes issue with paragraphs 103 and 104 of the judgment under appeal on the ground that the General Court erred in law by rejecting its plea for annulment based on the Commission’s infringement in the contested decision of its obligation to state reasons under Article 296 TFEU.\n\n41\n\n\nViasat also alleges that the General Court failed to reply to the pleas raised in the application at first instance.\n42\n\n\nThe Commission contends that the second ground of appeal is in part inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n43\n\nIt is settled case-law that the statement of reasons required under Article 296 TFEU must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the competent Court of the European Union to exercise its jurisdiction to review legality (judgment of 29 September 2011, Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C‑521/09 P, EU:C:2011:620, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited).\n\n44\n\n\nIt must be observed in this connection that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the plea alleging a failure to state reasons in the contested decision by stating that ‘the fact that the contested decision does not mention the role of the second and fourth Altmark conditions in the assessment of the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market is not attributable to an error of reasoning on the part of the Commission or to a failure to state reasons vitiating the contested decision, but rather to the fact that that decision applies a different analytical framework from that which favours [Viasat]’.\n\n45\n\n\nAs Viasat has conceded, the contested decision would only be vitiated by a failure to state reasons if the Commission had been required to apply the analytical framework which, according to Viasat, results from Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n46\n\n\nHowever, it follows from paragraph 37 above that Article 106(2) TFEU did not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision. Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in holding that sufficient reasons were stated for the contested decision.\n\n47\n\n\nMoreover, as the Advocate General observed in point 58 of his Opinion, the complaint alleging a failure to respond to the pleas raised in the application at first instance is insufficiently developed for the other parties to the appeal to respond to or for the Court to rule on. Consequently, it is inadmissible.\n\n48\n\n\n Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected as in part inadmissible and in part unfounded.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.\n\nCosts\n\n50\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which apply to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n51\n\n\nSince the Commission and TV2 A/S have applied for costs and Viasat has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay their costs.\n\n52\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure, also applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those Rules, the Member States and institutions which intervene in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.\n\n53\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark, as an intervener before the General Court, is to bear its own costs.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal;\n\n\n2.\n\n\nOrders Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd to pay the costs incurred by the European Commission and TV2/Danmark A/S; \n\n\n3.\n\n\nDeclares that the Kingdom of Denmark is to bear its own costs.\n\n\nSilva de Lapuerta\n\nRegan\n\nBonichot\n\nArabadjiev\n\nFernlund\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 8 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\n after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 10 November 2016, \n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd (‘Viasat’) seeks to have set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 24 September 2015, Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission (T‑125/12, EU:T:2015:687) (‘the judgment under appeal’), by which that court dismissed its action directed against Commission Decision 2011/839/EU of 20 April 2011 on the measures implemented by Denmark (C 2/03) for TV2/Danmark (OJ 2011 L 340, p. 1) (‘the contested decision’), by which the European Commission, while recognising that certain measures adopted by the Kingdom of Denmark in favour of TV2/Danmark (‘TV2’) had the character of State aid, decided that those measures were to be regarded as compatible with the internal market on the basis of Article 106(2) TFEU. \n\n Background to the dispute\n\n2\n\n\nThe General Court set out the background to the dispute in paragraphs 1 to 17 of the judgment under appeal in the following terms:\n\n‘1.\n\n\nThe subject-matter of this action is a claim for annulment, in part, of [the contested decision] in that it finds that [the measures implemented by Denmark for TV2/Danmark], although amounting to State aid, are nevertheless compatible with the internal market, within the meaning of Article 106(2) TFEU. The action has been brought by [Viasat], which is a commercial broadcasting company active on the Danish market and a direct competitor of the Danish broadcasting company TV2/Danmark A/S (“TV2 A/S”).\n\n2.\n\n\nTV2 A/S was created in order to replace, for accounting and tax purposes as of 1 January 2003, the autonomous State undertaking [TV2], established in 1986, by the Lov No 335 om ændring af lov om radio-og fjernsynsvirksomhed ... [(Law No 335 amending the Law on Broadcasting Services) of 4 June 1986]. TV2 A/S is, as was its predecessor TV2, the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio (“DR”).\n\n3.\n\n\nTV2 A/S, like, previously, TV2, has a public-service mission to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes. These may be broadcast by means of radio equipment, in particular, satellite or cable systems. Rules governing the public-service obligations of TV2 A/S and TV2 are laid down by the Danish Minister for Culture.\n\n4.\n\n\nApart from the public broadcasters, commercial television broadcasters operate on the nationwide television broadcasting market in Denmark. These include, first, [Viasat] and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (“SBS”).\n\n5.\n\n\nTV2 was set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of DR, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers. The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike DR, TV2 would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.\n\n6.\n\n\nFollowing a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting AS/TvDanmark, another commercial broadcaster on the Danish market, the system for funding TV2 was examined by the Commission of the European Communities in its Decision 2004/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for [TV2] (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 1; “the TV2 I decision”). That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: licensing fees, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2 (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2 at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees for nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, “the measures concerned”). Lastly, the Commission’s investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2 to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2’s public-service programmes through those installations.\n\n7.\n\n\nAfter examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (now Article 107(1) TFEU). That conclusion was based on the finding that TV2’s funding system, which sought to compensate it for the cost of providing its public services, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [(C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415) (“the Altmark conditions”)].\n\n8.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission decided that the aid granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2, in the form of licence fees and the other measures described in the TV2 I decision, was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (now Article 106(2) TFEU), with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish Kroner (DKK) which it classified as overcompensation (recital 163 to and Article 1 of the TV2 I decision). It accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2 A/S (Article 2 of the TV2 I decision), which had in the meantime replaced TV2 (see paragraph 2 above).\n\n9.\n\n\nGiven that the recovery of aid referred to in Article 2 of the TV2 I decision rendered TV2 A/S insolvent, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission, by letter of 23 July 2004, of a planned recapitalisation of that company. That plan provided, so far as State-funded measures were concerned, for a capital injection of DKK 440 million, on the one hand, and the conversion into capital of a State loan of DKK 394 million, on the other. By its Decision C(2004) 3632 final of 6 October 2004, in State Aid Case No N 313/2004 relating to the recapitalisation of [TV2 A/S] (OJ 2005 C 172, p. 3; “the recapitalisation decision”), the Commission concluded that the two measures planned for TV2 A/S were “necessary to rebuild the capital which TV2 [A/S] need[ed], following its conversion into a limited company, to fulfil its public-service mission” (recital 53 of the recapitalisation decision). Consequently, the Commission decided that any element of State aid that might be connected with the planned recapitalisation of TV2 A/S was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (recital 55 to the recapitalisation decision).\n\n10.\n\n\nThe TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2 A/S (Case T‑309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T‑317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2 A/S, namely [Viasat] (Case T‑329/04) and SBS (Case T‑336/04).\n\n11.\n\n\nBy judgment of 22 October 2008in TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission [(T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457)], the Court annulled the TV2 I decision. [In paragraph 124 of that judgment], the Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that TV2’s public-service mission was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest ... It also found, however, several instances of illegality vitiating the TV2 I decision, which led, in short, to the annulment of that decision.\n\n12.\n\n\nThus, first, examining the question whether the measures concerned by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons for which it took advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, as State resources [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 160 to 167)]. Second, the Court found that the Commission’s examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the legal and economic considerations which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2. The TV2 I decision was, in consequence, vitiated by failure to state reasons on that point [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 224 to 233)]. Third, the Court held that the Commission’s conclusions on the examination of the compatibility of the aid in the light of Article 86(2) EC, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons. According to the Court, that inadequacy of the reasons stated was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the actual legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2 during the period under investigation [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 192, 197 to 203).\n\n13.\n\n\nThe recapitalisation decision was the subject of two actions for annulment, brought by SBS and by [Viasat]. By two orders delivered on 24 September 2009, the Court ruled that, in the light of the annulment of the TV2 I decision and the close link between the obligation to recover the aid resulting from that decision and the measures which are the subject of the recapitalisation decision, it was no longer necessary to rule on those cases [(orders of 24 September 2009, SBS TV and SBS Danish Television v Commission, T‑12/05, not published, EU:T:2009:357, and [of 24 September 2009,] Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, T‑16/05, not published, EU:T:2009:358)].\n\n14.\n\n\nFollowing the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned. On that occasion, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S and, furthermore, received observations from the third parties.\n\n15.\n\n\nThe Commission presented the result of its re-examination of the measures concerned in the contested decision, which is the subject of the present action and of another action brought by TV2 A/S [(TV2/Danmark v Commission, T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684)], in which the Court has delivered its judgment today.\n\n16.\n\n\nThe contested decision concerns the measures granted to TV2 between 1995 and 2002. However, in its analysis the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.\n\n17.\n\n\nIn the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU in favour of TV2 (recital 153 of the contested decision). First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources (recital 90 to the contested decision) and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, it concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions (recital 153 to the contested decision). However, whereas in the TV2 I decision it had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million was overcompensation incompatible with Article 86(2) EC, in the contested decision the Commission took the view that that sum was a capital buffer appropriate for TV2 A/S (recital 233 to the contested decision). In the operative part of the contested decision, it therefore declared as follows:\n\n“Article 1\n\nThe measures implemented by Denmark in favour of [TV2] between 1995 and 2002 in the form of the licence fee resources and other measures discussed in this Decision are compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 106(2) [TFEU].”’ \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n3\n\n\n By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 March 2012, Viasat sought annulment in part of the contested decision.\n\n4\n\n\nViasat claimed that the State aid granted to TV2 was incompatible with the internal market, raising two pleas in this connection. The first plea alleged an error of law committed by the Commission which, in assessing the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU, did not take into account the second and fourth Altmark conditions. The second plea alleged a failure by the Commission to fulfil its duty to state reasons in so far as that institution, without explaining the reasons for its decision, found that Article 106(2) TFEU applied in the present case, although the second and fourth Altmark conditions were not met.\n\n5\n\n\nBy the judgment under appeal, the General Court declared that it was unnecessary to adjudicate on the action, in so far as that action sought the annulment of the contested decision in that the Commission had found that the advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2 by the TV2 Fund amounted to State aid, and dismissed the action as to the remainder .\n\n6\n\n\n By its judgment of 24 September 2015, TV2/Danmark v Commission (T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684), the General Court, in an action brought by TV2, annulled the contested decision in so far as it had characterised as State Aid the advertising revenue received by TV2 for the years 1995 and 1996. \n\nThe forms of order sought\n\n7\n\n\n Viasat claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed its action and annul the contested decision, and order the Commission to pay the costs of the proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice; and\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, set aside judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the General Court for a decision and reserve the decision on costs. \n\n8\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs incurred at both instances. \n\n9\n\n\n The Kingdom of Denmark contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal.\n\n10\n\n\nTV2 A/S contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, dismiss the appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, maintain the effects of the judgment under appeal and of the contested decision; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs of TV2 A/S. \n\nThe request to reopen the oral procedure\n\n11\n\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Advocate General’s Opinion, Viasat, by letter of 3 January 2017, requested the Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure. In support of its request, Viasat submits that the Advocate General’s Opinion distorts some of its arguments and raises separate arguments which were not debated between the parties.\n\n12\n\n\nIt should be borne in mind that, according to Article 83 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that court may, at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n13\n\n\nHowever, the Statute and those Rules make no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk, C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).\n\n14\n\n\nIn that regard, it follows from the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU that it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which require his involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based. Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions examined in that Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraphs 60 and 61 and the case-law cited).\n\n15\n\n\nThe Court therefore considers, having heard the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary information to give judgment and that the information has been the subject of debate between the parties.\n\n16\n\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.\n\nThe appeal\n\nThe first plea, alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n17\n\n\nBy its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measures concerned in the light of the requirements set out in Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular those providing that, first, the application of the rules of the Treaties must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned and, secondly, the performance of those tasks must not affect the development of trade as would be contrary to the interests of the European Union, was not required to take into consideration the fact that those measures did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions. According to those conditions, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation for the performance of the public service is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner, and that compensation must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical and well run undertaking would have incurred in performing the public service tasks concerned.\n\n18\n\n\nViasat claims that it is apparent from the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU that the requirement that the application of the rules in the Treaties, in particular the competition rules, must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned must be interpreted so as to refer to the other provisions of the Treaty. Thus, in an assessment of the compatibility of State aid in the light of Article 106(2) TFEU, those other provisions must be examined beforehand. Therefore, in the present case it should, according to Viasat, have been ascertained in this connection whether or not the application of any of the Altmark conditions obstructed the performance of the public service tasks assigned to TV2. Had that examination taken place, the Commission would have concluded that the adoption, in favour of TV2, of measures meeting the second and fourth Altmark conditions would not have obstructed the performance of that task.\n\n19\n\n\nConsequently, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements that the performance of the tasks at issue must be obstructed and the development of trade cannot be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union, the Commission should have requested the Kingdom of Denmark to prove that complying with the second and fourth Altmark conditions would have prevented the performance of the tasks of general economic interest assigned to TV2. \n\n20\n\n\n The Commission, the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S contend that the first ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n21\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission was not required, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, to take the second and fourth Altmark conditions into consideration in order to ascertain whether compliance with those conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n22\n\n\nIn this connection it must be recalled that, for a national measure to be categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, there must, first, be an intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient and, fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).\n\n23\n\n\nSince those conditions are cumulative, a State measure cannot be characterised as State aid if one of them is not satisfied. By contrast, if all those conditions are met, that measure constitutes State aid and, accordingly, unless it is covered by a derogation provided for by the Treaties, is incompatible with the internal market.\n\n24\n\n\nSo far as concerns the third criterion for characterising a measure as State aid, it is settled case-law that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are regarded as State aid (see judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraph 34).\n\n25\n\n\nHowever, the Court has stated that, where a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations, so that those undertakings do not enjoy a real financial advantage and the measure thus does not have the effect of putting them in a more favourable competitive position than the undertakings competing with them, such a measure is not caught by Article 107(1) TFEU (see judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 87).\n\n26\n\n\nIn accordance with paragraphs 88 to 93 of the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), in order for such a measure not to be characterised as State aid a number of conditions must be met.  First, the recipient undertaking must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined.  Second, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner.  Third, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations.  Fourth, the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations.\n\n27\n\n\nIf the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph were not met, the State measure at issue would be deemed to confer a selective advantage on the recipient undertaking and if, moreover, the other criteria set out in Article 107(1) TFEU were met, that measure would constitute aid in principle incompatible with the internal market.\n\n28\n\n\nArticle 106(2) TFEU provides that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are to be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them and that the development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union.\n\n29\n\n\nAs is provided by case-law, the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU itself shows that exemptions to the Treaty rules are permitted provided that they are necessary for performance of the particular tasks assigned to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 54 and of 28 February 2013, Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas, C‑1/12, EU:C:2013:127, paragraph 106).\n\n30\n\n\nIn that regard, it is clear from the Court’s case-law that it is not necessary that the financial balance or economic viability of the undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest should be threatened.  It is sufficient that, in the absence of the rights at issue, it would not be possible for the undertaking to perform the particular tasks entrusted to it, or that maintenance of those rights is necessary to enable the holder of them to perform tasks of general economic interest which have been assigned to it under economically acceptable conditions (judgment of 15 November 2007, International Mail Spain, C‑162/06, EU:C:2007:681, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).\n\n31\n\n\nIn allowing derogations to be made from the general rules of the Treaty in certain circumstances, Article 106(2) TFEU seeks to reconcile the Member States’ interest in using certain undertakings, in particular in the public sector, as an instrument of economic or fiscal policy with the Union’s interest in ensuring compliance with the rules on competition and the preservation of the unity of the common market (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 55).\n\n32\n\n\nAs set out in paragraph 21 above, Viasat submits that the Commission was required to examine, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, whether meeting the second and the fourth Altmark conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n33\n\n\nIt must be pointed out in this connection that in order to assess a measure under Article 106(2) TFEU, the Commission is not required, contrary to what is claimed by the appellant, to examine whether the conditions laid down by the case-law in Altmark, in particular the second and fourth of those conditions, are met.\n\n34\n\n\nAs the General Court indeed held in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, verification of the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law occurs upstream, that is to say in the examination of the issue of whether the measures at issue must be characterised as State aid.  That issue must be resolved before the one which consists in examining, where necessary, if incompatible aid is nevertheless necessary to the performance of the tasks assigned to the recipient of the measure at issue, under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n35\n\n\nBy contrast, the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law are no longer to be applied where the Commission, having found that a measure must be characterised as aid, in particular in so far as the recipient undertaking is unable to pass the test of comparison with a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public-service requirements, examines whether that aid can be justified under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n36\n\nThat latter provision, which is supplemented by the Protocol (No. 26) on Services of General Interest (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 308) and, as regards the field at issue in the present case, by the Protocol (No. 29) on the System of Public Broadcasting in the Member States (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 312), cannot be interpreted in isolation having regard merely to its wording without also taking into account the additional information in those protocols.\n\n37\n\n\nThe finding in paragraph 35 of the present judgment is supported, as the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, by the wording of Protocol No. 29, which states that ‘the provisions of the Treaties shall be without prejudice to the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting and in so far as such funding is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of the public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and in so far as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Union to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest, while the realisation of the remit of that public service shall be taken into account.’\n\n38\n\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, the General Court therefore did not err in law when it held in the judgment under appeal that Article 106(2) TFEU does not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision.\n\n39\n\n\nThe first ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.\n\nThe second ground of appeal, alleging breach of Article 296 TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n40\n\n\nBy its second ground of appeal, Viasat takes issue with paragraphs 103 and 104 of the judgment under appeal on the ground that the General Court erred in law by rejecting its plea for annulment based on the Commission’s infringement in the contested decision of its obligation to state reasons under Article 296 TFEU.\n\n41\n\n\nViasat also alleges that the General Court failed to reply to the pleas raised in the application at first instance.\n42\n\n\nThe Commission contends that the second ground of appeal is in part inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n43\n\nIt is settled case-law that the statement of reasons required under Article 296 TFEU must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the competent Court of the European Union to exercise its jurisdiction to review legality (judgment of 29 September 2011, Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C‑521/09 P, EU:C:2011:620, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited).\n\n44\n\n\nIt must be observed in this connection that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the plea alleging a failure to state reasons in the contested decision by stating that ‘the fact that the contested decision does not mention the role of the second and fourth Altmark conditions in the assessment of the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market is not attributable to an error of reasoning on the part of the Commission or to a failure to state reasons vitiating the contested decision, but rather to the fact that that decision applies a different analytical framework from that which favours [Viasat]’.\n\n45\n\n\nAs Viasat has conceded, the contested decision would only be vitiated by a failure to state reasons if the Commission had been required to apply the analytical framework which, according to Viasat, results from Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n46\n\n\nHowever, it follows from paragraph 37 above that Article 106(2) TFEU did not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision. Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in holding that sufficient reasons were stated for the contested decision.\n\n47\n\n\nMoreover, as the Advocate General observed in point 58 of his Opinion, the complaint alleging a failure to respond to the pleas raised in the application at first instance is insufficiently developed for the other parties to the appeal to respond to or for the Court to rule on. Consequently, it is inadmissible.\n\n48\n\n\n Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected as in part inadmissible and in part unfounded.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.\n\nCosts\n\n50\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which apply to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n51\n\n\nSince the Commission and TV2 A/S have applied for costs and Viasat has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay their costs.\n\n52\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure, also applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those Rules, the Member States and institutions which intervene in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.\n\n53\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark, as an intervener before the General Court, is to bear its own costs.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal;\n\n\n2.\n\n\nOrders Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd to pay the costs incurred by the European Commission and TV2/Danmark A/S; \n\n\n3.\n\n\nDeclares that the Kingdom of Denmark is to bear its own costs.\n\n\nSilva de Lapuerta\n\nRegan\n\nBonichot\n\nArabadjiev\n\nFernlund\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 8 March 2017.\n\nA.

The action has been brought by [Viasat], which is a commercial broadcasting company active on the Danish market and a direct competitor of the Danish broadcasting company TV2/Danmark A/S (“TV2 A/S”).\n\n2.\n\n\nTV2 A/S was created in order to replace, for accounting and tax purposes as of 1 January 2003, the autonomous State undertaking [TV2], established in 1986, by the Lov No 335 om ændring af lov om radio-og fjernsynsvirksomhed ... [(Law No 335 amending the Law on Broadcasting Services) of 4 June 1986]. TV2 A/S is, as was its predecessor TV2, the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio (“DR”).\n\n3.\n\n\nTV2 A/S, like, previously, TV2, has a public-service mission to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes. These may be broadcast by means of radio equipment, in particular, satellite or cable systems. Rules governing the public-service obligations of TV2 A/S and TV2 are laid down by the Danish Minister for Culture.\n\n4.\n\n\nApart from the public broadcasters, commercial television broadcasters operate on the nationwide television broadcasting market in Denmark. These include, first, [Viasat] and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (“SBS”).\n\n5.\n\n\nTV2 was set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of DR, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers. The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike DR, TV2 would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.\n\n6.\n\n\nFollowing a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting AS/TvDanmark, another commercial broadcaster on the Danish market, the system for funding TV2 was examined by the Commission of the European Communities in its Decision 2004/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for [TV2] (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 1; “the TV2 I decision”). That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: licensing fees, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2 (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2 at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees for nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, “the measures concerned”). Lastly, the Commission’s investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2 to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2’s public-service programmes through those installations.\n\n7.\n\n\nAfter examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (now Article 107(1) TFEU). That conclusion was based on the finding that TV2’s funding system, which sought to compensate it for the cost of providing its public services, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [(C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415) (“the Altmark conditions”)].\n\n8.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission decided that the aid granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2, in the form of licence fees and the other measures described in the TV2 I decision, was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (now Article 106(2) TFEU), with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish Kroner (DKK) which it classified as overcompensation (recital 163 to and Article 1 of the TV2 I decision). It accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2 A/S (Article 2 of the TV2 I decision), which had in the meantime replaced TV2 (see paragraph 2 above).\n\n9.\n\n\nGiven that the recovery of aid referred to in Article 2 of the TV2 I decision rendered TV2 A/S insolvent, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission, by letter of 23 July 2004, of a planned recapitalisation of that company. That plan provided, so far as State-funded measures were concerned, for a capital injection of DKK 440 million, on the one hand, and the conversion into capital of a State loan of DKK 394 million, on the other. By its Decision C(2004) 3632 final of 6 October 2004, in State Aid Case No N 313/2004 relating to the recapitalisation of [TV2 A/S] (OJ 2005 C 172, p. 3; “the recapitalisation decision”), the Commission concluded that the two measures planned for TV2 A/S were “necessary to rebuild the capital which TV2 [A/S] need[ed], following its conversion into a limited company, to fulfil its public-service mission” (recital 53 of the recapitalisation decision). Consequently, the Commission decided that any element of State aid that might be connected with the planned recapitalisation of TV2 A/S was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (recital 55 to the recapitalisation decision).\n\n10.\n\n\nThe TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2 A/S (Case T‑309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T‑317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2 A/S, namely [Viasat] (Case T‑329/04) and SBS (Case T‑336/04).\n\n11.\n\n\nBy judgment of 22 October 2008in TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission [(T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457)], the Court annulled the TV2 I decision. [In paragraph 124 of that judgment], the Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that TV2’s public-service mission was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest ... It also found, however, several instances of illegality vitiating the TV2 I decision, which led, in short, to the annulment of that decision.\n\n12.\n\n\nThus, first, examining the question whether the measures concerned by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons for which it took advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, as State resources [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 160 to 167)]. Second, the Court found that the Commission’s examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the legal and economic considerations which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2. The TV2 I decision was, in consequence, vitiated by failure to state reasons on that point [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 224 to 233)]. Third, the Court held that the Commission’s conclusions on the examination of the compatibility of the aid in the light of Article 86(2) EC, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons. According to the Court, that inadequacy of the reasons stated was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the actual legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2 during the period under investigation [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 192, 197 to 203).\n\n13.\n\n\nThe recapitalisation decision was the subject of two actions for annulment, brought by SBS and by [Viasat]. By two orders delivered on 24 September 2009, the Court ruled that, in the light of the annulment of the TV2 I decision and the close link between the obligation to recover the aid resulting from that decision and the measures which are the subject of the recapitalisation decision, it was no longer necessary to rule on those cases [(orders of 24 September 2009, SBS TV and SBS Danish Television v Commission, T‑12/05, not published, EU:T:2009:357, and [of 24 September 2009,] Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, T‑16/05, not published, EU:T:2009:358)].\n\n14.\n\n\nFollowing the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned. On that occasion, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S and, furthermore, received observations from the third parties.\n\n15.\n\n\nThe Commission presented the result of its re-examination of the measures concerned in the contested decision, which is the subject of the present action and of another action brought by TV2 A/S [(TV2/Danmark v Commission, T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684)], in which the Court has delivered its judgment today.\n\n16.\n\n\nThe contested decision concerns the measures granted to TV2 between 1995 and 2002. However, in its analysis the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.\n\n17.\n\n\nIn the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU in favour of TV2 (recital 153 of the contested decision). First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources (recital 90 to the contested decision) and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, it concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions (recital 153 to the contested decision). However, whereas in the TV2 I decision it had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million was overcompensation incompatible with Article 86(2) EC, in the contested decision the Commission took the view that that sum was a capital buffer appropriate for TV2 A/S (recital 233 to the contested decision). In the operative part of the contested decision, it therefore declared as follows:\n\n“Article 1\n\nThe measures implemented by Denmark in favour of [TV2] between 1995 and 2002 in the form of the licence fee resources and other measures discussed in this Decision are compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 106(2) [TFEU].”’ \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n3\n\n\n By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 March 2012, Viasat sought annulment in part of the contested decision.\n\n4\n\n\nViasat claimed that the State aid granted to TV2 was incompatible with the internal market, raising two pleas in this connection. The first plea alleged an error of law committed by the Commission which, in assessing the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU, did not take into account the second and fourth Altmark conditions. The second plea alleged a failure by the Commission to fulfil its duty to state reasons in so far as that institution, without explaining the reasons for its decision, found that Article 106(2) TFEU applied in the present case, although the second and fourth Altmark conditions were not met.\n\n5\n\n\nBy the judgment under appeal, the General Court declared that it was unnecessary to adjudicate on the action, in so far as that action sought the annulment of the contested decision in that the Commission had found that the advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2 by the TV2 Fund amounted to State aid, and dismissed the action as to the remainder .\n\n6\n\n\n By its judgment of 24 September 2015, TV2/Danmark v Commission (T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684), the General Court, in an action brought by TV2, annulled the contested decision in so far as it had characterised as State Aid the advertising revenue received by TV2 for the years 1995 and 1996. \n\nThe forms of order sought\n\n7\n\n\n Viasat claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed its action and annul the contested decision, and order the Commission to pay the costs of the proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice; and\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, set aside judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the General Court for a decision and reserve the decision on costs. \n\n8\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs incurred at both instances. \n\n9\n\n\n The Kingdom of Denmark contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal.\n\n10\n\n\nTV2 A/S contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, dismiss the appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, maintain the effects of the judgment under appeal and of the contested decision; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs of TV2 A/S. \n\nThe request to reopen the oral procedure\n\n11\n\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Advocate General’s Opinion, Viasat, by letter of 3 January 2017, requested the Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure. In support of its request, Viasat submits that the Advocate General’s Opinion distorts some of its arguments and raises separate arguments which were not debated between the parties.\n\n12\n\n\nIt should be borne in mind that, according to Article 83 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that court may, at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n13\n\n\nHowever, the Statute and those Rules make no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk, C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).\n\n14\n\n\nIn that regard, it follows from the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU that it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which require his involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based. Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions examined in that Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraphs 60 and 61 and the case-law cited).\n\n15\n\n\nThe Court therefore considers, having heard the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary information to give judgment and that the information has been the subject of debate between the parties.\n\n16\n\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.\n\nThe appeal\n\nThe first plea, alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n17\n\n\nBy its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measures concerned in the light of the requirements set out in Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular those providing that, first, the application of the rules of the Treaties must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned and, secondly, the performance of those tasks must not affect the development of trade as would be contrary to the interests of the European Union, was not required to take into consideration the fact that those measures did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions. According to those conditions, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation for the performance of the public service is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner, and that compensation must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical and well run undertaking would have incurred in performing the public service tasks concerned.\n\n18\n\n\nViasat claims that it is apparent from the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU that the requirement that the application of the rules in the Treaties, in particular the competition rules, must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned must be interpreted so as to refer to the other provisions of the Treaty. Thus, in an assessment of the compatibility of State aid in the light of Article 106(2) TFEU, those other provisions must be examined beforehand. Therefore, in the present case it should, according to Viasat, have been ascertained in this connection whether or not the application of any of the Altmark conditions obstructed the performance of the public service tasks assigned to TV2. Had that examination taken place, the Commission would have concluded that the adoption, in favour of TV2, of measures meeting the second and fourth Altmark conditions would not have obstructed the performance of that task.\n\n19\n\n\nConsequently, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements that the performance of the tasks at issue must be obstructed and the development of trade cannot be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union, the Commission should have requested the Kingdom of Denmark to prove that complying with the second and fourth Altmark conditions would have prevented the performance of the tasks of general economic interest assigned to TV2. \n\n20\n\n\n The Commission, the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S contend that the first ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n21\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission was not required, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, to take the second and fourth Altmark conditions into consideration in order to ascertain whether compliance with those conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n22\n\n\nIn this connection it must be recalled that, for a national measure to be categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, there must, first, be an intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient and, fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).\n\n23\n\n\nSince those conditions are cumulative, a State measure cannot be characterised as State aid if one of them is not satisfied. By contrast, if all those conditions are met, that measure constitutes State aid and, accordingly, unless it is covered by a derogation provided for by the Treaties, is incompatible with the internal market.\n\n24\n\n\nSo far as concerns the third criterion for characterising a measure as State aid, it is settled case-law that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are regarded as State aid (see judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraph 34).\n\n25\n\n\nHowever, the Court has stated that, where a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations, so that those undertakings do not enjoy a real financial advantage and the measure thus does not have the effect of putting them in a more favourable competitive position than the undertakings competing with them, such a measure is not caught by Article 107(1) TFEU (see judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 87).\n\n26\n\n\nIn accordance with paragraphs 88 to 93 of the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), in order for such a measure not to be characterised as State aid a number of conditions must be met.  First, the recipient undertaking must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined.  Second, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner.  Third, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations.  Fourth, the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations.\n\n27\n\n\nIf the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph were not met, the State measure at issue would be deemed to confer a selective advantage on the recipient undertaking and if, moreover, the other criteria set out in Article 107(1) TFEU were met, that measure would constitute aid in principle incompatible with the internal market.\n\n28\n\n\nArticle 106(2) TFEU provides that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are to be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them and that the development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union.\n\n29\n\n\nAs is provided by case-law, the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU itself shows that exemptions to the Treaty rules are permitted provided that they are necessary for performance of the particular tasks assigned to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 54 and of 28 February 2013, Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas, C‑1/12, EU:C:2013:127, paragraph 106).\n\n30\n\n\nIn that regard, it is clear from the Court’s case-law that it is not necessary that the financial balance or economic viability of the undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest should be threatened.  It is sufficient that, in the absence of the rights at issue, it would not be possible for the undertaking to perform the particular tasks entrusted to it, or that maintenance of those rights is necessary to enable the holder of them to perform tasks of general economic interest which have been assigned to it under economically acceptable conditions (judgment of 15 November 2007, International Mail Spain, C‑162/06, EU:C:2007:681, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).\n\n31\n\n\nIn allowing derogations to be made from the general rules of the Treaty in certain circumstances, Article 106(2) TFEU seeks to reconcile the Member States’ interest in using certain undertakings, in particular in the public sector, as an instrument of economic or fiscal policy with the Union’s interest in ensuring compliance with the rules on competition and the preservation of the unity of the common market (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 55).\n\n32\n\n\nAs set out in paragraph 21 above, Viasat submits that the Commission was required to examine, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, whether meeting the second and the fourth Altmark conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n33\n\n\nIt must be pointed out in this connection that in order to assess a measure under Article 106(2) TFEU, the Commission is not required, contrary to what is claimed by the appellant, to examine whether the conditions laid down by the case-law in Altmark, in particular the second and fourth of those conditions, are met.\n\n34\n\n\nAs the General Court indeed held in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, verification of the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law occurs upstream, that is to say in the examination of the issue of whether the measures at issue must be characterised as State aid.  That issue must be resolved before the one which consists in examining, where necessary, if incompatible aid is nevertheless necessary to the performance of the tasks assigned to the recipient of the measure at issue, under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n35\n\n\nBy contrast, the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law are no longer to be applied where the Commission, having found that a measure must be characterised as aid, in particular in so far as the recipient undertaking is unable to pass the test of comparison with a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public-service requirements, examines whether that aid can be justified under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n36\n\nThat latter provision, which is supplemented by the Protocol (No. 26) on Services of General Interest (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 308) and, as regards the field at issue in the present case, by the Protocol (No. 29) on the System of Public Broadcasting in the Member States (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 312), cannot be interpreted in isolation having regard merely to its wording without also taking into account the additional information in those protocols.\n\n37\n\n\nThe finding in paragraph 35 of the present judgment is supported, as the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, by the wording of Protocol No. 29, which states that ‘the provisions of the Treaties shall be without prejudice to the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting and in so far as such funding is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of the public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and in so far as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Union to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest, while the realisation of the remit of that public service shall be taken into account.’\n\n38\n\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, the General Court therefore did not err in law when it held in the judgment under appeal that Article 106(2) TFEU does not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision.\n\n39\n\n\nThe first ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.\n\nThe second ground of appeal, alleging breach of Article 296 TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n40\n\n\nBy its second ground of appeal, Viasat takes issue with paragraphs 103 and 104 of the judgment under appeal on the ground that the General Court erred in law by rejecting its plea for annulment based on the Commission’s infringement in the contested decision of its obligation to state reasons under Article 296 TFEU.\n\n41\n\n\nViasat also alleges that the General Court failed to reply to the pleas raised in the application at first instance.\n42\n\n\nThe Commission contends that the second ground of appeal is in part inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n43\n\nIt is settled case-law that the statement of reasons required under Article 296 TFEU must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the competent Court of the European Union to exercise its jurisdiction to review legality (judgment of 29 September 2011, Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C‑521/09 P, EU:C:2011:620, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited).\n\n44\n\n\nIt must be observed in this connection that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the plea alleging a failure to state reasons in the contested decision by stating that ‘the fact that the contested decision does not mention the role of the second and fourth Altmark conditions in the assessment of the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market is not attributable to an error of reasoning on the part of the Commission or to a failure to state reasons vitiating the contested decision, but rather to the fact that that decision applies a different analytical framework from that which favours [Viasat]’.\n\n45\n\n\nAs Viasat has conceded, the contested decision would only be vitiated by a failure to state reasons if the Commission had been required to apply the analytical framework which, according to Viasat, results from Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n46\n\n\nHowever, it follows from paragraph 37 above that Article 106(2) TFEU did not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision. Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in holding that sufficient reasons were stated for the contested decision.\n\n47\n\n\nMoreover, as the Advocate General observed in point 58 of his Opinion, the complaint alleging a failure to respond to the pleas raised in the application at first instance is insufficiently developed for the other parties to the appeal to respond to or for the Court to rule on. Consequently, it is inadmissible.\n\n48\n\n\n Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected as in part inadmissible and in part unfounded.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.\n\nCosts\n\n50\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which apply to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n51\n\n\nSince the Commission and TV2 A/S have applied for costs and Viasat has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay their costs.\n\n52\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure, also applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those Rules, the Member States and institutions which intervene in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.\n\n53\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark, as an intervener before the General Court, is to bear its own costs.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal;\n\n\n2.\n\n\nOrders Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd to pay the costs incurred by the European Commission and TV2/Danmark A/S; \n\n\n3.\n\n\nDeclares that the Kingdom of Denmark is to bear its own costs.\n\n\nSilva de Lapuerta\n\nRegan\n\nBonichot\n\nArabadjiev\n\nFernlund\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 8 March 2017.\n\nA.

The action has been brought by [Viasat], which is a commercial broadcasting company active on the Danish market and a direct competitor of the Danish broadcasting company TV2/Danmark A/S (“TV2 A/S”).\n\n2.\n\n\nTV2 A/S was created in order to replace, for accounting and tax purposes as of 1 January 2003, the autonomous State undertaking [TV2], established in 1986, by the Lov No 335 om ændring af lov om radio-og fjernsynsvirksomhed ... [(Law No 335 amending the Law on Broadcasting Services) of 4 June 1986]. TV2 A/S is, as was its predecessor TV2, the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio (“DR”).\n\n3.\n\n\nTV2 A/S, like, previously, TV2, has a public-service mission to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes. These may be broadcast by means of radio equipment, in particular, satellite or cable systems. Rules governing the public-service obligations of TV2 A/S and TV2 are laid down by the Danish Minister for Culture.\n\n4.\n\n\nApart from the public broadcasters, commercial television broadcasters operate on the nationwide television broadcasting market in Denmark. These include, first, [Viasat] and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (“SBS”).\n\n5.\n\n\nTV2 was set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of DR, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers. The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike DR, TV2 would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.\n\n6.\n\n\nFollowing a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting AS/TvDanmark, another commercial broadcaster on the Danish market, the system for funding TV2 was examined by the Commission of the European Communities in its Decision 2004/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for [TV2] (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 1; “the TV2 I decision”). That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: licensing fees, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2 (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2 at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees for nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, “the measures concerned”). Lastly, the Commission’s investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2 to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2’s public-service programmes through those installations.\n\n7.\n\n\nAfter examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (now Article 107(1) TFEU). That conclusion was based on the finding that TV2’s funding system, which sought to compensate it for the cost of providing its public services, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [(C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415) (“the Altmark conditions”)].\n\n8.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission decided that the aid granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2, in the form of licence fees and the other measures described in the TV2 I decision, was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (now Article 106(2) TFEU), with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish Kroner (DKK) which it classified as overcompensation (recital 163 to and Article 1 of the TV2 I decision). It accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2 A/S (Article 2 of the TV2 I decision), which had in the meantime replaced TV2 (see paragraph 2 above).\n\n9.\n\n\nGiven that the recovery of aid referred to in Article 2 of the TV2 I decision rendered TV2 A/S insolvent, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission, by letter of 23 July 2004, of a planned recapitalisation of that company. That plan provided, so far as State-funded measures were concerned, for a capital injection of DKK 440 million, on the one hand, and the conversion into capital of a State loan of DKK 394 million, on the other. By its Decision C(2004) 3632 final of 6 October 2004, in State Aid Case No N 313/2004 relating to the recapitalisation of [TV2 A/S] (OJ 2005 C 172, p. 3; “the recapitalisation decision”), the Commission concluded that the two measures planned for TV2 A/S were “necessary to rebuild the capital which TV2 [A/S] need[ed], following its conversion into a limited company, to fulfil its public-service mission” (recital 53 of the recapitalisation decision). Consequently, the Commission decided that any element of State aid that might be connected with the planned recapitalisation of TV2 A/S was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (recital 55 to the recapitalisation decision).\n\n10.\n\n\nThe TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2 A/S (Case T‑309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T‑317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2 A/S, namely [Viasat] (Case T‑329/04) and SBS (Case T‑336/04).\n\n11.\n\n\nBy judgment of 22 October 2008in TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission [(T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457)], the Court annulled the TV2 I decision. [In paragraph 124 of that judgment], the Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that TV2’s public-service mission was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest ... It also found, however, several instances of illegality vitiating the TV2 I decision, which led, in short, to the annulment of that decision.\n\n12.\n\n\nThus, first, examining the question whether the measures concerned by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons for which it took advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, as State resources [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 160 to 167)]. Second, the Court found that the Commission’s examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the legal and economic considerations which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2. The TV2 I decision was, in consequence, vitiated by failure to state reasons on that point [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 224 to 233)]. Third, the Court held that the Commission’s conclusions on the examination of the compatibility of the aid in the light of Article 86(2) EC, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons. According to the Court, that inadequacy of the reasons stated was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the actual legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2 during the period under investigation [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 192, 197 to 203).\n\n13.\n\n\nThe recapitalisation decision was the subject of two actions for annulment, brought by SBS and by [Viasat]. By two orders delivered on 24 September 2009, the Court ruled that, in the light of the annulment of the TV2 I decision and the close link between the obligation to recover the aid resulting from that decision and the measures which are the subject of the recapitalisation decision, it was no longer necessary to rule on those cases [(orders of 24 September 2009, SBS TV and SBS Danish Television v Commission, T‑12/05, not published, EU:T:2009:357, and [of 24 September 2009,] Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, T‑16/05, not published, EU:T:2009:358)].\n\n14.\n\n\nFollowing the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned. On that occasion, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S and, furthermore, received observations from the third parties.\n\n15.\n\n\nThe Commission presented the result of its re-examination of the measures concerned in the contested decision, which is the subject of the present action and of another action brought by TV2 A/S [(TV2/Danmark v Commission, T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684)], in which the Court has delivered its judgment today.\n\n16.\n\n\nThe contested decision concerns the measures granted to TV2 between 1995 and 2002. However, in its analysis the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.\n\n17.\n\n\nIn the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU in favour of TV2 (recital 153 of the contested decision). First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources (recital 90 to the contested decision) and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, it concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions (recital 153 to the contested decision). However, whereas in the TV2 I decision it had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million was overcompensation incompatible with Article 86(2) EC, in the contested decision the Commission took the view that that sum was a capital buffer appropriate for TV2 A/S (recital 233 to the contested decision). In the operative part of the contested decision, it therefore declared as follows:\n\n“Article 1\n\nThe measures implemented by Denmark in favour of [TV2] between 1995 and 2002 in the form of the licence fee resources and other measures discussed in this Decision are compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 106(2) [TFEU].”’ \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n3\n\n\n By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 March 2012, Viasat sought annulment in part of the contested decision.\n\n4\n\n\nViasat claimed that the State aid granted to TV2 was incompatible with the internal market, raising two pleas in this connection. The first plea alleged an error of law committed by the Commission which, in assessing the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU, did not take into account the second and fourth Altmark conditions. The second plea alleged a failure by the Commission to fulfil its duty to state reasons in so far as that institution, without explaining the reasons for its decision, found that Article 106(2) TFEU applied in the present case, although the second and fourth Altmark conditions were not met.\n\n5\n\n\nBy the judgment under appeal, the General Court declared that it was unnecessary to adjudicate on the action, in so far as that action sought the annulment of the contested decision in that the Commission had found that the advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2 by the TV2 Fund amounted to State aid, and dismissed the action as to the remainder .\n\n6\n\n\n By its judgment of 24 September 2015, TV2/Danmark v Commission (T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684), the General Court, in an action brought by TV2, annulled the contested decision in so far as it had characterised as State Aid the advertising revenue received by TV2 for the years 1995 and 1996. \n\nThe forms of order sought\n\n7\n\n\n Viasat claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed its action and annul the contested decision, and order the Commission to pay the costs of the proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice; and\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, set aside judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the General Court for a decision and reserve the decision on costs. \n\n8\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs incurred at both instances. \n\n9\n\n\n The Kingdom of Denmark contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal.\n\n10\n\n\nTV2 A/S contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, dismiss the appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, maintain the effects of the judgment under appeal and of the contested decision; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs of TV2 A/S. \n\nThe request to reopen the oral procedure\n\n11\n\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Advocate General’s Opinion, Viasat, by letter of 3 January 2017, requested the Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure. In support of its request, Viasat submits that the Advocate General’s Opinion distorts some of its arguments and raises separate arguments which were not debated between the parties.\n\n12\n\n\nIt should be borne in mind that, according to Article 83 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that court may, at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n13\n\n\nHowever, the Statute and those Rules make no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk, C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).\n\n14\n\n\nIn that regard, it follows from the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU that it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which require his involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based. Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions examined in that Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraphs 60 and 61 and the case-law cited).\n\n15\n\n\nThe Court therefore considers, having heard the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary information to give judgment and that the information has been the subject of debate between the parties.\n\n16\n\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.\n\nThe appeal\n\nThe first plea, alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n17\n\n\nBy its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measures concerned in the light of the requirements set out in Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular those providing that, first, the application of the rules of the Treaties must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned and, secondly, the performance of those tasks must not affect the development of trade as would be contrary to the interests of the European Union, was not required to take into consideration the fact that those measures did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions. According to those conditions, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation for the performance of the public service is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner, and that compensation must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical and well run undertaking would have incurred in performing the public service tasks concerned.\n\n18\n\n\nViasat claims that it is apparent from the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU that the requirement that the application of the rules in the Treaties, in particular the competition rules, must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned must be interpreted so as to refer to the other provisions of the Treaty. Thus, in an assessment of the compatibility of State aid in the light of Article 106(2) TFEU, those other provisions must be examined beforehand. Therefore, in the present case it should, according to Viasat, have been ascertained in this connection whether or not the application of any of the Altmark conditions obstructed the performance of the public service tasks assigned to TV2. Had that examination taken place, the Commission would have concluded that the adoption, in favour of TV2, of measures meeting the second and fourth Altmark conditions would not have obstructed the performance of that task.\n\n19\n\n\nConsequently, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements that the performance of the tasks at issue must be obstructed and the development of trade cannot be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union, the Commission should have requested the Kingdom of Denmark to prove that complying with the second and fourth Altmark conditions would have prevented the performance of the tasks of general economic interest assigned to TV2. \n\n20\n\n\n The Commission, the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S contend that the first ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n21\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission was not required, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, to take the second and fourth Altmark conditions into consideration in order to ascertain whether compliance with those conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n22\n\n\nIn this connection it must be recalled that, for a national measure to be categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, there must, first, be an intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient and, fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).\n\n23\n\n\nSince those conditions are cumulative, a State measure cannot be characterised as State aid if one of them is not satisfied. By contrast, if all those conditions are met, that measure constitutes State aid and, accordingly, unless it is covered by a derogation provided for by the Treaties, is incompatible with the internal market.\n\n24\n\n\nSo far as concerns the third criterion for characterising a measure as State aid, it is settled case-law that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are regarded as State aid (see judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraph 34).\n\n25\n\n\nHowever, the Court has stated that, where a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations, so that those undertakings do not enjoy a real financial advantage and the measure thus does not have the effect of putting them in a more favourable competitive position than the undertakings competing with them, such a measure is not caught by Article 107(1) TFEU (see judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 87).\n\n26\n\n\nIn accordance with paragraphs 88 to 93 of the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), in order for such a measure not to be characterised as State aid a number of conditions must be met.  First, the recipient undertaking must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined.  Second, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner.  Third, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations.  Fourth, the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations.\n\n27\n\n\nIf the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph were not met, the State measure at issue would be deemed to confer a selective advantage on the recipient undertaking and if, moreover, the other criteria set out in Article 107(1) TFEU were met, that measure would constitute aid in principle incompatible with the internal market.\n\n28\n\n\nArticle 106(2) TFEU provides that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are to be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them and that the development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union.\n\n29\n\n\nAs is provided by case-law, the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU itself shows that exemptions to the Treaty rules are permitted provided that they are necessary for performance of the particular tasks assigned to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 54 and of 28 February 2013, Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas, C‑1/12, EU:C:2013:127, paragraph 106).\n\n30\n\n\nIn that regard, it is clear from the Court’s case-law that it is not necessary that the financial balance or economic viability of the undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest should be threatened.  It is sufficient that, in the absence of the rights at issue, it would not be possible for the undertaking to perform the particular tasks entrusted to it, or that maintenance of those rights is necessary to enable the holder of them to perform tasks of general economic interest which have been assigned to it under economically acceptable conditions (judgment of 15 November 2007, International Mail Spain, C‑162/06, EU:C:2007:681, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).\n\n31\n\n\nIn allowing derogations to be made from the general rules of the Treaty in certain circumstances, Article 106(2) TFEU seeks to reconcile the Member States’ interest in using certain undertakings, in particular in the public sector, as an instrument of economic or fiscal policy with the Union’s interest in ensuring compliance with the rules on competition and the preservation of the unity of the common market (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 55).\n\n32\n\n\nAs set out in paragraph 21 above, Viasat submits that the Commission was required to examine, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, whether meeting the second and the fourth Altmark conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n33\n\n\nIt must be pointed out in this connection that in order to assess a measure under Article 106(2) TFEU, the Commission is not required, contrary to what is claimed by the appellant, to examine whether the conditions laid down by the case-law in Altmark, in particular the second and fourth of those conditions, are met.\n\n34\n\n\nAs the General Court indeed held in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, verification of the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law occurs upstream, that is to say in the examination of the issue of whether the measures at issue must be characterised as State aid.  That issue must be resolved before the one which consists in examining, where necessary, if incompatible aid is nevertheless necessary to the performance of the tasks assigned to the recipient of the measure at issue, under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n35\n\n\nBy contrast, the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law are no longer to be applied where the Commission, having found that a measure must be characterised as aid, in particular in so far as the recipient undertaking is unable to pass the test of comparison with a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public-service requirements, examines whether that aid can be justified under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n36\n\nThat latter provision, which is supplemented by the Protocol (No. 26) on Services of General Interest (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 308) and, as regards the field at issue in the present case, by the Protocol (No. 29) on the System of Public Broadcasting in the Member States (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 312), cannot be interpreted in isolation having regard merely to its wording without also taking into account the additional information in those protocols.\n\n37\n\n\nThe finding in paragraph 35 of the present judgment is supported, as the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, by the wording of Protocol No. 29, which states that ‘the provisions of the Treaties shall be without prejudice to the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting and in so far as such funding is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of the public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and in so far as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Union to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest, while the realisation of the remit of that public service shall be taken into account.’\n\n38\n\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, the General Court therefore did not err in law when it held in the judgment under appeal that Article 106(2) TFEU does not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision.\n\n39\n\n\nThe first ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.\n\nThe second ground of appeal, alleging breach of Article 296 TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n40\n\n\nBy its second ground of appeal, Viasat takes issue with paragraphs 103 and 104 of the judgment under appeal on the ground that the General Court erred in law by rejecting its plea for annulment based on the Commission’s infringement in the contested decision of its obligation to state reasons under Article 296 TFEU.\n\n41\n\n\nViasat also alleges that the General Court failed to reply to the pleas raised in the application at first instance.\n42\n\n\nThe Commission contends that the second ground of appeal is in part inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n43\n\nIt is settled case-law that the statement of reasons required under Article 296 TFEU must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the competent Court of the European Union to exercise its jurisdiction to review legality (judgment of 29 September 2011, Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C‑521/09 P, EU:C:2011:620, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited).\n\n44\n\n\nIt must be observed in this connection that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the plea alleging a failure to state reasons in the contested decision by stating that ‘the fact that the contested decision does not mention the role of the second and fourth Altmark conditions in the assessment of the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market is not attributable to an error of reasoning on the part of the Commission or to a failure to state reasons vitiating the contested decision, but rather to the fact that that decision applies a different analytical framework from that which favours [Viasat]’.\n\n45\n\n\nAs Viasat has conceded, the contested decision would only be vitiated by a failure to state reasons if the Commission had been required to apply the analytical framework which, according to Viasat, results from Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n46\n\n\nHowever, it follows from paragraph 37 above that Article 106(2) TFEU did not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision. Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in holding that sufficient reasons were stated for the contested decision.\n\n47\n\n\nMoreover, as the Advocate General observed in point 58 of his Opinion, the complaint alleging a failure to respond to the pleas raised in the application at first instance is insufficiently developed for the other parties to the appeal to respond to or for the Court to rule on. Consequently, it is inadmissible.\n\n48\n\n\n Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected as in part inadmissible and in part unfounded.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.\n\nCosts\n\n50\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which apply to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n51\n\n\nSince the Commission and TV2 A/S have applied for costs and Viasat has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay their costs.\n\n52\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure, also applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those Rules, the Member States and institutions which intervene in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.\n\n53\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark, as an intervener before the General Court, is to bear its own costs.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal;\n\n\n2.\n\n\nOrders Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd to pay the costs incurred by the European Commission and TV2/Danmark A/S; \n\n\n3.\n\n\nDeclares that the Kingdom of Denmark is to bear its own costs.\n\n\nSilva de Lapuerta\n\nRegan\n\nBonichot\n\nArabadjiev\n\nFernlund\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 8 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\n after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 10 November 2016, \n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd (‘Viasat’) seeks to have set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 24 September 2015, Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission (T‑125/12, EU:T:2015:687) (‘the judgment under appeal’), by which that court dismissed its action directed against Commission Decision 2011/839/EU of 20 April 2011 on the measures implemented by Denmark (C 2/03) for TV2/Danmark (OJ 2011 L 340, p. 1) (‘the contested decision’), by which the European Commission, while recognising that certain measures adopted by the Kingdom of Denmark in favour of TV2/Danmark (‘TV2’) had the character of State aid, decided that those measures were to be regarded as compatible with the internal market on the basis of Article 106(2) TFEU. \n\n Background to the dispute\n\n2\n\n\nThe General Court set out the background to the dispute in paragraphs 1 to 17 of the judgment under appeal in the following terms:\n\n‘1.\n\n\nThe subject-matter of this action is a claim for annulment, in part, of [the contested decision] in that it finds that [the measures implemented by Denmark for TV2/Danmark], although amounting to State aid, are nevertheless compatible with the internal market, within the meaning of Article 106(2) TFEU. The action has been brought by [Viasat], which is a commercial broadcasting company active on the Danish market and a direct competitor of the Danish broadcasting company TV2/Danmark A/S (“TV2 A/S”).\n\n2.\n\n\nTV2 A/S was created in order to replace, for accounting and tax purposes as of 1 January 2003, the autonomous State undertaking [TV2], established in 1986, by the Lov No 335 om ændring af lov om radio-og fjernsynsvirksomhed ... [(Law No 335 amending the Law on Broadcasting Services) of 4 June 1986]. TV2 A/S is, as was its predecessor TV2, the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio (“DR”).\n\n3.\n\n\nTV2 A/S, like, previously, TV2, has a public-service mission to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes. These may be broadcast by means of radio equipment, in particular, satellite or cable systems. Rules governing the public-service obligations of TV2 A/S and TV2 are laid down by the Danish Minister for Culture.\n\n4.\n\n\nApart from the public broadcasters, commercial television broadcasters operate on the nationwide television broadcasting market in Denmark. These include, first, [Viasat] and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (“SBS”).\n\n5.\n\n\nTV2 was set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of DR, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers. The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike DR, TV2 would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.\n\n6.\n\n\nFollowing a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting AS/TvDanmark, another commercial broadcaster on the Danish market, the system for funding TV2 was examined by the Commission of the European Communities in its Decision 2004/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for [TV2] (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 1; “the TV2 I decision”). That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: licensing fees, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2 (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2 at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees for nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, “the measures concerned”). Lastly, the Commission’s investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2 to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2’s public-service programmes through those installations.\n\n7.\n\n\nAfter examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (now Article 107(1) TFEU). That conclusion was based on the finding that TV2’s funding system, which sought to compensate it for the cost of providing its public services, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [(C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415) (“the Altmark conditions”)].\n\n8.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission decided that the aid granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2, in the form of licence fees and the other measures described in the TV2 I decision, was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (now Article 106(2) TFEU), with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish Kroner (DKK) which it classified as overcompensation (recital 163 to and Article 1 of the TV2 I decision). It accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2 A/S (Article 2 of the TV2 I decision), which had in the meantime replaced TV2 (see paragraph 2 above).\n\n9.\n\n\nGiven that the recovery of aid referred to in Article 2 of the TV2 I decision rendered TV2 A/S insolvent, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission, by letter of 23 July 2004, of a planned recapitalisation of that company. That plan provided, so far as State-funded measures were concerned, for a capital injection of DKK 440 million, on the one hand, and the conversion into capital of a State loan of DKK 394 million, on the other. By its Decision C(2004) 3632 final of 6 October 2004, in State Aid Case No N 313/2004 relating to the recapitalisation of [TV2 A/S] (OJ 2005 C 172, p. 3; “the recapitalisation decision”), the Commission concluded that the two measures planned for TV2 A/S were “necessary to rebuild the capital which TV2 [A/S] need[ed], following its conversion into a limited company, to fulfil its public-service mission” (recital 53 of the recapitalisation decision). Consequently, the Commission decided that any element of State aid that might be connected with the planned recapitalisation of TV2 A/S was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (recital 55 to the recapitalisation decision).\n\n10.\n\n\nThe TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2 A/S (Case T‑309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T‑317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2 A/S, namely [Viasat] (Case T‑329/04) and SBS (Case T‑336/04).\n\n11.\n\n\nBy judgment of 22 October 2008in TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission [(T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457)], the Court annulled the TV2 I decision. [In paragraph 124 of that judgment], the Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that TV2’s public-service mission was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest ... It also found, however, several instances of illegality vitiating the TV2 I decision, which led, in short, to the annulment of that decision.\n\n12.\n\n\nThus, first, examining the question whether the measures concerned by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons for which it took advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, as State resources [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 160 to 167)]. Second, the Court found that the Commission’s examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the legal and economic considerations which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2. The TV2 I decision was, in consequence, vitiated by failure to state reasons on that point [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 224 to 233)]. Third, the Court held that the Commission’s conclusions on the examination of the compatibility of the aid in the light of Article 86(2) EC, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons. According to the Court, that inadequacy of the reasons stated was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the actual legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2 during the period under investigation [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 192, 197 to 203).\n\n13.\n\n\nThe recapitalisation decision was the subject of two actions for annulment, brought by SBS and by [Viasat]. By two orders delivered on 24 September 2009, the Court ruled that, in the light of the annulment of the TV2 I decision and the close link between the obligation to recover the aid resulting from that decision and the measures which are the subject of the recapitalisation decision, it was no longer necessary to rule on those cases [(orders of 24 September 2009, SBS TV and SBS Danish Television v Commission, T‑12/05, not published, EU:T:2009:357, and [of 24 September 2009,] Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, T‑16/05, not published, EU:T:2009:358)].\n\n14.\n\n\nFollowing the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned. On that occasion, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S and, furthermore, received observations from the third parties.\n\n15.\n\n\nThe Commission presented the result of its re-examination of the measures concerned in the contested decision, which is the subject of the present action and of another action brought by TV2 A/S [(TV2/Danmark v Commission, T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684)], in which the Court has delivered its judgment today.\n\n16.\n\n\nThe contested decision concerns the measures granted to TV2 between 1995 and 2002. However, in its analysis the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.\n\n17.\n\n\nIn the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU in favour of TV2 (recital 153 of the contested decision). First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources (recital 90 to the contested decision) and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, it concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions (recital 153 to the contested decision). However, whereas in the TV2 I decision it had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million was overcompensation incompatible with Article 86(2) EC, in the contested decision the Commission took the view that that sum was a capital buffer appropriate for TV2 A/S (recital 233 to the contested decision). In the operative part of the contested decision, it therefore declared as follows:\n\n“Article 1\n\nThe measures implemented by Denmark in favour of [TV2] between 1995 and 2002 in the form of the licence fee resources and other measures discussed in this Decision are compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 106(2) [TFEU].”’ \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n3\n\n\n By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 March 2012, Viasat sought annulment in part of the contested decision.\n\n4\n\n\nViasat claimed that the State aid granted to TV2 was incompatible with the internal market, raising two pleas in this connection. The first plea alleged an error of law committed by the Commission which, in assessing the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU, did not take into account the second and fourth Altmark conditions. The second plea alleged a failure by the Commission to fulfil its duty to state reasons in so far as that institution, without explaining the reasons for its decision, found that Article 106(2) TFEU applied in the present case, although the second and fourth Altmark conditions were not met.\n\n5\n\n\nBy the judgment under appeal, the General Court declared that it was unnecessary to adjudicate on the action, in so far as that action sought the annulment of the contested decision in that the Commission had found that the advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2 by the TV2 Fund amounted to State aid, and dismissed the action as to the remainder .\n\n6\n\n\n By its judgment of 24 September 2015, TV2/Danmark v Commission (T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684), the General Court, in an action brought by TV2, annulled the contested decision in so far as it had characterised as State Aid the advertising revenue received by TV2 for the years 1995 and 1996. \n\nThe forms of order sought\n\n7\n\n\n Viasat claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed its action and annul the contested decision, and order the Commission to pay the costs of the proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice; and\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, set aside judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the General Court for a decision and reserve the decision on costs. \n\n8\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs incurred at both instances. \n\n9\n\n\n The Kingdom of Denmark contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal.\n\n10\n\n\nTV2 A/S contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, dismiss the appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, maintain the effects of the judgment under appeal and of the contested decision; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs of TV2 A/S. \n\nThe request to reopen the oral procedure\n\n11\n\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Advocate General’s Opinion, Viasat, by letter of 3 January 2017, requested the Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure. In support of its request, Viasat submits that the Advocate General’s Opinion distorts some of its arguments and raises separate arguments which were not debated between the parties.\n\n12\n\n\nIt should be borne in mind that, according to Article 83 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that court may, at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n13\n\n\nHowever, the Statute and those Rules make no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk, C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).\n\n14\n\n\nIn that regard, it follows from the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU that it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which require his involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based. Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions examined in that Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraphs 60 and 61 and the case-law cited).\n\n15\n\n\nThe Court therefore considers, having heard the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary information to give judgment and that the information has been the subject of debate between the parties.\n\n16\n\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.\n\nThe appeal\n\nThe first plea, alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n17\n\n\nBy its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measures concerned in the light of the requirements set out in Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular those providing that, first, the application of the rules of the Treaties must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned and, secondly, the performance of those tasks must not affect the development of trade as would be contrary to the interests of the European Union, was not required to take into consideration the fact that those measures did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions. According to those conditions, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation for the performance of the public service is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner, and that compensation must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical and well run undertaking would have incurred in performing the public service tasks concerned.\n\n18\n\n\nViasat claims that it is apparent from the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU that the requirement that the application of the rules in the Treaties, in particular the competition rules, must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned must be interpreted so as to refer to the other provisions of the Treaty. Thus, in an assessment of the compatibility of State aid in the light of Article 106(2) TFEU, those other provisions must be examined beforehand. Therefore, in the present case it should, according to Viasat, have been ascertained in this connection whether or not the application of any of the Altmark conditions obstructed the performance of the public service tasks assigned to TV2. Had that examination taken place, the Commission would have concluded that the adoption, in favour of TV2, of measures meeting the second and fourth Altmark conditions would not have obstructed the performance of that task.\n\n19\n\n\nConsequently, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements that the performance of the tasks at issue must be obstructed and the development of trade cannot be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union, the Commission should have requested the Kingdom of Denmark to prove that complying with the second and fourth Altmark conditions would have prevented the performance of the tasks of general economic interest assigned to TV2. \n\n20\n\n\n The Commission, the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S contend that the first ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n21\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission was not required, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, to take the second and fourth Altmark conditions into consideration in order to ascertain whether compliance with those conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n22\n\n\nIn this connection it must be recalled that, for a national measure to be categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, there must, first, be an intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient and, fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).\n\n23\n\n\nSince those conditions are cumulative, a State measure cannot be characterised as State aid if one of them is not satisfied. By contrast, if all those conditions are met, that measure constitutes State aid and, accordingly, unless it is covered by a derogation provided for by the Treaties, is incompatible with the internal market.\n\n24\n\n\nSo far as concerns the third criterion for characterising a measure as State aid, it is settled case-law that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are regarded as State aid (see judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraph 34).\n\n25\n\n\nHowever, the Court has stated that, where a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations, so that those undertakings do not enjoy a real financial advantage and the measure thus does not have the effect of putting them in a more favourable competitive position than the undertakings competing with them, such a measure is not caught by Article 107(1) TFEU (see judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 87).\n\n26\n\n\nIn accordance with paragraphs 88 to 93 of the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), in order for such a measure not to be characterised as State aid a number of conditions must be met.  First, the recipient undertaking must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined.  Second, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner.  Third, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations.  Fourth, the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations.\n\n27\n\n\nIf the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph were not met, the State measure at issue would be deemed to confer a selective advantage on the recipient undertaking and if, moreover, the other criteria set out in Article 107(1) TFEU were met, that measure would constitute aid in principle incompatible with the internal market.\n\n28\n\n\nArticle 106(2) TFEU provides that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are to be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them and that the development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union.\n\n29\n\n\nAs is provided by case-law, the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU itself shows that exemptions to the Treaty rules are permitted provided that they are necessary for performance of the particular tasks assigned to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 54 and of 28 February 2013, Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas, C‑1/12, EU:C:2013:127, paragraph 106).\n\n30\n\n\nIn that regard, it is clear from the Court’s case-law that it is not necessary that the financial balance or economic viability of the undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest should be threatened.  It is sufficient that, in the absence of the rights at issue, it would not be possible for the undertaking to perform the particular tasks entrusted to it, or that maintenance of those rights is necessary to enable the holder of them to perform tasks of general economic interest which have been assigned to it under economically acceptable conditions (judgment of 15 November 2007, International Mail Spain, C‑162/06, EU:C:2007:681, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).\n\n31\n\n\nIn allowing derogations to be made from the general rules of the Treaty in certain circumstances, Article 106(2) TFEU seeks to reconcile the Member States’ interest in using certain undertakings, in particular in the public sector, as an instrument of economic or fiscal policy with the Union’s interest in ensuring compliance with the rules on competition and the preservation of the unity of the common market (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 55).\n\n32\n\n\nAs set out in paragraph 21 above, Viasat submits that the Commission was required to examine, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, whether meeting the second and the fourth Altmark conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n33\n\n\nIt must be pointed out in this connection that in order to assess a measure under Article 106(2) TFEU, the Commission is not required, contrary to what is claimed by the appellant, to examine whether the conditions laid down by the case-law in Altmark, in particular the second and fourth of those conditions, are met.\n\n34\n\n\nAs the General Court indeed held in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, verification of the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law occurs upstream, that is to say in the examination of the issue of whether the measures at issue must be characterised as State aid.  That issue must be resolved before the one which consists in examining, where necessary, if incompatible aid is nevertheless necessary to the performance of the tasks assigned to the recipient of the measure at issue, under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n35\n\n\nBy contrast, the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law are no longer to be applied where the Commission, having found that a measure must be characterised as aid, in particular in so far as the recipient undertaking is unable to pass the test of comparison with a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public-service requirements, examines whether that aid can be justified under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n36\n\nThat latter provision, which is supplemented by the Protocol (No. 26) on Services of General Interest (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 308) and, as regards the field at issue in the present case, by the Protocol (No. 29) on the System of Public Broadcasting in the Member States (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 312), cannot be interpreted in isolation having regard merely to its wording without also taking into account the additional information in those protocols.\n\n37\n\n\nThe finding in paragraph 35 of the present judgment is supported, as the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, by the wording of Protocol No. 29, which states that ‘the provisions of the Treaties shall be without prejudice to the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting and in so far as such funding is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of the public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and in so far as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Union to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest, while the realisation of the remit of that public service shall be taken into account.’\n\n38\n\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, the General Court therefore did not err in law when it held in the judgment under appeal that Article 106(2) TFEU does not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision.\n\n39\n\n\nThe first ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.\n\nThe second ground of appeal, alleging breach of Article 296 TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n40\n\n\nBy its second ground of appeal, Viasat takes issue with paragraphs 103 and 104 of the judgment under appeal on the ground that the General Court erred in law by rejecting its plea for annulment based on the Commission’s infringement in the contested decision of its obligation to state reasons under Article 296 TFEU.\n\n41\n\n\nViasat also alleges that the General Court failed to reply to the pleas raised in the application at first instance.\n42\n\n\nThe Commission contends that the second ground of appeal is in part inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n43\n\nIt is settled case-law that the statement of reasons required under Article 296 TFEU must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the competent Court of the European Union to exercise its jurisdiction to review legality (judgment of 29 September 2011, Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C‑521/09 P, EU:C:2011:620, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited).\n\n44\n\n\nIt must be observed in this connection that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the plea alleging a failure to state reasons in the contested decision by stating that ‘the fact that the contested decision does not mention the role of the second and fourth Altmark conditions in the assessment of the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market is not attributable to an error of reasoning on the part of the Commission or to a failure to state reasons vitiating the contested decision, but rather to the fact that that decision applies a different analytical framework from that which favours [Viasat]’.\n\n45\n\n\nAs Viasat has conceded, the contested decision would only be vitiated by a failure to state reasons if the Commission had been required to apply the analytical framework which, according to Viasat, results from Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n46\n\n\nHowever, it follows from paragraph 37 above that Article 106(2) TFEU did not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision. Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in holding that sufficient reasons were stated for the contested decision.\n\n47\n\n\nMoreover, as the Advocate General observed in point 58 of his Opinion, the complaint alleging a failure to respond to the pleas raised in the application at first instance is insufficiently developed for the other parties to the appeal to respond to or for the Court to rule on. Consequently, it is inadmissible.\n\n48\n\n\n Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected as in part inadmissible and in part unfounded.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.\n\nCosts\n\n50\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which apply to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n51\n\n\nSince the Commission and TV2 A/S have applied for costs and Viasat has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay their costs.\n\n52\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure, also applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those Rules, the Member States and institutions which intervene in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.\n\n53\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark, as an intervener before the General Court, is to bear its own costs.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal;\n\n\n2.\n\n\nOrders Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd to pay the costs incurred by the European Commission and TV2/Danmark A/S; \n\n\n3.\n\n\nDeclares that the Kingdom of Denmark is to bear its own costs.\n\n\nSilva de Lapuerta\n\nRegan\n\nBonichot\n\nArabadjiev\n\nFernlund\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 8 March 2017.\n\nA.

The action has been brought by [Viasat], which is a commercial broadcasting company active on the Danish market and a direct competitor of the Danish broadcasting company TV2/Danmark A/S (“TV2 A/S”).\n\n2.\n\n\nTV2 A/S was created in order to replace, for accounting and tax purposes as of 1 January 2003, the autonomous State undertaking [TV2], established in 1986, by the Lov No 335 om ændring af lov om radio-og fjernsynsvirksomhed ... [(Law No 335 amending the Law on Broadcasting Services) of 4 June 1986]. TV2 A/S is, as was its predecessor TV2, the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio (“DR”).\n\n3.\n\n\nTV2 A/S, like, previously, TV2, has a public-service mission to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes. These may be broadcast by means of radio equipment, in particular, satellite or cable systems. Rules governing the public-service obligations of TV2 A/S and TV2 are laid down by the Danish Minister for Culture.\n\n4.\n\n\nApart from the public broadcasters, commercial television broadcasters operate on the nationwide television broadcasting market in Denmark. These include, first, [Viasat] and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (“SBS”).\n\n5.\n\n\nTV2 was set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of DR, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers. The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike DR, TV2 would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.\n\n6.\n\n\nFollowing a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting AS/TvDanmark, another commercial broadcaster on the Danish market, the system for funding TV2 was examined by the Commission of the European Communities in its Decision 2004/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for [TV2] (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 1; “the TV2 I decision”). That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: licensing fees, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2 (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2 at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees for nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, “the measures concerned”). Lastly, the Commission’s investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2 to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2’s public-service programmes through those installations.\n\n7.\n\n\nAfter examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (now Article 107(1) TFEU). That conclusion was based on the finding that TV2’s funding system, which sought to compensate it for the cost of providing its public services, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [(C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415) (“the Altmark conditions”)].\n\n8.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission decided that the aid granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2, in the form of licence fees and the other measures described in the TV2 I decision, was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (now Article 106(2) TFEU), with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish Kroner (DKK) which it classified as overcompensation (recital 163 to and Article 1 of the TV2 I decision). It accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2 A/S (Article 2 of the TV2 I decision), which had in the meantime replaced TV2 (see paragraph 2 above).\n\n9.\n\n\nGiven that the recovery of aid referred to in Article 2 of the TV2 I decision rendered TV2 A/S insolvent, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission, by letter of 23 July 2004, of a planned recapitalisation of that company. That plan provided, so far as State-funded measures were concerned, for a capital injection of DKK 440 million, on the one hand, and the conversion into capital of a State loan of DKK 394 million, on the other. By its Decision C(2004) 3632 final of 6 October 2004, in State Aid Case No N 313/2004 relating to the recapitalisation of [TV2 A/S] (OJ 2005 C 172, p. 3; “the recapitalisation decision”), the Commission concluded that the two measures planned for TV2 A/S were “necessary to rebuild the capital which TV2 [A/S] need[ed], following its conversion into a limited company, to fulfil its public-service mission” (recital 53 of the recapitalisation decision). Consequently, the Commission decided that any element of State aid that might be connected with the planned recapitalisation of TV2 A/S was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (recital 55 to the recapitalisation decision).\n\n10.\n\n\nThe TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2 A/S (Case T‑309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T‑317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2 A/S, namely [Viasat] (Case T‑329/04) and SBS (Case T‑336/04).\n\n11.\n\n\nBy judgment of 22 October 2008in TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission [(T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457)], the Court annulled the TV2 I decision. [In paragraph 124 of that judgment], the Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that TV2’s public-service mission was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest ... It also found, however, several instances of illegality vitiating the TV2 I decision, which led, in short, to the annulment of that decision.\n\n12.\n\n\nThus, first, examining the question whether the measures concerned by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons for which it took advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, as State resources [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 160 to 167)]. Second, the Court found that the Commission’s examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the legal and economic considerations which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2. The TV2 I decision was, in consequence, vitiated by failure to state reasons on that point [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 224 to 233)]. Third, the Court held that the Commission’s conclusions on the examination of the compatibility of the aid in the light of Article 86(2) EC, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons. According to the Court, that inadequacy of the reasons stated was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the actual legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2 during the period under investigation [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 192, 197 to 203).\n\n13.\n\n\nThe recapitalisation decision was the subject of two actions for annulment, brought by SBS and by [Viasat]. By two orders delivered on 24 September 2009, the Court ruled that, in the light of the annulment of the TV2 I decision and the close link between the obligation to recover the aid resulting from that decision and the measures which are the subject of the recapitalisation decision, it was no longer necessary to rule on those cases [(orders of 24 September 2009, SBS TV and SBS Danish Television v Commission, T‑12/05, not published, EU:T:2009:357, and [of 24 September 2009,] Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, T‑16/05, not published, EU:T:2009:358)].\n\n14.\n\n\nFollowing the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned. On that occasion, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S and, furthermore, received observations from the third parties.\n\n15.\n\n\nThe Commission presented the result of its re-examination of the measures concerned in the contested decision, which is the subject of the present action and of another action brought by TV2 A/S [(TV2/Danmark v Commission, T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684)], in which the Court has delivered its judgment today.\n\n16.\n\n\nThe contested decision concerns the measures granted to TV2 between 1995 and 2002. However, in its analysis the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.\n\n17.\n\n\nIn the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU in favour of TV2 (recital 153 of the contested decision). First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources (recital 90 to the contested decision) and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, it concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions (recital 153 to the contested decision). However, whereas in the TV2 I decision it had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million was overcompensation incompatible with Article 86(2) EC, in the contested decision the Commission took the view that that sum was a capital buffer appropriate for TV2 A/S (recital 233 to the contested decision). In the operative part of the contested decision, it therefore declared as follows:\n\n“Article 1\n\nThe measures implemented by Denmark in favour of [TV2] between 1995 and 2002 in the form of the licence fee resources and other measures discussed in this Decision are compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 106(2) [TFEU].”’ \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n3\n\n\n By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 March 2012, Viasat sought annulment in part of the contested decision.\n\n4\n\n\nViasat claimed that the State aid granted to TV2 was incompatible with the internal market, raising two pleas in this connection. The first plea alleged an error of law committed by the Commission which, in assessing the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU, did not take into account the second and fourth Altmark conditions. The second plea alleged a failure by the Commission to fulfil its duty to state reasons in so far as that institution, without explaining the reasons for its decision, found that Article 106(2) TFEU applied in the present case, although the second and fourth Altmark conditions were not met.\n\n5\n\n\nBy the judgment under appeal, the General Court declared that it was unnecessary to adjudicate on the action, in so far as that action sought the annulment of the contested decision in that the Commission had found that the advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2 by the TV2 Fund amounted to State aid, and dismissed the action as to the remainder .\n\n6\n\n\n By its judgment of 24 September 2015, TV2/Danmark v Commission (T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684), the General Court, in an action brought by TV2, annulled the contested decision in so far as it had characterised as State Aid the advertising revenue received by TV2 for the years 1995 and 1996. \n\nThe forms of order sought\n\n7\n\n\n Viasat claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed its action and annul the contested decision, and order the Commission to pay the costs of the proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice; and\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, set aside judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the General Court for a decision and reserve the decision on costs. \n\n8\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs incurred at both instances. \n\n9\n\n\n The Kingdom of Denmark contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal.\n\n10\n\n\nTV2 A/S contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, dismiss the appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, maintain the effects of the judgment under appeal and of the contested decision; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs of TV2 A/S. \n\nThe request to reopen the oral procedure\n\n11\n\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Advocate General’s Opinion, Viasat, by letter of 3 January 2017, requested the Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure. In support of its request, Viasat submits that the Advocate General’s Opinion distorts some of its arguments and raises separate arguments which were not debated between the parties.\n\n12\n\n\nIt should be borne in mind that, according to Article 83 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that court may, at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n13\n\n\nHowever, the Statute and those Rules make no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk, C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).\n\n14\n\n\nIn that regard, it follows from the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU that it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which require his involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based. Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions examined in that Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraphs 60 and 61 and the case-law cited).\n\n15\n\n\nThe Court therefore considers, having heard the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary information to give judgment and that the information has been the subject of debate between the parties.\n\n16\n\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.\n\nThe appeal\n\nThe first plea, alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n17\n\n\nBy its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measures concerned in the light of the requirements set out in Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular those providing that, first, the application of the rules of the Treaties must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned and, secondly, the performance of those tasks must not affect the development of trade as would be contrary to the interests of the European Union, was not required to take into consideration the fact that those measures did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions. According to those conditions, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation for the performance of the public service is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner, and that compensation must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical and well run undertaking would have incurred in performing the public service tasks concerned.\n\n18\n\n\nViasat claims that it is apparent from the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU that the requirement that the application of the rules in the Treaties, in particular the competition rules, must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned must be interpreted so as to refer to the other provisions of the Treaty. Thus, in an assessment of the compatibility of State aid in the light of Article 106(2) TFEU, those other provisions must be examined beforehand. Therefore, in the present case it should, according to Viasat, have been ascertained in this connection whether or not the application of any of the Altmark conditions obstructed the performance of the public service tasks assigned to TV2. Had that examination taken place, the Commission would have concluded that the adoption, in favour of TV2, of measures meeting the second and fourth Altmark conditions would not have obstructed the performance of that task.\n\n19\n\n\nConsequently, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements that the performance of the tasks at issue must be obstructed and the development of trade cannot be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union, the Commission should have requested the Kingdom of Denmark to prove that complying with the second and fourth Altmark conditions would have prevented the performance of the tasks of general economic interest assigned to TV2. \n\n20\n\n\n The Commission, the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S contend that the first ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n21\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission was not required, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, to take the second and fourth Altmark conditions into consideration in order to ascertain whether compliance with those conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n22\n\n\nIn this connection it must be recalled that, for a national measure to be categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, there must, first, be an intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient and, fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).\n\n23\n\n\nSince those conditions are cumulative, a State measure cannot be characterised as State aid if one of them is not satisfied. By contrast, if all those conditions are met, that measure constitutes State aid and, accordingly, unless it is covered by a derogation provided for by the Treaties, is incompatible with the internal market.\n\n24\n\n\nSo far as concerns the third criterion for characterising a measure as State aid, it is settled case-law that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are regarded as State aid (see judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraph 34).\n\n25\n\n\nHowever, the Court has stated that, where a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations, so that those undertakings do not enjoy a real financial advantage and the measure thus does not have the effect of putting them in a more favourable competitive position than the undertakings competing with them, such a measure is not caught by Article 107(1) TFEU (see judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 87).\n\n26\n\n\nIn accordance with paragraphs 88 to 93 of the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), in order for such a measure not to be characterised as State aid a number of conditions must be met.  First, the recipient undertaking must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined.  Second, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner.  Third, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations.  Fourth, the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations.\n\n27\n\n\nIf the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph were not met, the State measure at issue would be deemed to confer a selective advantage on the recipient undertaking and if, moreover, the other criteria set out in Article 107(1) TFEU were met, that measure would constitute aid in principle incompatible with the internal market.\n\n28\n\n\nArticle 106(2) TFEU provides that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are to be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them and that the development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union.\n\n29\n\n\nAs is provided by case-law, the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU itself shows that exemptions to the Treaty rules are permitted provided that they are necessary for performance of the particular tasks assigned to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 54 and of 28 February 2013, Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas, C‑1/12, EU:C:2013:127, paragraph 106).\n\n30\n\n\nIn that regard, it is clear from the Court’s case-law that it is not necessary that the financial balance or economic viability of the undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest should be threatened.  It is sufficient that, in the absence of the rights at issue, it would not be possible for the undertaking to perform the particular tasks entrusted to it, or that maintenance of those rights is necessary to enable the holder of them to perform tasks of general economic interest which have been assigned to it under economically acceptable conditions (judgment of 15 November 2007, International Mail Spain, C‑162/06, EU:C:2007:681, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).\n\n31\n\n\nIn allowing derogations to be made from the general rules of the Treaty in certain circumstances, Article 106(2) TFEU seeks to reconcile the Member States’ interest in using certain undertakings, in particular in the public sector, as an instrument of economic or fiscal policy with the Union’s interest in ensuring compliance with the rules on competition and the preservation of the unity of the common market (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 55).\n\n32\n\n\nAs set out in paragraph 21 above, Viasat submits that the Commission was required to examine, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, whether meeting the second and the fourth Altmark conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n33\n\n\nIt must be pointed out in this connection that in order to assess a measure under Article 106(2) TFEU, the Commission is not required, contrary to what is claimed by the appellant, to examine whether the conditions laid down by the case-law in Altmark, in particular the second and fourth of those conditions, are met.\n\n34\n\n\nAs the General Court indeed held in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, verification of the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law occurs upstream, that is to say in the examination of the issue of whether the measures at issue must be characterised as State aid.  That issue must be resolved before the one which consists in examining, where necessary, if incompatible aid is nevertheless necessary to the performance of the tasks assigned to the recipient of the measure at issue, under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n35\n\n\nBy contrast, the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law are no longer to be applied where the Commission, having found that a measure must be characterised as aid, in particular in so far as the recipient undertaking is unable to pass the test of comparison with a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public-service requirements, examines whether that aid can be justified under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n36\n\nThat latter provision, which is supplemented by the Protocol (No. 26) on Services of General Interest (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 308) and, as regards the field at issue in the present case, by the Protocol (No. 29) on the System of Public Broadcasting in the Member States (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 312), cannot be interpreted in isolation having regard merely to its wording without also taking into account the additional information in those protocols.\n\n37\n\n\nThe finding in paragraph 35 of the present judgment is supported, as the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, by the wording of Protocol No. 29, which states that ‘the provisions of the Treaties shall be without prejudice to the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting and in so far as such funding is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of the public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and in so far as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Union to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest, while the realisation of the remit of that public service shall be taken into account.’\n\n38\n\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, the General Court therefore did not err in law when it held in the judgment under appeal that Article 106(2) TFEU does not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision.\n\n39\n\n\nThe first ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.\n\nThe second ground of appeal, alleging breach of Article 296 TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n40\n\n\nBy its second ground of appeal, Viasat takes issue with paragraphs 103 and 104 of the judgment under appeal on the ground that the General Court erred in law by rejecting its plea for annulment based on the Commission’s infringement in the contested decision of its obligation to state reasons under Article 296 TFEU.\n\n41\n\n\nViasat also alleges that the General Court failed to reply to the pleas raised in the application at first instance.\n42\n\n\nThe Commission contends that the second ground of appeal is in part inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n43\n\nIt is settled case-law that the statement of reasons required under Article 296 TFEU must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the competent Court of the European Union to exercise its jurisdiction to review legality (judgment of 29 September 2011, Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C‑521/09 P, EU:C:2011:620, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited).\n\n44\n\n\nIt must be observed in this connection that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the plea alleging a failure to state reasons in the contested decision by stating that ‘the fact that the contested decision does not mention the role of the second and fourth Altmark conditions in the assessment of the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market is not attributable to an error of reasoning on the part of the Commission or to a failure to state reasons vitiating the contested decision, but rather to the fact that that decision applies a different analytical framework from that which favours [Viasat]’.\n\n45\n\n\nAs Viasat has conceded, the contested decision would only be vitiated by a failure to state reasons if the Commission had been required to apply the analytical framework which, according to Viasat, results from Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n46\n\n\nHowever, it follows from paragraph 37 above that Article 106(2) TFEU did not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision. Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in holding that sufficient reasons were stated for the contested decision.\n\n47\n\n\nMoreover, as the Advocate General observed in point 58 of his Opinion, the complaint alleging a failure to respond to the pleas raised in the application at first instance is insufficiently developed for the other parties to the appeal to respond to or for the Court to rule on. Consequently, it is inadmissible.\n\n48\n\n\n Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected as in part inadmissible and in part unfounded.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.\n\nCosts\n\n50\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which apply to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n51\n\n\nSince the Commission and TV2 A/S have applied for costs and Viasat has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay their costs.\n\n52\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure, also applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those Rules, the Member States and institutions which intervene in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.\n\n53\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark, as an intervener before the General Court, is to bear its own costs.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal;\n\n\n2.\n\n\nOrders Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd to pay the costs incurred by the European Commission and TV2/Danmark A/S; \n\n\n3.\n\n\nDeclares that the Kingdom of Denmark is to bear its own costs.\n\n\nSilva de Lapuerta\n\nRegan\n\nBonichot\n\nArabadjiev\n\nFernlund\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 8 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\n after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 10 November 2016, \n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd (‘Viasat’) seeks to have set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 24 September 2015, Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission (T‑125/12, EU:T:2015:687) (‘the judgment under appeal’), by which that court dismissed its action directed against Commission Decision 2011/839/EU of 20 April 2011 on the measures implemented by Denmark (C 2/03) for TV2/Danmark (OJ 2011 L 340, p. 1) (‘the contested decision’), by which the European Commission, while recognising that certain measures adopted by the Kingdom of Denmark in favour of TV2/Danmark (‘TV2’) had the character of State aid, decided that those measures were to be regarded as compatible with the internal market on the basis of Article 106(2) TFEU. \n\n Background to the dispute\n\n2\n\n\nThe General Court set out the background to the dispute in paragraphs 1 to 17 of the judgment under appeal in the following terms:\n\n‘1.\n\n\nThe subject-matter of this action is a claim for annulment, in part, of [the contested decision] in that it finds that [the measures implemented by Denmark for TV2/Danmark], although amounting to State aid, are nevertheless compatible with the internal market, within the meaning of Article 106(2) TFEU. The action has been brought by [Viasat], which is a commercial broadcasting company active on the Danish market and a direct competitor of the Danish broadcasting company TV2/Danmark A/S (“TV2 A/S”).\n\n2.\n\n\nTV2 A/S was created in order to replace, for accounting and tax purposes as of 1 January 2003, the autonomous State undertaking [TV2], established in 1986, by the Lov No 335 om ændring af lov om radio-og fjernsynsvirksomhed ... [(Law No 335 amending the Law on Broadcasting Services) of 4 June 1986]. TV2 A/S is, as was its predecessor TV2, the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio (“DR”).\n\n3.\n\n\nTV2 A/S, like, previously, TV2, has a public-service mission to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes. These may be broadcast by means of radio equipment, in particular, satellite or cable systems. Rules governing the public-service obligations of TV2 A/S and TV2 are laid down by the Danish Minister for Culture.\n\n4.\n\n\nApart from the public broadcasters, commercial television broadcasters operate on the nationwide television broadcasting market in Denmark. These include, first, [Viasat] and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (“SBS”).\n\n5.\n\n\nTV2 was set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of DR, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers. The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike DR, TV2 would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.\n\n6.\n\n\nFollowing a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting AS/TvDanmark, another commercial broadcaster on the Danish market, the system for funding TV2 was examined by the Commission of the European Communities in its Decision 2004/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for [TV2] (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 1; “the TV2 I decision”). That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: licensing fees, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2 (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2 at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees for nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, “the measures concerned”). Lastly, the Commission’s investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2 to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2’s public-service programmes through those installations.\n\n7.\n\n\nAfter examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (now Article 107(1) TFEU). That conclusion was based on the finding that TV2’s funding system, which sought to compensate it for the cost of providing its public services, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [(C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415) (“the Altmark conditions”)].\n\n8.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission decided that the aid granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2, in the form of licence fees and the other measures described in the TV2 I decision, was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (now Article 106(2) TFEU), with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish Kroner (DKK) which it classified as overcompensation (recital 163 to and Article 1 of the TV2 I decision). It accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2 A/S (Article 2 of the TV2 I decision), which had in the meantime replaced TV2 (see paragraph 2 above).\n\n9.\n\n\nGiven that the recovery of aid referred to in Article 2 of the TV2 I decision rendered TV2 A/S insolvent, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission, by letter of 23 July 2004, of a planned recapitalisation of that company. That plan provided, so far as State-funded measures were concerned, for a capital injection of DKK 440 million, on the one hand, and the conversion into capital of a State loan of DKK 394 million, on the other. By its Decision C(2004) 3632 final of 6 October 2004, in State Aid Case No N 313/2004 relating to the recapitalisation of [TV2 A/S] (OJ 2005 C 172, p. 3; “the recapitalisation decision”), the Commission concluded that the two measures planned for TV2 A/S were “necessary to rebuild the capital which TV2 [A/S] need[ed], following its conversion into a limited company, to fulfil its public-service mission” (recital 53 of the recapitalisation decision). Consequently, the Commission decided that any element of State aid that might be connected with the planned recapitalisation of TV2 A/S was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (recital 55 to the recapitalisation decision).\n\n10.\n\n\nThe TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2 A/S (Case T‑309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T‑317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2 A/S, namely [Viasat] (Case T‑329/04) and SBS (Case T‑336/04).\n\n11.\n\n\nBy judgment of 22 October 2008in TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission [(T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457)], the Court annulled the TV2 I decision. [In paragraph 124 of that judgment], the Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that TV2’s public-service mission was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest ... It also found, however, several instances of illegality vitiating the TV2 I decision, which led, in short, to the annulment of that decision.\n\n12.\n\n\nThus, first, examining the question whether the measures concerned by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons for which it took advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, as State resources [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 160 to 167)]. Second, the Court found that the Commission’s examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the legal and economic considerations which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2. The TV2 I decision was, in consequence, vitiated by failure to state reasons on that point [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 224 to 233)]. Third, the Court held that the Commission’s conclusions on the examination of the compatibility of the aid in the light of Article 86(2) EC, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons. According to the Court, that inadequacy of the reasons stated was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the actual legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2 during the period under investigation [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 192, 197 to 203).\n\n13.\n\n\nThe recapitalisation decision was the subject of two actions for annulment, brought by SBS and by [Viasat]. By two orders delivered on 24 September 2009, the Court ruled that, in the light of the annulment of the TV2 I decision and the close link between the obligation to recover the aid resulting from that decision and the measures which are the subject of the recapitalisation decision, it was no longer necessary to rule on those cases [(orders of 24 September 2009, SBS TV and SBS Danish Television v Commission, T‑12/05, not published, EU:T:2009:357, and [of 24 September 2009,] Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, T‑16/05, not published, EU:T:2009:358)].\n\n14.\n\n\nFollowing the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned. On that occasion, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S and, furthermore, received observations from the third parties.\n\n15.\n\n\nThe Commission presented the result of its re-examination of the measures concerned in the contested decision, which is the subject of the present action and of another action brought by TV2 A/S [(TV2/Danmark v Commission, T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684)], in which the Court has delivered its judgment today.\n\n16.\n\n\nThe contested decision concerns the measures granted to TV2 between 1995 and 2002. However, in its analysis the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.\n\n17.\n\n\nIn the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU in favour of TV2 (recital 153 of the contested decision). First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources (recital 90 to the contested decision) and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, it concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions (recital 153 to the contested decision). However, whereas in the TV2 I decision it had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million was overcompensation incompatible with Article 86(2) EC, in the contested decision the Commission took the view that that sum was a capital buffer appropriate for TV2 A/S (recital 233 to the contested decision). In the operative part of the contested decision, it therefore declared as follows:\n\n“Article 1\n\nThe measures implemented by Denmark in favour of [TV2] between 1995 and 2002 in the form of the licence fee resources and other measures discussed in this Decision are compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 106(2) [TFEU].”’ \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n3\n\n\n By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 March 2012, Viasat sought annulment in part of the contested decision.\n\n4\n\n\nViasat claimed that the State aid granted to TV2 was incompatible with the internal market, raising two pleas in this connection. The first plea alleged an error of law committed by the Commission which, in assessing the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU, did not take into account the second and fourth Altmark conditions. The second plea alleged a failure by the Commission to fulfil its duty to state reasons in so far as that institution, without explaining the reasons for its decision, found that Article 106(2) TFEU applied in the present case, although the second and fourth Altmark conditions were not met.\n\n5\n\n\nBy the judgment under appeal, the General Court declared that it was unnecessary to adjudicate on the action, in so far as that action sought the annulment of the contested decision in that the Commission had found that the advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2 by the TV2 Fund amounted to State aid, and dismissed the action as to the remainder .\n\n6\n\n\n By its judgment of 24 September 2015, TV2/Danmark v Commission (T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684), the General Court, in an action brought by TV2, annulled the contested decision in so far as it had characterised as State Aid the advertising revenue received by TV2 for the years 1995 and 1996. \n\nThe forms of order sought\n\n7\n\n\n Viasat claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed its action and annul the contested decision, and order the Commission to pay the costs of the proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice; and\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, set aside judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the General Court for a decision and reserve the decision on costs. \n\n8\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs incurred at both instances. \n\n9\n\n\n The Kingdom of Denmark contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal.\n\n10\n\n\nTV2 A/S contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, dismiss the appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, maintain the effects of the judgment under appeal and of the contested decision; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs of TV2 A/S. \n\nThe request to reopen the oral procedure\n\n11\n\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Advocate General’s Opinion, Viasat, by letter of 3 January 2017, requested the Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure. In support of its request, Viasat submits that the Advocate General’s Opinion distorts some of its arguments and raises separate arguments which were not debated between the parties.\n\n12\n\n\nIt should be borne in mind that, according to Article 83 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that court may, at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n13\n\n\nHowever, the Statute and those Rules make no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk, C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).\n\n14\n\n\nIn that regard, it follows from the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU that it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which require his involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based. Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions examined in that Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraphs 60 and 61 and the case-law cited).\n\n15\n\n\nThe Court therefore considers, having heard the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary information to give judgment and that the information has been the subject of debate between the parties.\n\n16\n\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.\n\nThe appeal\n\nThe first plea, alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n17\n\n\nBy its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measures concerned in the light of the requirements set out in Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular those providing that, first, the application of the rules of the Treaties must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned and, secondly, the performance of those tasks must not affect the development of trade as would be contrary to the interests of the European Union, was not required to take into consideration the fact that those measures did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions. According to those conditions, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation for the performance of the public service is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner, and that compensation must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical and well run undertaking would have incurred in performing the public service tasks concerned.\n\n18\n\n\nViasat claims that it is apparent from the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU that the requirement that the application of the rules in the Treaties, in particular the competition rules, must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned must be interpreted so as to refer to the other provisions of the Treaty. Thus, in an assessment of the compatibility of State aid in the light of Article 106(2) TFEU, those other provisions must be examined beforehand. Therefore, in the present case it should, according to Viasat, have been ascertained in this connection whether or not the application of any of the Altmark conditions obstructed the performance of the public service tasks assigned to TV2. Had that examination taken place, the Commission would have concluded that the adoption, in favour of TV2, of measures meeting the second and fourth Altmark conditions would not have obstructed the performance of that task.\n\n19\n\n\nConsequently, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements that the performance of the tasks at issue must be obstructed and the development of trade cannot be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union, the Commission should have requested the Kingdom of Denmark to prove that complying with the second and fourth Altmark conditions would have prevented the performance of the tasks of general economic interest assigned to TV2. \n\n20\n\n\n The Commission, the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S contend that the first ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n21\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission was not required, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, to take the second and fourth Altmark conditions into consideration in order to ascertain whether compliance with those conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n22\n\n\nIn this connection it must be recalled that, for a national measure to be categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, there must, first, be an intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient and, fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).\n\n23\n\n\nSince those conditions are cumulative, a State measure cannot be characterised as State aid if one of them is not satisfied. By contrast, if all those conditions are met, that measure constitutes State aid and, accordingly, unless it is covered by a derogation provided for by the Treaties, is incompatible with the internal market.\n\n24\n\n\nSo far as concerns the third criterion for characterising a measure as State aid, it is settled case-law that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are regarded as State aid (see judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraph 34).\n\n25\n\n\nHowever, the Court has stated that, where a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations, so that those undertakings do not enjoy a real financial advantage and the measure thus does not have the effect of putting them in a more favourable competitive position than the undertakings competing with them, such a measure is not caught by Article 107(1) TFEU (see judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 87).\n\n26\n\n\nIn accordance with paragraphs 88 to 93 of the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), in order for such a measure not to be characterised as State aid a number of conditions must be met.  First, the recipient undertaking must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined.  Second, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner.  Third, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations.  Fourth, the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations.\n\n27\n\n\nIf the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph were not met, the State measure at issue would be deemed to confer a selective advantage on the recipient undertaking and if, moreover, the other criteria set out in Article 107(1) TFEU were met, that measure would constitute aid in principle incompatible with the internal market.\n\n28\n\n\nArticle 106(2) TFEU provides that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are to be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them and that the development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union.\n\n29\n\n\nAs is provided by case-law, the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU itself shows that exemptions to the Treaty rules are permitted provided that they are necessary for performance of the particular tasks assigned to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 54 and of 28 February 2013, Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas, C‑1/12, EU:C:2013:127, paragraph 106).\n\n30\n\n\nIn that regard, it is clear from the Court’s case-law that it is not necessary that the financial balance or economic viability of the undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest should be threatened.  It is sufficient that, in the absence of the rights at issue, it would not be possible for the undertaking to perform the particular tasks entrusted to it, or that maintenance of those rights is necessary to enable the holder of them to perform tasks of general economic interest which have been assigned to it under economically acceptable conditions (judgment of 15 November 2007, International Mail Spain, C‑162/06, EU:C:2007:681, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).\n\n31\n\n\nIn allowing derogations to be made from the general rules of the Treaty in certain circumstances, Article 106(2) TFEU seeks to reconcile the Member States’ interest in using certain undertakings, in particular in the public sector, as an instrument of economic or fiscal policy with the Union’s interest in ensuring compliance with the rules on competition and the preservation of the unity of the common market (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 55).\n\n32\n\n\nAs set out in paragraph 21 above, Viasat submits that the Commission was required to examine, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, whether meeting the second and the fourth Altmark conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n33\n\n\nIt must be pointed out in this connection that in order to assess a measure under Article 106(2) TFEU, the Commission is not required, contrary to what is claimed by the appellant, to examine whether the conditions laid down by the case-law in Altmark, in particular the second and fourth of those conditions, are met.\n\n34\n\n\nAs the General Court indeed held in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, verification of the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law occurs upstream, that is to say in the examination of the issue of whether the measures at issue must be characterised as State aid.  That issue must be resolved before the one which consists in examining, where necessary, if incompatible aid is nevertheless necessary to the performance of the tasks assigned to the recipient of the measure at issue, under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n35\n\n\nBy contrast, the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law are no longer to be applied where the Commission, having found that a measure must be characterised as aid, in particular in so far as the recipient undertaking is unable to pass the test of comparison with a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public-service requirements, examines whether that aid can be justified under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n36\n\nThat latter provision, which is supplemented by the Protocol (No. 26) on Services of General Interest (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 308) and, as regards the field at issue in the present case, by the Protocol (No. 29) on the System of Public Broadcasting in the Member States (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 312), cannot be interpreted in isolation having regard merely to its wording without also taking into account the additional information in those protocols.\n\n37\n\n\nThe finding in paragraph 35 of the present judgment is supported, as the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, by the wording of Protocol No. 29, which states that ‘the provisions of the Treaties shall be without prejudice to the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting and in so far as such funding is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of the public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and in so far as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Union to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest, while the realisation of the remit of that public service shall be taken into account.’\n\n38\n\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, the General Court therefore did not err in law when it held in the judgment under appeal that Article 106(2) TFEU does not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision.\n\n39\n\n\nThe first ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.\n\nThe second ground of appeal, alleging breach of Article 296 TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n40\n\n\nBy its second ground of appeal, Viasat takes issue with paragraphs 103 and 104 of the judgment under appeal on the ground that the General Court erred in law by rejecting its plea for annulment based on the Commission’s infringement in the contested decision of its obligation to state reasons under Article 296 TFEU.\n\n41\n\n\nViasat also alleges that the General Court failed to reply to the pleas raised in the application at first instance.\n42\n\n\nThe Commission contends that the second ground of appeal is in part inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n43\n\nIt is settled case-law that the statement of reasons required under Article 296 TFEU must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the competent Court of the European Union to exercise its jurisdiction to review legality (judgment of 29 September 2011, Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C‑521/09 P, EU:C:2011:620, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited).\n\n44\n\n\nIt must be observed in this connection that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the plea alleging a failure to state reasons in the contested decision by stating that ‘the fact that the contested decision does not mention the role of the second and fourth Altmark conditions in the assessment of the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market is not attributable to an error of reasoning on the part of the Commission or to a failure to state reasons vitiating the contested decision, but rather to the fact that that decision applies a different analytical framework from that which favours [Viasat]’.\n\n45\n\n\nAs Viasat has conceded, the contested decision would only be vitiated by a failure to state reasons if the Commission had been required to apply the analytical framework which, according to Viasat, results from Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n46\n\n\nHowever, it follows from paragraph 37 above that Article 106(2) TFEU did not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision. Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in holding that sufficient reasons were stated for the contested decision.\n\n47\n\n\nMoreover, as the Advocate General observed in point 58 of his Opinion, the complaint alleging a failure to respond to the pleas raised in the application at first instance is insufficiently developed for the other parties to the appeal to respond to or for the Court to rule on. Consequently, it is inadmissible.\n\n48\n\n\n Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected as in part inadmissible and in part unfounded.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.\n\nCosts\n\n50\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which apply to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n51\n\n\nSince the Commission and TV2 A/S have applied for costs and Viasat has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay their costs.\n\n52\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure, also applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those Rules, the Member States and institutions which intervene in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.\n\n53\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark, as an intervener before the General Court, is to bear its own costs.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal;\n\n\n2.\n\n\nOrders Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd to pay the costs incurred by the European Commission and TV2/Danmark A/S; \n\n\n3.\n\n\nDeclares that the Kingdom of Denmark is to bear its own costs.\n\n\nSilva de Lapuerta\n\nRegan\n\nBonichot\n\nArabadjiev\n\nFernlund\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 8 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\n after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 10 November 2016, \n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd (‘Viasat’) seeks to have set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 24 September 2015, Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission (T‑125/12, EU:T:2015:687) (‘the judgment under appeal’), by which that court dismissed its action directed against Commission Decision 2011/839/EU of 20 April 2011 on the measures implemented by Denmark (C 2/03) for TV2/Danmark (OJ 2011 L 340, p. 1) (‘the contested decision’), by which the European Commission, while recognising that certain measures adopted by the Kingdom of Denmark in favour of TV2/Danmark (‘TV2’) had the character of State aid, decided that those measures were to be regarded as compatible with the internal market on the basis of Article 106(2) TFEU. \n\n Background to the dispute\n\n2\n\n\nThe General Court set out the background to the dispute in paragraphs 1 to 17 of the judgment under appeal in the following terms:\n\n‘1.\n\n\nThe subject-matter of this action is a claim for annulment, in part, of [the contested decision] in that it finds that [the measures implemented by Denmark for TV2/Danmark], although amounting to State aid, are nevertheless compatible with the internal market, within the meaning of Article 106(2) TFEU. The action has been brought by [Viasat], which is a commercial broadcasting company active on the Danish market and a direct competitor of the Danish broadcasting company TV2/Danmark A/S (“TV2 A/S”).\n\n2.\n\n\nTV2 A/S was created in order to replace, for accounting and tax purposes as of 1 January 2003, the autonomous State undertaking [TV2], established in 1986, by the Lov No 335 om ændring af lov om radio-og fjernsynsvirksomhed ... [(Law No 335 amending the Law on Broadcasting Services) of 4 June 1986]. TV2 A/S is, as was its predecessor TV2, the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio (“DR”).\n\n3.\n\n\nTV2 A/S, like, previously, TV2, has a public-service mission to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes. These may be broadcast by means of radio equipment, in particular, satellite or cable systems. Rules governing the public-service obligations of TV2 A/S and TV2 are laid down by the Danish Minister for Culture.\n\n4.\n\n\nApart from the public broadcasters, commercial television broadcasters operate on the nationwide television broadcasting market in Denmark. These include, first, [Viasat] and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (“SBS”).\n\n5.\n\n\nTV2 was set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of DR, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers. The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike DR, TV2 would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.\n\n6.\n\n\nFollowing a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting AS/TvDanmark, another commercial broadcaster on the Danish market, the system for funding TV2 was examined by the Commission of the European Communities in its Decision 2004/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for [TV2] (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 1; “the TV2 I decision”). That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: licensing fees, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2 (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2 at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees for nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, “the measures concerned”). Lastly, the Commission’s investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2 to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2’s public-service programmes through those installations.\n\n7.\n\n\nAfter examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (now Article 107(1) TFEU). That conclusion was based on the finding that TV2’s funding system, which sought to compensate it for the cost of providing its public services, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [(C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415) (“the Altmark conditions”)].\n\n8.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission decided that the aid granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2, in the form of licence fees and the other measures described in the TV2 I decision, was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (now Article 106(2) TFEU), with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish Kroner (DKK) which it classified as overcompensation (recital 163 to and Article 1 of the TV2 I decision). It accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2 A/S (Article 2 of the TV2 I decision), which had in the meantime replaced TV2 (see paragraph 2 above).\n\n9.\n\n\nGiven that the recovery of aid referred to in Article 2 of the TV2 I decision rendered TV2 A/S insolvent, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission, by letter of 23 July 2004, of a planned recapitalisation of that company. That plan provided, so far as State-funded measures were concerned, for a capital injection of DKK 440 million, on the one hand, and the conversion into capital of a State loan of DKK 394 million, on the other. By its Decision C(2004) 3632 final of 6 October 2004, in State Aid Case No N 313/2004 relating to the recapitalisation of [TV2 A/S] (OJ 2005 C 172, p. 3; “the recapitalisation decision”), the Commission concluded that the two measures planned for TV2 A/S were “necessary to rebuild the capital which TV2 [A/S] need[ed], following its conversion into a limited company, to fulfil its public-service mission” (recital 53 of the recapitalisation decision). Consequently, the Commission decided that any element of State aid that might be connected with the planned recapitalisation of TV2 A/S was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (recital 55 to the recapitalisation decision).\n\n10.\n\n\nThe TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2 A/S (Case T‑309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T‑317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2 A/S, namely [Viasat] (Case T‑329/04) and SBS (Case T‑336/04).\n\n11.\n\n\nBy judgment of 22 October 2008in TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission [(T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457)], the Court annulled the TV2 I decision. [In paragraph 124 of that judgment], the Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that TV2’s public-service mission was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest ... It also found, however, several instances of illegality vitiating the TV2 I decision, which led, in short, to the annulment of that decision.\n\n12.\n\n\nThus, first, examining the question whether the measures concerned by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons for which it took advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, as State resources [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 160 to 167)]. Second, the Court found that the Commission’s examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the legal and economic considerations which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2. The TV2 I decision was, in consequence, vitiated by failure to state reasons on that point [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 224 to 233)]. Third, the Court held that the Commission’s conclusions on the examination of the compatibility of the aid in the light of Article 86(2) EC, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons. According to the Court, that inadequacy of the reasons stated was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the actual legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2 during the period under investigation [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 192, 197 to 203).\n\n13.\n\n\nThe recapitalisation decision was the subject of two actions for annulment, brought by SBS and by [Viasat]. By two orders delivered on 24 September 2009, the Court ruled that, in the light of the annulment of the TV2 I decision and the close link between the obligation to recover the aid resulting from that decision and the measures which are the subject of the recapitalisation decision, it was no longer necessary to rule on those cases [(orders of 24 September 2009, SBS TV and SBS Danish Television v Commission, T‑12/05, not published, EU:T:2009:357, and [of 24 September 2009,] Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, T‑16/05, not published, EU:T:2009:358)].\n\n14.\n\n\nFollowing the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned. On that occasion, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S and, furthermore, received observations from the third parties.\n\n15.\n\n\nThe Commission presented the result of its re-examination of the measures concerned in the contested decision, which is the subject of the present action and of another action brought by TV2 A/S [(TV2/Danmark v Commission, T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684)], in which the Court has delivered its judgment today.\n\n16.\n\n\nThe contested decision concerns the measures granted to TV2 between 1995 and 2002. However, in its analysis the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.\n\n17.\n\n\nIn the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU in favour of TV2 (recital 153 of the contested decision). First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources (recital 90 to the contested decision) and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, it concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions (recital 153 to the contested decision). However, whereas in the TV2 I decision it had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million was overcompensation incompatible with Article 86(2) EC, in the contested decision the Commission took the view that that sum was a capital buffer appropriate for TV2 A/S (recital 233 to the contested decision). In the operative part of the contested decision, it therefore declared as follows:\n\n“Article 1\n\nThe measures implemented by Denmark in favour of [TV2] between 1995 and 2002 in the form of the licence fee resources and other measures discussed in this Decision are compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 106(2) [TFEU].”’ \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n3\n\n\n By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 March 2012, Viasat sought annulment in part of the contested decision.\n\n4\n\n\nViasat claimed that the State aid granted to TV2 was incompatible with the internal market, raising two pleas in this connection. The first plea alleged an error of law committed by the Commission which, in assessing the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU, did not take into account the second and fourth Altmark conditions. The second plea alleged a failure by the Commission to fulfil its duty to state reasons in so far as that institution, without explaining the reasons for its decision, found that Article 106(2) TFEU applied in the present case, although the second and fourth Altmark conditions were not met.\n\n5\n\n\nBy the judgment under appeal, the General Court declared that it was unnecessary to adjudicate on the action, in so far as that action sought the annulment of the contested decision in that the Commission had found that the advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2 by the TV2 Fund amounted to State aid, and dismissed the action as to the remainder .\n\n6\n\n\n By its judgment of 24 September 2015, TV2/Danmark v Commission (T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684), the General Court, in an action brought by TV2, annulled the contested decision in so far as it had characterised as State Aid the advertising revenue received by TV2 for the years 1995 and 1996. \n\nThe forms of order sought\n\n7\n\n\n Viasat claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed its action and annul the contested decision, and order the Commission to pay the costs of the proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice; and\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, set aside judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the General Court for a decision and reserve the decision on costs. \n\n8\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs incurred at both instances. \n\n9\n\n\n The Kingdom of Denmark contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal.\n\n10\n\n\nTV2 A/S contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, dismiss the appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, maintain the effects of the judgment under appeal and of the contested decision; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs of TV2 A/S. \n\nThe request to reopen the oral procedure\n\n11\n\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Advocate General’s Opinion, Viasat, by letter of 3 January 2017, requested the Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure. In support of its request, Viasat submits that the Advocate General’s Opinion distorts some of its arguments and raises separate arguments which were not debated between the parties.\n\n12\n\n\nIt should be borne in mind that, according to Article 83 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that court may, at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n13\n\n\nHowever, the Statute and those Rules make no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk, C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).\n\n14\n\n\nIn that regard, it follows from the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU that it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which require his involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based. Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions examined in that Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraphs 60 and 61 and the case-law cited).\n\n15\n\n\nThe Court therefore considers, having heard the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary information to give judgment and that the information has been the subject of debate between the parties.\n\n16\n\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.\n\nThe appeal\n\nThe first plea, alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n17\n\n\nBy its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measures concerned in the light of the requirements set out in Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular those providing that, first, the application of the rules of the Treaties must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned and, secondly, the performance of those tasks must not affect the development of trade as would be contrary to the interests of the European Union, was not required to take into consideration the fact that those measures did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions. According to those conditions, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation for the performance of the public service is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner, and that compensation must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical and well run undertaking would have incurred in performing the public service tasks concerned.\n\n18\n\n\nViasat claims that it is apparent from the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU that the requirement that the application of the rules in the Treaties, in particular the competition rules, must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned must be interpreted so as to refer to the other provisions of the Treaty. Thus, in an assessment of the compatibility of State aid in the light of Article 106(2) TFEU, those other provisions must be examined beforehand. Therefore, in the present case it should, according to Viasat, have been ascertained in this connection whether or not the application of any of the Altmark conditions obstructed the performance of the public service tasks assigned to TV2. Had that examination taken place, the Commission would have concluded that the adoption, in favour of TV2, of measures meeting the second and fourth Altmark conditions would not have obstructed the performance of that task.\n\n19\n\n\nConsequently, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements that the performance of the tasks at issue must be obstructed and the development of trade cannot be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union, the Commission should have requested the Kingdom of Denmark to prove that complying with the second and fourth Altmark conditions would have prevented the performance of the tasks of general economic interest assigned to TV2. \n\n20\n\n\n The Commission, the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S contend that the first ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n21\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission was not required, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, to take the second and fourth Altmark conditions into consideration in order to ascertain whether compliance with those conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n22\n\n\nIn this connection it must be recalled that, for a national measure to be categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, there must, first, be an intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient and, fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).\n\n23\n\n\nSince those conditions are cumulative, a State measure cannot be characterised as State aid if one of them is not satisfied. By contrast, if all those conditions are met, that measure constitutes State aid and, accordingly, unless it is covered by a derogation provided for by the Treaties, is incompatible with the internal market.\n\n24\n\n\nSo far as concerns the third criterion for characterising a measure as State aid, it is settled case-law that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are regarded as State aid (see judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraph 34).\n\n25\n\n\nHowever, the Court has stated that, where a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations, so that those undertakings do not enjoy a real financial advantage and the measure thus does not have the effect of putting them in a more favourable competitive position than the undertakings competing with them, such a measure is not caught by Article 107(1) TFEU (see judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 87).\n\n26\n\n\nIn accordance with paragraphs 88 to 93 of the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), in order for such a measure not to be characterised as State aid a number of conditions must be met.  First, the recipient undertaking must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined.  Second, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner.  Third, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations.  Fourth, the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations.\n\n27\n\n\nIf the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph were not met, the State measure at issue would be deemed to confer a selective advantage on the recipient undertaking and if, moreover, the other criteria set out in Article 107(1) TFEU were met, that measure would constitute aid in principle incompatible with the internal market.\n\n28\n\n\nArticle 106(2) TFEU provides that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are to be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them and that the development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union.\n\n29\n\n\nAs is provided by case-law, the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU itself shows that exemptions to the Treaty rules are permitted provided that they are necessary for performance of the particular tasks assigned to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 54 and of 28 February 2013, Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas, C‑1/12, EU:C:2013:127, paragraph 106).\n\n30\n\n\nIn that regard, it is clear from the Court’s case-law that it is not necessary that the financial balance or economic viability of the undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest should be threatened.  It is sufficient that, in the absence of the rights at issue, it would not be possible for the undertaking to perform the particular tasks entrusted to it, or that maintenance of those rights is necessary to enable the holder of them to perform tasks of general economic interest which have been assigned to it under economically acceptable conditions (judgment of 15 November 2007, International Mail Spain, C‑162/06, EU:C:2007:681, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).\n\n31\n\n\nIn allowing derogations to be made from the general rules of the Treaty in certain circumstances, Article 106(2) TFEU seeks to reconcile the Member States’ interest in using certain undertakings, in particular in the public sector, as an instrument of economic or fiscal policy with the Union’s interest in ensuring compliance with the rules on competition and the preservation of the unity of the common market (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 55).\n\n32\n\n\nAs set out in paragraph 21 above, Viasat submits that the Commission was required to examine, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, whether meeting the second and the fourth Altmark conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n33\n\n\nIt must be pointed out in this connection that in order to assess a measure under Article 106(2) TFEU, the Commission is not required, contrary to what is claimed by the appellant, to examine whether the conditions laid down by the case-law in Altmark, in particular the second and fourth of those conditions, are met.\n\n34\n\n\nAs the General Court indeed held in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, verification of the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law occurs upstream, that is to say in the examination of the issue of whether the measures at issue must be characterised as State aid.  That issue must be resolved before the one which consists in examining, where necessary, if incompatible aid is nevertheless necessary to the performance of the tasks assigned to the recipient of the measure at issue, under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n35\n\n\nBy contrast, the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law are no longer to be applied where the Commission, having found that a measure must be characterised as aid, in particular in so far as the recipient undertaking is unable to pass the test of comparison with a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public-service requirements, examines whether that aid can be justified under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n36\n\nThat latter provision, which is supplemented by the Protocol (No. 26) on Services of General Interest (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 308) and, as regards the field at issue in the present case, by the Protocol (No. 29) on the System of Public Broadcasting in the Member States (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 312), cannot be interpreted in isolation having regard merely to its wording without also taking into account the additional information in those protocols.\n\n37\n\n\nThe finding in paragraph 35 of the present judgment is supported, as the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, by the wording of Protocol No. 29, which states that ‘the provisions of the Treaties shall be without prejudice to the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting and in so far as such funding is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of the public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and in so far as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Union to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest, while the realisation of the remit of that public service shall be taken into account.’\n\n38\n\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, the General Court therefore did not err in law when it held in the judgment under appeal that Article 106(2) TFEU does not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision.\n\n39\n\n\nThe first ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.\n\nThe second ground of appeal, alleging breach of Article 296 TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n40\n\n\nBy its second ground of appeal, Viasat takes issue with paragraphs 103 and 104 of the judgment under appeal on the ground that the General Court erred in law by rejecting its plea for annulment based on the Commission’s infringement in the contested decision of its obligation to state reasons under Article 296 TFEU.\n\n41\n\n\nViasat also alleges that the General Court failed to reply to the pleas raised in the application at first instance.\n42\n\n\nThe Commission contends that the second ground of appeal is in part inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n43\n\nIt is settled case-law that the statement of reasons required under Article 296 TFEU must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the competent Court of the European Union to exercise its jurisdiction to review legality (judgment of 29 September 2011, Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C‑521/09 P, EU:C:2011:620, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited).\n\n44\n\n\nIt must be observed in this connection that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the plea alleging a failure to state reasons in the contested decision by stating that ‘the fact that the contested decision does not mention the role of the second and fourth Altmark conditions in the assessment of the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market is not attributable to an error of reasoning on the part of the Commission or to a failure to state reasons vitiating the contested decision, but rather to the fact that that decision applies a different analytical framework from that which favours [Viasat]’.\n\n45\n\n\nAs Viasat has conceded, the contested decision would only be vitiated by a failure to state reasons if the Commission had been required to apply the analytical framework which, according to Viasat, results from Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n46\n\n\nHowever, it follows from paragraph 37 above that Article 106(2) TFEU did not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision. Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in holding that sufficient reasons were stated for the contested decision.\n\n47\n\n\nMoreover, as the Advocate General observed in point 58 of his Opinion, the complaint alleging a failure to respond to the pleas raised in the application at first instance is insufficiently developed for the other parties to the appeal to respond to or for the Court to rule on. Consequently, it is inadmissible.\n\n48\n\n\n Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected as in part inadmissible and in part unfounded.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.\n\nCosts\n\n50\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which apply to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n51\n\n\nSince the Commission and TV2 A/S have applied for costs and Viasat has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay their costs.\n\n52\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure, also applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those Rules, the Member States and institutions which intervene in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.\n\n53\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark, as an intervener before the General Court, is to bear its own costs.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal;\n\n\n2.\n\n\nOrders Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd to pay the costs incurred by the European Commission and TV2/Danmark A/S; \n\n\n3.\n\n\nDeclares that the Kingdom of Denmark is to bear its own costs.\n\n\nSilva de Lapuerta\n\nRegan\n\nBonichot\n\nArabadjiev\n\nFernlund\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 8 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\n after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 10 November 2016, \n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd (‘Viasat’) seeks to have set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 24 September 2015, Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission (T‑125/12, EU:T:2015:687) (‘the judgment under appeal’), by which that court dismissed its action directed against Commission Decision 2011/839/EU of 20 April 2011 on the measures implemented by Denmark (C 2/03) for TV2/Danmark (OJ 2011 L 340, p. 1) (‘the contested decision’), by which the European Commission, while recognising that certain measures adopted by the Kingdom of Denmark in favour of TV2/Danmark (‘TV2’) had the character of State aid, decided that those measures were to be regarded as compatible with the internal market on the basis of Article 106(2) TFEU. \n\n Background to the dispute\n\n2\n\n\nThe General Court set out the background to the dispute in paragraphs 1 to 17 of the judgment under appeal in the following terms:\n\n‘1.\n\n\nThe subject-matter of this action is a claim for annulment, in part, of [the contested decision] in that it finds that [the measures implemented by Denmark for TV2/Danmark], although amounting to State aid, are nevertheless compatible with the internal market, within the meaning of Article 106(2) TFEU. The action has been brought by [Viasat], which is a commercial broadcasting company active on the Danish market and a direct competitor of the Danish broadcasting company TV2/Danmark A/S (“TV2 A/S”).\n\n2.\n\n\nTV2 A/S was created in order to replace, for accounting and tax purposes as of 1 January 2003, the autonomous State undertaking [TV2], established in 1986, by the Lov No 335 om ændring af lov om radio-og fjernsynsvirksomhed ... [(Law No 335 amending the Law on Broadcasting Services) of 4 June 1986]. TV2 A/S is, as was its predecessor TV2, the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio (“DR”).\n\n3.\n\n\nTV2 A/S, like, previously, TV2, has a public-service mission to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes. These may be broadcast by means of radio equipment, in particular, satellite or cable systems. Rules governing the public-service obligations of TV2 A/S and TV2 are laid down by the Danish Minister for Culture.\n\n4.\n\n\nApart from the public broadcasters, commercial television broadcasters operate on the nationwide television broadcasting market in Denmark. These include, first, [Viasat] and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (“SBS”).\n\n5.\n\n\nTV2 was set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of DR, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers. The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike DR, TV2 would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.\n\n6.\n\n\nFollowing a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting AS/TvDanmark, another commercial broadcaster on the Danish market, the system for funding TV2 was examined by the Commission of the European Communities in its Decision 2004/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for [TV2] (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 1; “the TV2 I decision”). That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: licensing fees, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2 (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2 at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees for nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, “the measures concerned”). Lastly, the Commission’s investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2 to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2’s public-service programmes through those installations.\n\n7.\n\n\nAfter examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (now Article 107(1) TFEU). That conclusion was based on the finding that TV2’s funding system, which sought to compensate it for the cost of providing its public services, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [(C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415) (“the Altmark conditions”)].\n\n8.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission decided that the aid granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2, in the form of licence fees and the other measures described in the TV2 I decision, was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (now Article 106(2) TFEU), with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish Kroner (DKK) which it classified as overcompensation (recital 163 to and Article 1 of the TV2 I decision). It accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2 A/S (Article 2 of the TV2 I decision), which had in the meantime replaced TV2 (see paragraph 2 above).\n\n9.\n\n\nGiven that the recovery of aid referred to in Article 2 of the TV2 I decision rendered TV2 A/S insolvent, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission, by letter of 23 July 2004, of a planned recapitalisation of that company. That plan provided, so far as State-funded measures were concerned, for a capital injection of DKK 440 million, on the one hand, and the conversion into capital of a State loan of DKK 394 million, on the other. By its Decision C(2004) 3632 final of 6 October 2004, in State Aid Case No N 313/2004 relating to the recapitalisation of [TV2 A/S] (OJ 2005 C 172, p. 3; “the recapitalisation decision”), the Commission concluded that the two measures planned for TV2 A/S were “necessary to rebuild the capital which TV2 [A/S] need[ed], following its conversion into a limited company, to fulfil its public-service mission” (recital 53 of the recapitalisation decision). Consequently, the Commission decided that any element of State aid that might be connected with the planned recapitalisation of TV2 A/S was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (recital 55 to the recapitalisation decision).\n\n10.\n\n\nThe TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2 A/S (Case T‑309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T‑317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2 A/S, namely [Viasat] (Case T‑329/04) and SBS (Case T‑336/04).\n\n11.\n\n\nBy judgment of 22 October 2008in TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission [(T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457)], the Court annulled the TV2 I decision. [In paragraph 124 of that judgment], the Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that TV2’s public-service mission was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest ... It also found, however, several instances of illegality vitiating the TV2 I decision, which led, in short, to the annulment of that decision.\n\n12.\n\n\nThus, first, examining the question whether the measures concerned by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons for which it took advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, as State resources [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 160 to 167)]. Second, the Court found that the Commission’s examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the legal and economic considerations which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2. The TV2 I decision was, in consequence, vitiated by failure to state reasons on that point [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 224 to 233)]. Third, the Court held that the Commission’s conclusions on the examination of the compatibility of the aid in the light of Article 86(2) EC, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons. According to the Court, that inadequacy of the reasons stated was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the actual legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2 during the period under investigation [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 192, 197 to 203).\n\n13.\n\n\nThe recapitalisation decision was the subject of two actions for annulment, brought by SBS and by [Viasat]. By two orders delivered on 24 September 2009, the Court ruled that, in the light of the annulment of the TV2 I decision and the close link between the obligation to recover the aid resulting from that decision and the measures which are the subject of the recapitalisation decision, it was no longer necessary to rule on those cases [(orders of 24 September 2009, SBS TV and SBS Danish Television v Commission, T‑12/05, not published, EU:T:2009:357, and [of 24 September 2009,] Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, T‑16/05, not published, EU:T:2009:358)].\n\n14.\n\n\nFollowing the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned. On that occasion, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S and, furthermore, received observations from the third parties.\n\n15.\n\n\nThe Commission presented the result of its re-examination of the measures concerned in the contested decision, which is the subject of the present action and of another action brought by TV2 A/S [(TV2/Danmark v Commission, T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684)], in which the Court has delivered its judgment today.\n\n16.\n\n\nThe contested decision concerns the measures granted to TV2 between 1995 and 2002. However, in its analysis the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.\n\n17.\n\n\nIn the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU in favour of TV2 (recital 153 of the contested decision). First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources (recital 90 to the contested decision) and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, it concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions (recital 153 to the contested decision). However, whereas in the TV2 I decision it had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million was overcompensation incompatible with Article 86(2) EC, in the contested decision the Commission took the view that that sum was a capital buffer appropriate for TV2 A/S (recital 233 to the contested decision). In the operative part of the contested decision, it therefore declared as follows:\n\n“Article 1\n\nThe measures implemented by Denmark in favour of [TV2] between 1995 and 2002 in the form of the licence fee resources and other measures discussed in this Decision are compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 106(2) [TFEU].”’ \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n3\n\n\n By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 March 2012, Viasat sought annulment in part of the contested decision.\n\n4\n\n\nViasat claimed that the State aid granted to TV2 was incompatible with the internal market, raising two pleas in this connection. The first plea alleged an error of law committed by the Commission which, in assessing the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU, did not take into account the second and fourth Altmark conditions. The second plea alleged a failure by the Commission to fulfil its duty to state reasons in so far as that institution, without explaining the reasons for its decision, found that Article 106(2) TFEU applied in the present case, although the second and fourth Altmark conditions were not met.\n\n5\n\n\nBy the judgment under appeal, the General Court declared that it was unnecessary to adjudicate on the action, in so far as that action sought the annulment of the contested decision in that the Commission had found that the advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2 by the TV2 Fund amounted to State aid, and dismissed the action as to the remainder .\n\n6\n\n\n By its judgment of 24 September 2015, TV2/Danmark v Commission (T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684), the General Court, in an action brought by TV2, annulled the contested decision in so far as it had characterised as State Aid the advertising revenue received by TV2 for the years 1995 and 1996. \n\nThe forms of order sought\n\n7\n\n\n Viasat claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed its action and annul the contested decision, and order the Commission to pay the costs of the proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice; and\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, set aside judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the General Court for a decision and reserve the decision on costs. \n\n8\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs incurred at both instances. \n\n9\n\n\n The Kingdom of Denmark contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal.\n\n10\n\n\nTV2 A/S contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, dismiss the appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, maintain the effects of the judgment under appeal and of the contested decision; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs of TV2 A/S. \n\nThe request to reopen the oral procedure\n\n11\n\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Advocate General’s Opinion, Viasat, by letter of 3 January 2017, requested the Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure. In support of its request, Viasat submits that the Advocate General’s Opinion distorts some of its arguments and raises separate arguments which were not debated between the parties.\n\n12\n\n\nIt should be borne in mind that, according to Article 83 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that court may, at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n13\n\n\nHowever, the Statute and those Rules make no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk, C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).\n\n14\n\n\nIn that regard, it follows from the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU that it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which require his involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based. Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions examined in that Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraphs 60 and 61 and the case-law cited).\n\n15\n\n\nThe Court therefore considers, having heard the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary information to give judgment and that the information has been the subject of debate between the parties.\n\n16\n\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.\n\nThe appeal\n\nThe first plea, alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n17\n\n\nBy its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measures concerned in the light of the requirements set out in Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular those providing that, first, the application of the rules of the Treaties must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned and, secondly, the performance of those tasks must not affect the development of trade as would be contrary to the interests of the European Union, was not required to take into consideration the fact that those measures did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions. According to those conditions, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation for the performance of the public service is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner, and that compensation must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical and well run undertaking would have incurred in performing the public service tasks concerned.\n\n18\n\n\nViasat claims that it is apparent from the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU that the requirement that the application of the rules in the Treaties, in particular the competition rules, must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned must be interpreted so as to refer to the other provisions of the Treaty. Thus, in an assessment of the compatibility of State aid in the light of Article 106(2) TFEU, those other provisions must be examined beforehand. Therefore, in the present case it should, according to Viasat, have been ascertained in this connection whether or not the application of any of the Altmark conditions obstructed the performance of the public service tasks assigned to TV2. Had that examination taken place, the Commission would have concluded that the adoption, in favour of TV2, of measures meeting the second and fourth Altmark conditions would not have obstructed the performance of that task.\n\n19\n\n\nConsequently, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements that the performance of the tasks at issue must be obstructed and the development of trade cannot be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union, the Commission should have requested the Kingdom of Denmark to prove that complying with the second and fourth Altmark conditions would have prevented the performance of the tasks of general economic interest assigned to TV2. \n\n20\n\n\n The Commission, the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S contend that the first ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n21\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission was not required, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, to take the second and fourth Altmark conditions into consideration in order to ascertain whether compliance with those conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n22\n\n\nIn this connection it must be recalled that, for a national measure to be categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, there must, first, be an intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient and, fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).\n\n23\n\n\nSince those conditions are cumulative, a State measure cannot be characterised as State aid if one of them is not satisfied. By contrast, if all those conditions are met, that measure constitutes State aid and, accordingly, unless it is covered by a derogation provided for by the Treaties, is incompatible with the internal market.\n\n24\n\n\nSo far as concerns the third criterion for characterising a measure as State aid, it is settled case-law that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are regarded as State aid (see judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraph 34).\n\n25\n\n\nHowever, the Court has stated that, where a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations, so that those undertakings do not enjoy a real financial advantage and the measure thus does not have the effect of putting them in a more favourable competitive position than the undertakings competing with them, such a measure is not caught by Article 107(1) TFEU (see judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 87).\n\n26\n\n\nIn accordance with paragraphs 88 to 93 of the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), in order for such a measure not to be characterised as State aid a number of conditions must be met.  First, the recipient undertaking must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined.  Second, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner.  Third, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations.  Fourth, the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations.\n\n27\n\n\nIf the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph were not met, the State measure at issue would be deemed to confer a selective advantage on the recipient undertaking and if, moreover, the other criteria set out in Article 107(1) TFEU were met, that measure would constitute aid in principle incompatible with the internal market.\n\n28\n\n\nArticle 106(2) TFEU provides that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are to be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them and that the development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union.\n\n29\n\n\nAs is provided by case-law, the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU itself shows that exemptions to the Treaty rules are permitted provided that they are necessary for performance of the particular tasks assigned to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 54 and of 28 February 2013, Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas, C‑1/12, EU:C:2013:127, paragraph 106).\n\n30\n\n\nIn that regard, it is clear from the Court’s case-law that it is not necessary that the financial balance or economic viability of the undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest should be threatened.  It is sufficient that, in the absence of the rights at issue, it would not be possible for the undertaking to perform the particular tasks entrusted to it, or that maintenance of those rights is necessary to enable the holder of them to perform tasks of general economic interest which have been assigned to it under economically acceptable conditions (judgment of 15 November 2007, International Mail Spain, C‑162/06, EU:C:2007:681, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).\n\n31\n\n\nIn allowing derogations to be made from the general rules of the Treaty in certain circumstances, Article 106(2) TFEU seeks to reconcile the Member States’ interest in using certain undertakings, in particular in the public sector, as an instrument of economic or fiscal policy with the Union’s interest in ensuring compliance with the rules on competition and the preservation of the unity of the common market (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 55).\n\n32\n\n\nAs set out in paragraph 21 above, Viasat submits that the Commission was required to examine, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, whether meeting the second and the fourth Altmark conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n33\n\n\nIt must be pointed out in this connection that in order to assess a measure under Article 106(2) TFEU, the Commission is not required, contrary to what is claimed by the appellant, to examine whether the conditions laid down by the case-law in Altmark, in particular the second and fourth of those conditions, are met.\n\n34\n\n\nAs the General Court indeed held in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, verification of the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law occurs upstream, that is to say in the examination of the issue of whether the measures at issue must be characterised as State aid.  That issue must be resolved before the one which consists in examining, where necessary, if incompatible aid is nevertheless necessary to the performance of the tasks assigned to the recipient of the measure at issue, under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n35\n\n\nBy contrast, the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law are no longer to be applied where the Commission, having found that a measure must be characterised as aid, in particular in so far as the recipient undertaking is unable to pass the test of comparison with a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public-service requirements, examines whether that aid can be justified under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n36\n\nThat latter provision, which is supplemented by the Protocol (No. 26) on Services of General Interest (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 308) and, as regards the field at issue in the present case, by the Protocol (No. 29) on the System of Public Broadcasting in the Member States (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 312), cannot be interpreted in isolation having regard merely to its wording without also taking into account the additional information in those protocols.\n\n37\n\n\nThe finding in paragraph 35 of the present judgment is supported, as the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, by the wording of Protocol No. 29, which states that ‘the provisions of the Treaties shall be without prejudice to the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting and in so far as such funding is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of the public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and in so far as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Union to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest, while the realisation of the remit of that public service shall be taken into account.’\n\n38\n\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, the General Court therefore did not err in law when it held in the judgment under appeal that Article 106(2) TFEU does not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision.\n\n39\n\n\nThe first ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.\n\nThe second ground of appeal, alleging breach of Article 296 TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n40\n\n\nBy its second ground of appeal, Viasat takes issue with paragraphs 103 and 104 of the judgment under appeal on the ground that the General Court erred in law by rejecting its plea for annulment based on the Commission’s infringement in the contested decision of its obligation to state reasons under Article 296 TFEU.\n\n41\n\n\nViasat also alleges that the General Court failed to reply to the pleas raised in the application at first instance.\n42\n\n\nThe Commission contends that the second ground of appeal is in part inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n43\n\nIt is settled case-law that the statement of reasons required under Article 296 TFEU must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the competent Court of the European Union to exercise its jurisdiction to review legality (judgment of 29 September 2011, Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C‑521/09 P, EU:C:2011:620, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited).\n\n44\n\n\nIt must be observed in this connection that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the plea alleging a failure to state reasons in the contested decision by stating that ‘the fact that the contested decision does not mention the role of the second and fourth Altmark conditions in the assessment of the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market is not attributable to an error of reasoning on the part of the Commission or to a failure to state reasons vitiating the contested decision, but rather to the fact that that decision applies a different analytical framework from that which favours [Viasat]’.\n\n45\n\n\nAs Viasat has conceded, the contested decision would only be vitiated by a failure to state reasons if the Commission had been required to apply the analytical framework which, according to Viasat, results from Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n46\n\n\nHowever, it follows from paragraph 37 above that Article 106(2) TFEU did not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision. Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in holding that sufficient reasons were stated for the contested decision.\n\n47\n\n\nMoreover, as the Advocate General observed in point 58 of his Opinion, the complaint alleging a failure to respond to the pleas raised in the application at first instance is insufficiently developed for the other parties to the appeal to respond to or for the Court to rule on. Consequently, it is inadmissible.\n\n48\n\n\n Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected as in part inadmissible and in part unfounded.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.\n\nCosts\n\n50\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which apply to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n51\n\n\nSince the Commission and TV2 A/S have applied for costs and Viasat has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay their costs.\n\n52\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure, also applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those Rules, the Member States and institutions which intervene in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.\n\n53\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark, as an intervener before the General Court, is to bear its own costs.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal;\n\n\n2.\n\n\nOrders Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd to pay the costs incurred by the European Commission and TV2/Danmark A/S; \n\n\n3.\n\n\nDeclares that the Kingdom of Denmark is to bear its own costs.\n\n\nSilva de Lapuerta\n\nRegan\n\nBonichot\n\nArabadjiev\n\nFernlund\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 8 March 2017.\n\nA.

Calot Escobar,\n\nhaving regard to the written procedure,\n\n after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 10 November 2016, \n\ngives the following\n\nJudgment\n\n1\n\n\n By its appeal, Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd (‘Viasat’) seeks to have set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 24 September 2015, Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission (T‑125/12, EU:T:2015:687) (‘the judgment under appeal’), by which that court dismissed its action directed against Commission Decision 2011/839/EU of 20 April 2011 on the measures implemented by Denmark (C 2/03) for TV2/Danmark (OJ 2011 L 340, p. 1) (‘the contested decision’), by which the European Commission, while recognising that certain measures adopted by the Kingdom of Denmark in favour of TV2/Danmark (‘TV2’) had the character of State aid, decided that those measures were to be regarded as compatible with the internal market on the basis of Article 106(2) TFEU. \n\n Background to the dispute\n\n2\n\n\nThe General Court set out the background to the dispute in paragraphs 1 to 17 of the judgment under appeal in the following terms:\n\n‘1.\n\n\nThe subject-matter of this action is a claim for annulment, in part, of [the contested decision] in that it finds that [the measures implemented by Denmark for TV2/Danmark], although amounting to State aid, are nevertheless compatible with the internal market, within the meaning of Article 106(2) TFEU. The action has been brought by [Viasat], which is a commercial broadcasting company active on the Danish market and a direct competitor of the Danish broadcasting company TV2/Danmark A/S (“TV2 A/S”).\n\n2.\n\n\nTV2 A/S was created in order to replace, for accounting and tax purposes as of 1 January 2003, the autonomous State undertaking [TV2], established in 1986, by the Lov No 335 om ændring af lov om radio-og fjernsynsvirksomhed ... [(Law No 335 amending the Law on Broadcasting Services) of 4 June 1986]. TV2 A/S is, as was its predecessor TV2, the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio (“DR”).\n\n3.\n\n\nTV2 A/S, like, previously, TV2, has a public-service mission to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes. These may be broadcast by means of radio equipment, in particular, satellite or cable systems. Rules governing the public-service obligations of TV2 A/S and TV2 are laid down by the Danish Minister for Culture.\n\n4.\n\n\nApart from the public broadcasters, commercial television broadcasters operate on the nationwide television broadcasting market in Denmark. These include, first, [Viasat] and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (“SBS”).\n\n5.\n\n\nTV2 was set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of DR, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers. The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike DR, TV2 would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.\n\n6.\n\n\nFollowing a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting AS/TvDanmark, another commercial broadcaster on the Danish market, the system for funding TV2 was examined by the Commission of the European Communities in its Decision 2004/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for [TV2] (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 1; “the TV2 I decision”). That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: licensing fees, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2 (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2 at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees for nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, “the measures concerned”). Lastly, the Commission’s investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2 to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2’s public-service programmes through those installations.\n\n7.\n\n\nAfter examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (now Article 107(1) TFEU). That conclusion was based on the finding that TV2’s funding system, which sought to compensate it for the cost of providing its public services, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [(C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415) (“the Altmark conditions”)].\n\n8.\n\n\nIn addition, the Commission decided that the aid granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2, in the form of licence fees and the other measures described in the TV2 I decision, was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (now Article 106(2) TFEU), with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish Kroner (DKK) which it classified as overcompensation (recital 163 to and Article 1 of the TV2 I decision). It accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2 A/S (Article 2 of the TV2 I decision), which had in the meantime replaced TV2 (see paragraph 2 above).\n\n9.\n\n\nGiven that the recovery of aid referred to in Article 2 of the TV2 I decision rendered TV2 A/S insolvent, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission, by letter of 23 July 2004, of a planned recapitalisation of that company. That plan provided, so far as State-funded measures were concerned, for a capital injection of DKK 440 million, on the one hand, and the conversion into capital of a State loan of DKK 394 million, on the other. By its Decision C(2004) 3632 final of 6 October 2004, in State Aid Case No N 313/2004 relating to the recapitalisation of [TV2 A/S] (OJ 2005 C 172, p. 3; “the recapitalisation decision”), the Commission concluded that the two measures planned for TV2 A/S were “necessary to rebuild the capital which TV2 [A/S] need[ed], following its conversion into a limited company, to fulfil its public-service mission” (recital 53 of the recapitalisation decision). Consequently, the Commission decided that any element of State aid that might be connected with the planned recapitalisation of TV2 A/S was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (recital 55 to the recapitalisation decision).\n\n10.\n\n\nThe TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2 A/S (Case T‑309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T‑317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2 A/S, namely [Viasat] (Case T‑329/04) and SBS (Case T‑336/04).\n\n11.\n\n\nBy judgment of 22 October 2008in TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission [(T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457)], the Court annulled the TV2 I decision. [In paragraph 124 of that judgment], the Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that TV2’s public-service mission was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest ... It also found, however, several instances of illegality vitiating the TV2 I decision, which led, in short, to the annulment of that decision.\n\n12.\n\n\nThus, first, examining the question whether the measures concerned by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons for which it took advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, as State resources [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 160 to 167)]. Second, the Court found that the Commission’s examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the legal and economic considerations which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2. The TV2 I decision was, in consequence, vitiated by failure to state reasons on that point [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 224 to 233)]. Third, the Court held that the Commission’s conclusions on the examination of the compatibility of the aid in the light of Article 86(2) EC, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons. According to the Court, that inadequacy of the reasons stated was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the actual legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2 during the period under investigation [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 192, 197 to 203).\n\n13.\n\n\nThe recapitalisation decision was the subject of two actions for annulment, brought by SBS and by [Viasat]. By two orders delivered on 24 September 2009, the Court ruled that, in the light of the annulment of the TV2 I decision and the close link between the obligation to recover the aid resulting from that decision and the measures which are the subject of the recapitalisation decision, it was no longer necessary to rule on those cases [(orders of 24 September 2009, SBS TV and SBS Danish Television v Commission, T‑12/05, not published, EU:T:2009:357, and [of 24 September 2009,] Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, T‑16/05, not published, EU:T:2009:358)].\n\n14.\n\n\nFollowing the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned. On that occasion, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S and, furthermore, received observations from the third parties.\n\n15.\n\n\nThe Commission presented the result of its re-examination of the measures concerned in the contested decision, which is the subject of the present action and of another action brought by TV2 A/S [(TV2/Danmark v Commission, T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684)], in which the Court has delivered its judgment today.\n\n16.\n\n\nThe contested decision concerns the measures granted to TV2 between 1995 and 2002. However, in its analysis the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.\n\n17.\n\n\nIn the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU in favour of TV2 (recital 153 of the contested decision). First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources (recital 90 to the contested decision) and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, it concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions (recital 153 to the contested decision). However, whereas in the TV2 I decision it had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million was overcompensation incompatible with Article 86(2) EC, in the contested decision the Commission took the view that that sum was a capital buffer appropriate for TV2 A/S (recital 233 to the contested decision). In the operative part of the contested decision, it therefore declared as follows:\n\n“Article 1\n\nThe measures implemented by Denmark in favour of [TV2] between 1995 and 2002 in the form of the licence fee resources and other measures discussed in this Decision are compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 106(2) [TFEU].”’ \n\n The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal\n\n3\n\n\n By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 March 2012, Viasat sought annulment in part of the contested decision.\n\n4\n\n\nViasat claimed that the State aid granted to TV2 was incompatible with the internal market, raising two pleas in this connection. The first plea alleged an error of law committed by the Commission which, in assessing the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU, did not take into account the second and fourth Altmark conditions. The second plea alleged a failure by the Commission to fulfil its duty to state reasons in so far as that institution, without explaining the reasons for its decision, found that Article 106(2) TFEU applied in the present case, although the second and fourth Altmark conditions were not met.\n\n5\n\n\nBy the judgment under appeal, the General Court declared that it was unnecessary to adjudicate on the action, in so far as that action sought the annulment of the contested decision in that the Commission had found that the advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2 by the TV2 Fund amounted to State aid, and dismissed the action as to the remainder .\n\n6\n\n\n By its judgment of 24 September 2015, TV2/Danmark v Commission (T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684), the General Court, in an action brought by TV2, annulled the contested decision in so far as it had characterised as State Aid the advertising revenue received by TV2 for the years 1995 and 1996. \n\nThe forms of order sought\n\n7\n\n\n Viasat claims that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed its action and annul the contested decision, and order the Commission to pay the costs of the proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice; and\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, set aside judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the General Court for a decision and reserve the decision on costs. \n\n8\n\n\n The Commission contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\ndismiss the appeal; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs incurred at both instances. \n\n9\n\n\n The Kingdom of Denmark contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal.\n\n10\n\n\nTV2 A/S contends that the Court should:\n\n—\n\n\nprimarily, dismiss the appeal;\n\n—\n\n\nin the alternative, maintain the effects of the judgment under appeal and of the contested decision; and\n\n—\n\n\norder Viasat to pay the costs of TV2 A/S. \n\nThe request to reopen the oral procedure\n\n11\n\n\nFollowing the delivery of the Advocate General’s Opinion, Viasat, by letter of 3 January 2017, requested the Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure. In support of its request, Viasat submits that the Advocate General’s Opinion distorts some of its arguments and raises separate arguments which were not debated between the parties.\n\n12\n\n\nIt should be borne in mind that, according to Article 83 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that court may, at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\n13\n\n\nHowever, the Statute and those Rules make no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk, C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).\n\n14\n\n\nIn that regard, it follows from the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU that it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which require his involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based. Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions examined in that Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraphs 60 and 61 and the case-law cited).\n\n15\n\n\nThe Court therefore considers, having heard the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary information to give judgment and that the information has been the subject of debate between the parties.\n\n16\n\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.\n\nThe appeal\n\nThe first plea, alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n17\n\n\nBy its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measures concerned in the light of the requirements set out in Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular those providing that, first, the application of the rules of the Treaties must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned and, secondly, the performance of those tasks must not affect the development of trade as would be contrary to the interests of the European Union, was not required to take into consideration the fact that those measures did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions. According to those conditions, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation for the performance of the public service is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner, and that compensation must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical and well run undertaking would have incurred in performing the public service tasks concerned.\n\n18\n\n\nViasat claims that it is apparent from the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU that the requirement that the application of the rules in the Treaties, in particular the competition rules, must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned must be interpreted so as to refer to the other provisions of the Treaty. Thus, in an assessment of the compatibility of State aid in the light of Article 106(2) TFEU, those other provisions must be examined beforehand. Therefore, in the present case it should, according to Viasat, have been ascertained in this connection whether or not the application of any of the Altmark conditions obstructed the performance of the public service tasks assigned to TV2. Had that examination taken place, the Commission would have concluded that the adoption, in favour of TV2, of measures meeting the second and fourth Altmark conditions would not have obstructed the performance of that task.\n\n19\n\n\nConsequently, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements that the performance of the tasks at issue must be obstructed and the development of trade cannot be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union, the Commission should have requested the Kingdom of Denmark to prove that complying with the second and fourth Altmark conditions would have prevented the performance of the tasks of general economic interest assigned to TV2. \n\n20\n\n\n The Commission, the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S contend that the first ground of appeal is unfounded. \n\nFindings of the Court\n\n21\n\n\n By its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission was not required, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, to take the second and fourth Altmark conditions into consideration in order to ascertain whether compliance with those conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n22\n\n\nIn this connection it must be recalled that, for a national measure to be categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, there must, first, be an intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient and, fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).\n\n23\n\n\nSince those conditions are cumulative, a State measure cannot be characterised as State aid if one of them is not satisfied. By contrast, if all those conditions are met, that measure constitutes State aid and, accordingly, unless it is covered by a derogation provided for by the Treaties, is incompatible with the internal market.\n\n24\n\n\nSo far as concerns the third criterion for characterising a measure as State aid, it is settled case-law that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are regarded as State aid (see judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraph 34).\n\n25\n\n\nHowever, the Court has stated that, where a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations, so that those undertakings do not enjoy a real financial advantage and the measure thus does not have the effect of putting them in a more favourable competitive position than the undertakings competing with them, such a measure is not caught by Article 107(1) TFEU (see judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 87).\n\n26\n\n\nIn accordance with paragraphs 88 to 93 of the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), in order for such a measure not to be characterised as State aid a number of conditions must be met.  First, the recipient undertaking must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined.  Second, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner.  Third, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations.  Fourth, the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations.\n\n27\n\n\nIf the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph were not met, the State measure at issue would be deemed to confer a selective advantage on the recipient undertaking and if, moreover, the other criteria set out in Article 107(1) TFEU were met, that measure would constitute aid in principle incompatible with the internal market.\n\n28\n\n\nArticle 106(2) TFEU provides that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are to be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them and that the development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union.\n\n29\n\n\nAs is provided by case-law, the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU itself shows that exemptions to the Treaty rules are permitted provided that they are necessary for performance of the particular tasks assigned to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 54 and of 28 February 2013, Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas, C‑1/12, EU:C:2013:127, paragraph 106).\n\n30\n\n\nIn that regard, it is clear from the Court’s case-law that it is not necessary that the financial balance or economic viability of the undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest should be threatened.  It is sufficient that, in the absence of the rights at issue, it would not be possible for the undertaking to perform the particular tasks entrusted to it, or that maintenance of those rights is necessary to enable the holder of them to perform tasks of general economic interest which have been assigned to it under economically acceptable conditions (judgment of 15 November 2007, International Mail Spain, C‑162/06, EU:C:2007:681, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).\n\n31\n\n\nIn allowing derogations to be made from the general rules of the Treaty in certain circumstances, Article 106(2) TFEU seeks to reconcile the Member States’ interest in using certain undertakings, in particular in the public sector, as an instrument of economic or fiscal policy with the Union’s interest in ensuring compliance with the rules on competition and the preservation of the unity of the common market (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 55).\n\n32\n\n\nAs set out in paragraph 21 above, Viasat submits that the Commission was required to examine, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, whether meeting the second and the fourth Altmark conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.\n\n33\n\n\nIt must be pointed out in this connection that in order to assess a measure under Article 106(2) TFEU, the Commission is not required, contrary to what is claimed by the appellant, to examine whether the conditions laid down by the case-law in Altmark, in particular the second and fourth of those conditions, are met.\n\n34\n\n\nAs the General Court indeed held in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, verification of the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law occurs upstream, that is to say in the examination of the issue of whether the measures at issue must be characterised as State aid.  That issue must be resolved before the one which consists in examining, where necessary, if incompatible aid is nevertheless necessary to the performance of the tasks assigned to the recipient of the measure at issue, under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n35\n\n\nBy contrast, the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law are no longer to be applied where the Commission, having found that a measure must be characterised as aid, in particular in so far as the recipient undertaking is unable to pass the test of comparison with a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public-service requirements, examines whether that aid can be justified under Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n36\n\nThat latter provision, which is supplemented by the Protocol (No. 26) on Services of General Interest (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 308) and, as regards the field at issue in the present case, by the Protocol (No. 29) on the System of Public Broadcasting in the Member States (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 312), cannot be interpreted in isolation having regard merely to its wording without also taking into account the additional information in those protocols.\n\n37\n\n\nThe finding in paragraph 35 of the present judgment is supported, as the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, by the wording of Protocol No. 29, which states that ‘the provisions of the Treaties shall be without prejudice to the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting and in so far as such funding is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of the public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and in so far as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Union to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest, while the realisation of the remit of that public service shall be taken into account.’\n\n38\n\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing considerations, the General Court therefore did not err in law when it held in the judgment under appeal that Article 106(2) TFEU does not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision.\n\n39\n\n\nThe first ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.\n\nThe second ground of appeal, alleging breach of Article 296 TFEU\n\nArguments of the parties\n\n40\n\n\nBy its second ground of appeal, Viasat takes issue with paragraphs 103 and 104 of the judgment under appeal on the ground that the General Court erred in law by rejecting its plea for annulment based on the Commission’s infringement in the contested decision of its obligation to state reasons under Article 296 TFEU.\n\n41\n\n\nViasat also alleges that the General Court failed to reply to the pleas raised in the application at first instance.\n42\n\n\nThe Commission contends that the second ground of appeal is in part inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.\n\nFindings of the Court\n\n43\n\nIt is settled case-law that the statement of reasons required under Article 296 TFEU must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the competent Court of the European Union to exercise its jurisdiction to review legality (judgment of 29 September 2011, Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C‑521/09 P, EU:C:2011:620, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited).\n\n44\n\n\nIt must be observed in this connection that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the plea alleging a failure to state reasons in the contested decision by stating that ‘the fact that the contested decision does not mention the role of the second and fourth Altmark conditions in the assessment of the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market is not attributable to an error of reasoning on the part of the Commission or to a failure to state reasons vitiating the contested decision, but rather to the fact that that decision applies a different analytical framework from that which favours [Viasat]’.\n\n45\n\n\nAs Viasat has conceded, the contested decision would only be vitiated by a failure to state reasons if the Commission had been required to apply the analytical framework which, according to Viasat, results from Article 106(2) TFEU.\n\n46\n\n\nHowever, it follows from paragraph 37 above that Article 106(2) TFEU did not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision. Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in holding that sufficient reasons were stated for the contested decision.\n\n47\n\n\nMoreover, as the Advocate General observed in point 58 of his Opinion, the complaint alleging a failure to respond to the pleas raised in the application at first instance is insufficiently developed for the other parties to the appeal to respond to or for the Court to rule on. Consequently, it is inadmissible.\n\n48\n\n\n Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected as in part inadmissible and in part unfounded.\n\n49\n\n\nIt follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.\n\nCosts\n\n50\n\n\nUnder Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which apply to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.\n\n51\n\n\nSince the Commission and TV2 A/S have applied for costs and Viasat has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay their costs.\n\n52\n\n\nPursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure, also applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those Rules, the Member States and institutions which intervene in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.\n\n53\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark, as an intervener before the General Court, is to bear its own costs.\n\n\n On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:\n\n\n1.\n\n\nDismisses the appeal;\n\n\n2.\n\n\nOrders Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd to pay the costs incurred by the European Commission and TV2/Danmark A/S; \n\n\n3.\n\n\nDeclares that the Kingdom of Denmark is to bear its own costs.\n\n\nSilva de Lapuerta\n\nRegan\n\nBonichot\n\nArabadjiev\n\nFernlund\n\nDelivered in open court in Luxembourg on 8 March 2017.\n\nA.
