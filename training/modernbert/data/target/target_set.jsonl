its appeal in Case C‑20/15 P, the European Commission asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939; ‘the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission’), whereby the General Court annulled Article 1(1) and Article 4 of Commission Decision 2011/5/EC of 28 October 2009 on the tax

EU:T:2014:938; ‘the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission’), whereby the General Court annulled Article 1(1) and Article 4 of Commission Decision 2011/282/EU of 12 January 2011 on the tax amortisation of financial goodwill for foreign shareholding acquisitions C 45/07 (ex NN 51/07, ex CP 9/07) implemented by Spain (OJ 2011 L 135, p. 1; ‘the second contested decision’).", "Background to the proceedings", "3", "The background to the proceedings, as set out in the judgments under appeal, may be summarised as follows.", "4", "On 10 October 2007, after a number of written questions had been sent to the Commission in 2005 and 2006 by Members of the European Parliament and after a private operator had submitted a complaint to it in 2007, the Commission decided to initiate the formal investigation procedure with respect to an arrangement laid down in a provision of Spanish corporate tax law introduced by Ley 24/2001, de Medidas Fiscales, Administrativas y del Orden Social (Law 24/2001 on fiscal, administrative and social measures) of 27 December 2001 (BOE No 313, of 31 December 2001, p. 50493), and reproduced in Real Decreto Legislativo 4/2004, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley del Impuesto sobre Sociedades (Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004 approving the recast text of the Corporate Tax Law; ‘TRLIS’) of 5 March 2004 (BOE No 61, of 11 March 2004, p. 10951), namely Article 12(5) TRLIS (‘the measure at issue’).", "5", "The measure at issue provides that, in the event that an undertaking taxable in Spain acquires a shareholding in a ‘foreign company’ equal to at least 5% of that company’s capital and retains that shareholding for an uninterrupted period of at least one year, the goodwill resulting from that shareholding, as recorded in the undertaking’s accounts as a separate intangible asset, may be deducted, in the form of an amortisation, from the basis of assessment for the corporation tax for which the undertaking is liable.", "The measure at issue states that, to be classified as a ‘foreign company’, a company must be liable to pay a tax that is identical to the tax applicable in Spain and its income must derive mainly from business activities carried out abroad.", "6", "In paragraphs 10 to 13 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission, which are identical to paragraphs 15 to 18 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court added the following:", "‘10", "It follows from the [first] contested decision that, under Spanish law, a business combination is an operation whereby one or more companies, on being dissolved without going into liquidation, transfer all their assets and liabilities to another existing company or to a company that they form in exchange for the issue to their shareholders of securities representing the capital of that other company (recital 23 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 32 of the second contested decision]).", "11", "In the [first] contested decision, share acquisition is to mean an operation whereby one company acquires a shareholding in the capital of another company without obtaining a majority or the control of the voting rights of the target company (recital 23 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 32 of the second contested decision]).", "12", "Furthermore, it is stated in the [first] contested decision that, according to the measure at issue, the financial goodwill is determined by deducting the market value of the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired company from the acquisition price paid for the shareholding.", "It is also stated that the concept of financial goodwill, as referred to in the measure at issue, introduces into the field of share acquisitions a concept that is usually used in transfers of assets or business combination transactions (recital 20 of the [first] contested decision [, identical to recital 29 of the second contested decision]).", "13", "Finally, it should be noted that under Spanish tax law, the acquisition by an undertaking which is taxable in Spain of a shareholding in a company established in Spain does not allow the goodwill resulting from that acquisition to be recorded separately for tax purposes.", "However, again according to Spanish tax law, goodwill can be amortised [only in the case of] a business combination (recital 19 of the [first] contested decision[, identical to recital 28 of the second contested decision]).’", "7", "By the first contested decision, the Commission concluded the procedure with respect to shareholding acquisitions within the European Union.", "8", "In Article 1(1) of that decision, the Commission declared incompatible with the common market the scheme introduced by the measure at issue (‘the scheme at issue’), whereby a tax advantage was granted to undertakings taxable in Spain in order to enable them to amortise the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shareholdings in foreign undertakings, where it was applied to acquisitions of shareholdings in undertakings established within the European Union.", "In Article 4 of that decision, the Commission ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid granted under that scheme.", "9", "The Commission maintained open, however, the procedure as regards acquisitions of shareholdings outside the European Union, the Spanish authorities having given an undertaking that they would provide further details concerning the obstacles to cross-border mergers outside the European Union.", "10", "By the second contested decision, the Commission declared incompatible with the common market the scheme at issue, whereby a tax advantage was granted to undertakings taxable in Spain in order to enable them to amortise the goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shareholdings in foreign undertakings, where it applied to acquisitions of shareholdings in undertakings established outside the European Union (Article 1(1) of that decision), and ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid granted under that scheme (Article 4 of that decision).", "The procedure before the General Court and the judgments under appeal", "11", "By an application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 May 2010, Autogrill España SA, now World Duty Free Group SA (‘WDFG’), brought an action seeking the annulment of Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the first contested decision.", "12", "In support of its action in so far as it is directed against Article 1(1) of that decision, WDFG relied on four pleas in law: (i) an error of law in the Commission’s application of the condition relating to selectivity; (ii) the measure at issue is not selective in so far as the differentiation that it introduces flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which it is part; (iii) the measure provides no advantage to companies to which the scheme at issue applies; and (iv) with respect to both the criterion relating to selectivity and that relating to the existence of an advantage, a failure to state adequate reasons for that decision.", "13", "By an application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 29 July 2011,  Banco Santander SA and Santusa Holding SL (‘Santusa’) brought an action seeking the annulment of Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the second contested decision.", "14", "In support of their action in so far as directed against Article 1(1) of that decision, Banco Santander and Santusa relied on five pleas in law: (i) an error of law in the Commission’s application of the condition relating to selectivity; (ii) an error in identifying the reference system; (iii) the measure at issue is not selective in so far as the differentiation that it introduces is a result of the nature or general structure of the system of which it is part; (iv) the measure provides no advantage to the companies to which the scheme at issue applies; and (v) with respect to both the criterion relating to selectivity and that relating to the existence of an advantage, a failure to state adequate reasons for the contested decision.", "15", "In the judgments under appeal, the General Court, on essentially identical grounds, upheld the first plea of law in each of the two actions, namely that Article 107(1) TFEU had been misapplied with respect to the condition relating to selectivity, and consequently annulled Article 1(1) and Article 4 of the contested decisions, without examining the other pleas raised in those actions.", "Form of order sought by the parties and procedures before the Court", "16", "The Commission claims that the Court should:", "—", "set aside the judgments under appeal;", "—", "refer the respective cases back to the General Court; and", "—", "reserve the costs.", "17", "WDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P, contend that the Court should dismiss the appeals, uphold the judgments under appeal and order the Commission to pay the costs.", "18", "By decisions of the President of the Court of 19 May 2015, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain were granted leave to intervene in support of the forms of order sought by WDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and by Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P.", "19", "On the other hand, by orders of the President of the Court of 6 October 2015, the applications of Telefónica SA and Iberdrola SA for leave to intervene in support of the forms of order sought by WDFG, in Case C‑20/15 P, and by Banco Santander and Santusa, in Case C‑21/15 P, were refused.", "The appeals", "20", "In support of its appeals, the Commission relies on a single ground of appeal, which has two parts, consisting of the claim that the General Court erred in law in the interpretation of the condition relating to selectivity as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU.", "The first part of the single ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "21", "By the first part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law by holding that the Commission was obliged, in order to demonstrate that a measure is selective, to identify a group of undertakings with specific characteristics.", "22", "The Commission maintains that, in the contested decisions, it rigorously followed the method for the analysis of selectivity in tax matters, as that method is set out in the Court’s settled case-law.", "The Commission accordingly established that the measure at issue constituted a derogation from a reference system, in that the effect of the measure was that the tax treatment of undertakings taxable in Spain acquiring shareholdings of at least 5% in companies established outside Spain differed from that applicable to undertakings taxable in Spain making identical acquisitions in companies established in Spain, although those two categories of undertakings were in comparable situations in the light of the objective pursued by the general Spanish system for the taxation of companies.", "23", "The Commission considers that the General Court, by imposing on it the additional obligation of demonstrating that the measure at issue favours certain undertakings capable of identification by reason of characteristics specific to them that other undertakings do not possess, in other words ex ante identifiable features that are characteristic of them, erred in law, since, in so doing, the General Court attributed a meaning to the condition relating to selectivity that is more restrictive than that defined by the Court.", "24", "The Commission maintains, in particular, that, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraphs 57 and 58 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 61 and 62 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, measures can be classified as selective even if those measures are to be applied regardless of the nature of the activities of the beneficiary and create a tax advantage for certain investment transactions without setting a minimum investment amount.", "25", "According to the Commission, in that context, the General Court erred in inferring from the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that a national measure which is to be applied regardless of the nature of the activity of undertakings is not, a priori, selective.", "The statement in paragraph 36 of that judgment, that ‘national measures such as those at issue in the main proceedings do not constitute State aid … if they apply to all undertakings in national territory, regardless of their activity’ should be understood to mean that the reason why there is no selectivity is that the national measure applies indiscriminately to all undertakings in the Member State concerned.", "26", "The Commission also claims that the General Court erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 59 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 63 to 66 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that a measure such as the measure at issue is not selective where it is linked to the purchase of particular financial assets, namely shareholdings in foreign companies, and where no category of undertakings is, a priori, excluded from benefiting from it.", "27", "The Commission submits that the General Court wrongly relied in this regard on the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467).", "It follows from paragraphs 22 and 23 of that judgment that, in the case which gave rise to it, the Commission had classified the measure concerned as selective only in relation to certain geographically defined undertakings in which private investors had reinvested the profits from the sale of economic assets and not in relation to those investors themselves, for whom it had held that that measure did not constitute aid.", "28", "In addition, the Commission criticises the General Court for having held, in paragraphs 66 to 68 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 70 to 72 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that it would be contrary to the case-law of the Court of Justice to regard as selective a national tax measure the benefit of which is subject to certain conditions, even though the beneficiary undertakings do not share any feature characteristic of them that distinguishes them from other undertakings, apart from the fact that they are capable of satisfying the conditions governing the application of the measure.", "29", "The Commission submits that the General Court relies in that regard on an erroneous analysis of the case-law concerned.", "30", "With respect to the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), the Commission argues that it is clear from paragraphs 90 and 91 of that judgment that that case concerned a particular situation in which the Court considered the reference tax system itself to be selective, in that it favoured ‘offshore’ undertakings as such, rather than any derogation from it.", "The reference made in that judgment to the ‘specific properties’ of a category of undertakings should therefore be understood as referring to the characteristics by reason of which those undertakings were favoured for tax purposes under a reference system that was inherently selective and cannot be extrapolated beyond that particular context.", "31", "As regards paragraph 42 of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), the General Court failed to take into account the second sentence of that paragraph, which sets out the principle, enshrined in the Court’s settled case-law, that a measure is selective if it is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings, who are, in the light of the objective pursued by the scheme, in a comparable factual and legal situation.", "32", "WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa submit, first, that the Commission did not maintain, in the contested decisions, that the measure at issue was de facto selective, and, consequently, the present appeals are concerned only with examining the criticisms directed against the judgments under appeal to the effect that the General Court held that the grounds relied on by the Commission in those decisions did not support the conclusion that that measure was de jure selective.", "33", "They contend that it follows from the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that a measure from which all undertakings can benefit cannot be considered to be selective.", "That judgment does not however permit the inference, as claimed by the Commission, that a national measure is not selective where it applies to all the undertakings in a Member State without exception, since, if that argument were valid, almost all tax rules would have to be considered to be selective.", "34", "WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa also dispute the Commission’s argument that national tax measures have on many occasions previously been classified as selective even though they set no minimum investment amount and applied regardless of the nature of the beneficiary’s activities.", "In any event, the measure at issue, in that it confers a tax advantage on any undertaking that wishes to benefit from it, irrespective of which category it falls into, for that reason alone cannot be deemed to be prima facie and de jure selective.", "35", "The General Court was correct to rely on the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), since, in the decision that was at issue in that judgment, the Commission had expressly accepted that the national measure was not selective as regards the investors concerned, a position confirmed by the Court.", "36", "In its decision-making practice, moreover, the Commission has on many occasions previously found tax measures not to be selective on the basis of the same criterion, in other words that general measures which are applicable to all undertakings without distinction and of which all taxable persons may take advantage are not selective.", "37", "What is more, the application of that criterion would not lead to a finding that measures relating to the purchase of certain assets as referred to by the Commission were not selective.", "Such measures could be classified as selective if it were shown that they do in fact benefit certain undertakings to the exclusion of others.", "In any event, their selectivity would follow not from the nature of the assets acquired but from the fact that it is legitimate to hold that the purchasers concerned form a particular category.", "38", "With regard to the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa take the view that the General Court was right to consider that the measure at issue in the case which gave rise to that judgment differs from that in the present case, since it was intended to confer an advantage on a distinct and identifiable category of undertakings, that is to say those engaged in exporting.", "39", "WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa further submit that it follows clearly from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), and in particular paragraph 104 thereof, that a measure can be classified as selective only if it benefits a category of undertakings sharing ‘properties’ which are ‘specific’ to them.", "It follows moreover from that judgment that the identification of a derogation from an ordinary system is not an end in itself.", "All that matters is the actual effect of the measure, namely the fact that it does or does not benefit specific undertakings or the production of specific goods.", "40", "WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa argue that the interpretation of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), advocated by the Commission, can again not be accepted.", "First, in that judgment, the Court did not uphold the definition of a reference system and a derogation from that system.", "Second, that judgment does not permit a conclusion that a measure is selective by reason of the fact that the undertakings which satisfy the conditions to benefit from that measure form a distinct category.", "41", "Last, the General Court was correct to hold that a measure cannot be classified as selective, within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU, if the benefit of that measure depends on conduct that is prima facie open to any undertaking, irrespective of an undertaking’s sector of activity.", "That follows from the finding, in the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), that a national measure was not selective as regards investors.", "42", "The Kingdom of Spain submits that the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598) confirms the position taken by the Spanish authorities during the administrative procedure before the Commission, to the effect that an economic advantage can be classified as aid only if it is capable of favouring ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "43", "In the course of that administrative procedure, the Spanish authorities demonstrated that the measure at issue was generally accessible, on the ground that it was applied to undertakings active in very different business sectors, thereby supporting the analysis set out in the judgments under appeal and the fact that the Commission had failed in the contested decisions to demonstrate that that measure was selective.", "44", "Ireland submits that, contrary to what is argued by the Commission, the General Court did not infer from the judgment of the Court of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), and the judgments of the General Court of 6 March 2002, Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission (T‑92/00 and T‑103/00, EU:T:2002:61), and of 9 September 2009, Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission (T‑227/01 to T‑229/01, T‑265/01, T‑266/01 and T‑270/01, EU:T:2009:315), that only measures the application of which was linked to the nature of the undertaking’s activities or the application of which was dependent on a minimum amount were selective, but held that selectivity could not be established with respect to a measure from which all undertakings resident for tax purposes in Spain and making acquisitions of at least 5% shareholdings in foreign undertakings could benefit, regardless of the nature of their activities and the amounts invested.", "45", "The General Court was correct to rely on the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), in order to hold that it was necessary, if different tax treatment was to be classified as aid, that a particular category of undertakings capable of benefiting should be identified, by reason of their specific properties.", "The condition relating to selectivity as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU should moreover be defined in the same way in all cases concerning alleged State aid of a fiscal nature.", "Accordingly, the principle expressly stated in paragraph 104 of that judgment cannot be limited to a situation in which a tax system taken as a whole is selective.", "46", "Ireland considers that measures such as the measure at issue, which do not a priori exclude any undertaking or any particular economic sector from the ambit of its recipients, cannot be regarded as being selective.", "The Commission has on several occasions previously relied on that ground in order to determine that certain national measures are not selective.", "47", "The Federal Republic of Germany submits that the existence, even if it were established, of a derogation from or exception to the reference framework identified by the Commission is not, in itself, sufficient to conclude that the measure at issue favours ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "48", "On the contrary, it follows only that that measure is similar to a subsidy.", "Consequently, after an examination designed to determine that the measure has the nature of a derogation, it is appropriate, in accordance with the case-law and, in particular, the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), and as the General Court correctly held in the judgments under appeal, thereafter to determine whether the category of taxpayers favoured by a tax measure involves sufficiently specific undertakings or the production of sufficiently specific goods within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "49", "It follows accordingly from the Court’s case-law that the category of undertakings which receive a tax advantage is sufficiently specified where the Commission has been able to demonstrate that the advantage concerned was for the benefit of only undertakings belonging to a single economic sector and carrying out particular transactions (judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774), only undertakings that have a particular legal form (judgment of 10 January 2006, Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others, C‑222/04, EU:C:2006:8), only undertakings of a certain size (judgment of 13 February 2003, Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92) or only undertakings resident for tax purposes outside the territory of a region (judgment of 17 November 2009Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri, C‑169/08, EU:C:2009:709).", "50", "The Federal Republic of Germany recalls that the Court has previously held that a tax concession in favour of taxpayers who sell certain financial assets and can offset the resulting profit when they acquire other financial assets confers on them an advantage which, as a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators, cannot be classified as State aid (judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission, C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467, paragraph 22).", "51", "A fortiori, therefore, a tax measure such as that at issue, the application of which is generally linked to a certain category of transactions falling within the scope of company law, in this instance the acquisition of shareholdings, regardless of the object and business activities of the undertaking, should not be considered to be selective.", "52", "Last, the Member States intervening in these cases submit that, if the selectivity of a national measure as a condition for its classification as State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, were to be understood in the broad sense advocated by the Commission in its appeals, the consequence would be an undermining of the division of powers within the European Union.", "If such scope were to be conferred on the selectivity condition, the Commission could review almost all direct tax measures by virtue of its powers in the field of State aid, although direct taxation falls, as a general rule, within the legislative competence of the Member States.", "Findings of the Court", "53", "First, it must be recalled that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, classification of a national measure as ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, requires all the following conditions to be fulfilled.", "First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources.", "Second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between the Member States.", "Third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient.", "Fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, inter alia, judgment of 16 July 2015, BVVG, C‑39/14, EU:C:2015:470, paragraph 24).", "54", "So far as concerns the condition relating to the selectivity of the advantage, which is a constituent factor in the concept of ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, it is clear from equally settled case-law of the Court that  the assessment of that condition requires a determination whether, under a particular legal regime, a national measure is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation and who accordingly suffer different treatment that can, in essence, be classified as discriminatory  (see, inter alia, judgments of 28 July 2011, Mediaset v Commission, C‑403/10 P, not published, EU:C:2011:533, paragraph 36; of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 75 and 101; and of 14 January 2015, Eventech, C‑518/13, EU:C:2015:9, paragraphs 53 to 55; and of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C‑15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 59).", "55", "Further, where the measure at issue is conceived as an aid scheme and not as individual aid, it is for the Commission to establish that that measure, although it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or certain sectors of activity (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraphs 49 and 50).", "56", "As regards, in particular,  national measures that confer a tax advantage, it must be recalled that a measure of that nature which, although not involving the transfer of State resources, places the recipients in a more favourable position than other taxpayers is capable of procuring a selective advantage for the recipients and, consequently, of constituting State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.On the other hand, a tax advantage resulting from a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators does not constitute such aid  (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 18 July 2013, P,C‑6/12, EU:C:2013:525, paragraph 18).", "57", "In that context, in order to classify a national tax measure as ‘selective’, the Commission must begin by identifying the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, and thereafter demonstrate that the tax measure at issue is a derogation from that ordinary system, in so far as it differentiates between operators who, in the light of the objective pursued by that ordinary tax system, are in a comparable factual and legal situation (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraph 49).", "58", "The concept of ‘State aid’ does not, however, cover measures that differentiate between undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by the legal regime concerned, are in a comparable factual and legal situation, and are, therefore, a priori selective, where the Member State concerned is able to demonstrate that that differentiation is justified since it flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which the measures form part (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgments of 29 April 2004, Netherlands v Commission, C‑159/01, EU:C:2004:246, paragraphs 42 and 43; of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraphs 64 and 65; and of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 40).", "59", "Further, it must be recalled that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for the application of a measure can benefit from the measure cannot, in itself, make it into a selective measure (judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 42).", "60", "It follows from all the foregoing that  the appropriate criterion for establishing the selectivity of the measure at issue consists in determining whether that measure introduces, between operators that are, in the light of the objective pursued by the general tax system concerned, in a comparable factual and legal situation, a distinction that is not justified by the nature and general structure of that system  (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C‑15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 61). 61", "Those are the factors that must guide the Court’s examination of whether, in this case, the General Court misconstrued Article 107(1) TFEU, as interpreted by the Court, by holding that the Commission had not, in the contested decisions, demonstrated to the requisite legal standard that the measure at issue conferred a selective advantage on ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’.", "62", "In this case, the measure at issue confers a tax advantage that consists in a deduction from the taxable base for corporation tax in the form of an amortisation of the goodwill resulting from the acquisition by undertakings resident for tax purposes in Spain of at least 5% shareholdings in undertakings resident for tax purposes outside that Member State.", "That measure must, since it is capable of conferring an advantage on all such undertakings which carry out such transactions, be regarded as capable of constituting an aid scheme.", "It was therefore for the Commission to establish that that measure, notwithstanding that it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or on certain sectors of activity.", "63", "In that regard, the General Court stated, in paragraph 50 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 54 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Commission, in order to establish that the measure at issue was selective, had primarily relied, in the contested decisions, on the ground that that measure constitutes a derogation from a reference system, in that the effect of that measure was the application to undertakings taxable in Spain, acquiring shareholdings in companies established outside Spain, of a tax treatment that differed from that applied to undertakings taxable in Spain making such acquisitions in companies established in Spain, although those two categories of undertakings were in comparable situations in the light of the objective pursued by that reference system, namely the general Spanish system for the taxation of companies and, more specifically, the rules relating to the tax treatment of financial goodwill within that tax system.", "64", "The General Court held, in paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Commission had thereby applied the analytical method that may be deduced from the case-law of the Court and of the General Court cited, respectively, in paragraphs 29 to 33 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 33 to 37 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, which essentially corresponds to the Court’s case-law cited in paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment.", "65", "However, in paragraphs 44, 45, 52 and 53 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 48, 49, 56 and 57 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court held that the existence, were it to be established, of a derogation or an exception to the reference system identified by the Commission was not sufficient, in itself, to establish that the measure at issue favoured ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, since that measure was accessible, a priori, to any undertaking and it was directed not to a particular category of undertakings, which would have been the only undertakings favoured by that measure, but to a category of economic transactions.", "66", "It is, however, clear that that reasoning is based on a misapplication of the selectivity condition laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU, as described in this judgment.", "67", "As is apparent from paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment,  with respect to a national measure conferring a tax advantage of general application, such as the measure at issue, that condition is satisfied where the Commission is able to demonstrate that that measure is a derogation from the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, thereby introducing, through its actual effects, differences in the treatment of operators, although the operators who qualify for the tax advantage and those who do not are, in the light of the objective pursued by that Member State’s tax system, in a comparable factual and legal situation.", "68", "It is apparent from the judgments under appeal that the Commission relied, in the contested decisions, in order to establish that the measure at issue was selective, on the fact that the consequence of that measure was that resident undertakings were not treated equally.", "Pursuant to that measure, only resident undertakings who acquired at least 5% shareholdings in foreign companies could, under certain conditions, qualify for the tax advantage at issue, whereas resident undertakings making the acquisition of such a shareholding in undertakings taxable in Spain could not obtain that advantage, notwithstanding the fact that, according to the Commission, they were in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary Spanish tax system.", "69", "However, the General Court considered that the measure at issue, on the grounds that it did not affect any particular category of undertakings or the production of any particular category of goods, that it was applicable regardless of the nature of an undertaking’s activity and that it was accessible, a priori or potentially, to all undertakings that wanted to acquire shareholdings of at least 5% in foreign companies and that held those shareholdings without interruption for at least one year, had to be regarded not as a selective measure but as a general measure within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 56 of this judgment.", "In so doing, the General Court erred in law.", "70", "Thus, in paragraphs 41, 45, 67 and 68 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 45, 49, 71 and 72 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the General Court held that, if the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure relevant to the recognition of State aid, in respect of a measure that is a priori accessible to any undertaking, is to be satisfied, it is always necessary that a particular category of undertakings, who are exclusively favoured by the measure concerned and who can be distinguished by reason of specific properties, common to them and characteristic of them, be identified.", "71", "However, the imposition of such a supplementary requirement to identify a particular category of undertakings, additional to the analytical method applicable to selectivity in tax matters that may be deduced from the Court’s settled case-law, which essentially involves ascertaining whether the exclusion of certain operators from the benefit of a tax advantage that arises from a measure derogating from an ordinary tax system constitutes discrimination with respect to those operators, cannot be inferred from the Court’s case-law and, in particular, from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732).", "72", "It is true that, in paragraph 104 of that judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), the Court held that, in order to be capable of being recognised as conferring selective advantages, the criteria forming the basis of assessment which are adopted by a tax system must be such as to characterise the recipient undertakings, by virtue of properties which are specific to them, as a privileged category, thus permitting such a regime to be described as favouring ‘certain’ undertakings or the production of ‘certain’ goods, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "73", "However, that ground of the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), must be read in the context of the set of grounds of which it forms part, set out in paragraphs 87 to 108 of that judgment.", "74", "It follows from a reading of all those grounds that the measure at issue in that judgment did not take the form of a tax advantage that derogated from an ordinary tax system, but rather involved the application of a ‘general’ tax scheme based on criteria that were, in themselves, also general.", "The Court held that the nature of that scheme did not preclude a finding that the measure concerned was selective, contrary to the ruling of the General Court, since the condition relating to selectivity has a broader scope that extends to measures which, by their effects, favour certain undertakings, in that case ‘offshore’ companies, on account of the specific features characteristic of those undertakings.", "That measure accordingly operated de facto discrimination against undertakings that were in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, in that case the objective of putting in place generalised taxation of all resident companies.", "75", "By contrast, as stated above in paragraph 63 of this judgment, in the contested decisions, the Commission, in order to establish the selectivity of the measure at issue, relied primarily on the ground that the consequence of that measure is discrimination, in that it confers a tax advantage on certain resident undertakings and not on others who are subject to the same ordinary tax system from which the measure at issue is a derogation.", "76", "While it therefore follows from the judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), that the selectivity of a tax measure can be established even if that measure does not constitute a derogation from an ordinary tax system, but is an integral part of that system, the fact remains that that judgment is consistent with the Court’s settled case-law, cited in paragraph 57 of this judgment, to the effect that it is sufficient, in order to establish the selectivity of a measure that derogates from an ordinary tax system, to demonstrate that that measure benefits certain operators and not others, although all those operators are in an objectively comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary tax system.", "77", "Indeed, while it is not always necessary that a tax measure, in order for it to be established that it is selective, should derogate from an ordinary tax system, the fact that it can be so characterised is highly relevant in that regard where the effect of that measure is that two categories of operators are distinguished and are subject, a priori, to different treatment, namely those who fall within the scope of the derogating measure and those who continue to fall within the scope of the ordinary tax system, although those two categories are in a comparable situation in the light of the objective pursued by that system. 78", "Contrary to what was held by the General Court in the judgments under appeal,  neither can it be required of the Commission, in order to establish the selectivity of such a measure, that it should identify certain specific features that are characteristic of and common to the undertakings that are the recipients of the tax advantage, by which they can be distinguished from those undertakings that are excluded from the advantage.", "79", "All that matters in that regard is the fact that the measure, irrespective of its form or the legislative means used, should have the effect of placing the recipient undertakings in a position that is more favourable than that of other undertakings, although all those undertakings are in a comparable factual and legal situation in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned. 80", "Further, according to the Court’s settled case-law, the fact that the number of undertakings able to claim entitlement under a national measure is very large, or that those undertakings belong to various economic sectors, is not sufficient to call into question the selective nature of that measure and, therefore, to rule out its classification as State aid (see, inter alia, judgments of 13 February 2003, Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92, paragraph 48, and of 8 September 2011, Commission v Netherlands, C‑279/08 P, EU:C:2011:551, paragraph 50).", "81", "Accordingly, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraphs 53 to 58 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 57 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, the potentially selective nature of the measure at issue is in no way called into question by the fact that the essential condition for obtaining the tax advantage conferred by that measure is that there should be an economic transaction, more particularly an ‘entirely financial’ transaction, for which no minimum investment is required and which is available regardless of the nature of the business of the recipient undertakings.", "82", "In that context, contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraph 57 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 61 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, it cannot be inferred from paragraph 36 of the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), according to which measures are not selective where they apply to all the undertakings in the national territory, ‘regardless of their activity’, that a measure whose application does not depend on the nature of the undertakings’ activity is, a priori, not selective.", "83", "It is apparent from reading all the grounds of that judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer  Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), that, in paragraph 36, read in the light of paragraph 35 of that judgment, the Court held that national measures, such as those at issue in that case, were not selective where they applied indiscriminately to all undertakings in the Member State concerned and constituted, for that reason, a general measure within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 56 of the present judgment.", "84", "It must also be made clear that while the Court, in paragraph 36 of the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), referred to the activity of undertakings benefiting from the national measures, that reference is explained by the wording of the second question submitted by the referring court in the case that gave rise to that judgment.", "That is confirmed by the fact that no such reference is made in the subsequent judgments of the Court which restate that principle (see, inter alia, judgments of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 73, and of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 39).", "85", "Moreover, it is true, as stated by the General Court in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the Court held, in paragraph 42 of the judgment of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184), that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for application of the measure concerned in that case could benefit from that measure could not, in itself, make it a selective measure.", "However, it must be noted that, in that same paragraph, the Court expressly stated that the absence of selectivity was due to the finding that persons who were not eligible for the measure concerned were not in a factual and legal situation comparable to that of taxpayers who were eligible, in the light of the objective pursued by the national legislature.", "86", "It follows that a condition for the application or the receipt of tax aid may be grounds for a finding that that aid is selective, if that condition leads to a distinction being made between undertakings despite the fact that they are, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, in a comparable factual and legal situation, and if, therefore, it represents discrimination against undertakings which are excluded from it.", "87", "Further, while, as stated by the General Court in the judgments under appeal,  the tax advantage conferred by the measure at issue can be obtained without any minimum investment requirement and without, consequently, the benefit of that measure being reserved to undertakings having sufficient financial resources, those factors do not preclude the possibility of that measure being classified as selective for other reasons, such as the fact that resident undertakings making acquisitions of shareholdings in companies resident for tax purposes in Spain could not obtain that advantage.", "88", "In that regard, it may be added that the Court has previously ruled that a tax measure from which solely undertakings that carried out specified transactions benefited, and not undertakings in the same sector that did not carry out those transactions, could be classified as selective, there being no need to assess whether that measure was of greater benefit to large undertakings (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774, paragraphs 47 to 50).", "89", "Contrary to the General Court’s assertion in paragraphs 59 to 62 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 63 to 66 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, no indication to the contrary as regards the analysis of the condition relating to the selectivity of a tax measure may be deduced from the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467).", "90", "It follows from paragraphs 22 and 23 of the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467), that, in the case that gave rise to that judgment, the Commission had classified the measure concerned as selective in relation to certain geographically defined undertakings in which private investors had reinvested the profits derived from sales of financial assets and not in relation to those investors themselves, with respect to whom the Commission had considered that that measure did not constitute aid, since, as a general measure, it benefited all operators indiscriminately, an assessment that was, moreover, not challenged before the Court and on which the Court therefore did not have to give a ruling.", "91", "In any event, the situation of those private investors cannot be treated as equivalent to that of the resident undertakings that can benefit from the measure at issue.", "92", "In the contested decisions,  the Commission, in order to classify the measure at issue as a selective measure, relied on the fact that the tax advantage conferred by that measure did not indiscriminately benefit all economic operators who were objectively in a comparable situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the ordinary Spanish tax system, since resident undertakings acquiring shareholdings of the same kind in companies resident for tax purposes in Spain could not obtain that advantage.", "The Commission then considered that the justification of that distinction between operators, relied on by the Kingdom of Spain, based on the nature or general structure of the system of which that measure formed part, could not be accepted. 93", "It follows from all the foregoing that the General Court erred in law, in annulling the contested decisions, in part, on the ground that the Commission had failed to define a particular category of undertakings favoured by the tax measure at issue, while omitting to determine whether the Commission, in applying the method of examination, described in paragraphs 29 to 33 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 33 to 37 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, which must be used in order to examine the condition relating to the selectivity of the measure at issue, had in fact analysed the question and had established that that measure was discriminatory.", "94", "While, indeed, that examination must be carried out rigorously and while sufficient reasons must be stated to permit full judicial review, in particular of the question whether the situation of operators benefiting from the measure is comparable with that of operators excluded from it and, where appropriate, of the justification for discrimination relied on by the Member State concerned, the fact remains that the General Court erred in law by not undertaking such a review, and by ruling, in the judgments under appeal, that the examination method applied by the Commission in the contested decisions, in failing to define a particular category of undertakings which were exclusively favoured by the tax measure at issue, was based on a misinterpretation of the condition relating to selectivity as laid down by Article 107(1) TFEU.", "95", "Consequently, the first part of the Commission’s single ground of appeal is well founded.", "The second part of the single ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "96", "By the second part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law in applying the case-law relating to aid for exports and introduced an artificial distinction between aid for exports of goods and aid for exports of capital.", "97", "As regards, first, the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law, in holding in paragraphs 69 to 76 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 73 to 80 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that that case-law concerns not the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure, but only the condition relating to the effect on competition and trade.", "98", "According to the Commission, it is apparent from the judgments cited in the preceding paragraph that the Court considered that the tax measures concerned were selective, on the ground that the benefit of them was reserved to undertakings that carried out transactions abroad, such as investments, and not to undertakings carrying out similar transactions domestically.", "The Commission maintains that it follows that any measure that is to the benefit of cross-border transactions, but excludes the same domestic transactions, is selective.", "99", "Second, the Commission claims that General Court was wrong to introduce, in paragraphs 79 to 81 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 83 to 85 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, an artificial distinction between aid for exports and aid for export of capital in holding that it followed from the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), that ‘the category of recipient undertakings allowing a finding that the measure at issue was selective was made up of [exporting] undertakings’, a category bringing together undertakings which could be distinguished by reason of their common characteristics linked to their export activity.", "100", "According to the Commission, the undertakings affected by the measure at issue constitute a distinct category of undertakings, namely that of undertakings that export capital, since they share specific common characteristics linked to their activity of exporting capital.", "101", "The Commission considers that, since, with respect to the condition relating to selectivity, there is no difference between the export of goods and the export of capital, the measure at issue was selective to the same degree as the measures concerned in the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions.", "102", "The Commission maintains that a category of exporting undertakings does not exist, as something separate from the group of undertakings that carry out cross-border transactions.", "Any undertaking within a Member State can carry out a cross-border transaction and, thereby, qualify for an export aid scheme.", "The Commission considers that a national measure may become selective because of the advantage granted to the beneficiary of the measure, as a result of carrying out an export transaction, of goods, services or capital, and not by reason of the fact that the undertakings concerned are members of an alleged export sector.", "103", "Accordingly, as the Court ruled in the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), in a situation comparable to that in this case, the General Court ought to have held that the Commission had properly established the selectivity of the measure at issue by reason of the fact that the benefit of that measure was reserved to certain undertakings, namely those which were engaged in the activity of exporting capital.", "104", "Last, the approach adopted the General Court ignores the role and purpose of the body of State aid rules in relation to the protection of the internal market.", "That body of rules is intended in particular to ensure that Member States do not grant economic advantages specifically linked to the export of goods or capital.", "The act of specifically favouring exports of capital could give rise to distortions in the internal market in the same way as the act of specifically favouring exports of goods.", "105", "WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa contend that the General Court was correct to hold that the judgments of the Court relied on in the contested decisions concerned not the condition relating to selectivity, but the conditions relating to the effect on trade.", "106", "Further, the General Court was correct to hold that, in the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Court considered that the measures concerned were selective, the principal ground being that the recipient undertakings shared certain characteristics, a factor that allowed the conclusion that those undertakings belonged to a particular sector of the economy, namely the export sector, more specifically the goods exporting sector.", "The measures at issue in the cases that gave rise those judgments favoured undertakings of which it was a characteristic feature that they exported a more or less significant part of their goods or services.", "107", "WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa argue that the measure at issue cannot, moreover, be considered to be selective on the ground that it applies to the category of undertakings described as ‘exporters of capital’.", "108", "Such a category does not exist, and the Commission referred to it neither in the contested decisions nor before the General Court.", "That argument is inadmissible in an appeal, since it concerns a question of fact that is moreover raised out of time.", "It may be added that the argument contradicts the Commission’s main line of argument, that the Commission was not obliged to identify a category of undertakings that were affected by a measure in order to establish the selectivity of that measure.", "109", "In any event, WDFG and Banco Santander and Santusa contend that the selectivity of a national measure cannot be ascertained on the basis of characteristics such as the capital of an undertaking or its capacity to invest, since such characteristics are inherent in any undertaking.", "110", "In addition, the rules governing the free movement of capital do not preclude a measure such as the measure at issue.", "While that measure involved different treatment that favours acquisitions of shareholdings abroad, that is at most reverse discrimination which is compatible with the fundamental freedoms.", "111", "The Kingdom of Spain restates its position, previously argued in the administrative procedure before the Commission, that there is no economic activity that consists of exporting capital.", "The measure at issue does not favour certain undertakings or the production of certain goods since it is not concerned with the supply of goods and services on the market.", "112", "Ireland maintains that the judgments relied on by the Commission in the contested decisions concerned measures which favoured a readily identifiable category of undertakings or the production of a readily identifiable category of goods, namely those involved in the export sector.", "However, there is no coherent category of undertakings that ‘export capital’, since any undertaking that makes an acquisition abroad ‘exports capital’.", "113", "The Federal Republic of Germany argues that the Commission’s submission in the alternative that the measure at issue is comparable to a measure granting aid for the export of goods and is therefore also aimed at the sufficiently delimited category of exporting undertakings has to be regarded as a retrospective addition of grounds to the contested decisions.", "The Federal Republic of Germany considers that that argument must be declared to be inadmissible on appeal.", "114", "The Federal Republic of Germany contends that the category of exporting undertakings at issue in the case-law relied on by the Commission in the contested decisions is distinct from other undertakings because of common characteristics linked to their exporting activity, which, in some cases, was connected to the making of specific investments.", "Findings of the Court", "115", "As regards the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions, in particular the judgments of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), and of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), it is clear that, as stated, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 126 to 130 of his Opinion, the General Court erred in law, in holding, in paragraphs 69 to 76 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 73 to 80 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that that case-law did not concern the condition relating to the selectivity of a national measure, but only the condition relating to the question whether competition and trade were affected.", "116", "In paragraph 20 of the judgment of 10 December 1969, Commission v France (6/69 and 11/69, not published, EU:C:1969:68), and in paragraph 8 of the judgment of 7 June 1988, Greece v Commission (57/86, EU:C:1988:284), the Court, in finding that there was State aid, necessarily held that all the conditions laid down on that subject in Article 107(1) TFEU, including the condition relating to selectivity, were satisfied.", "Further, in paragraph 120 of the judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission (C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438), the Court, referring, inter alia, to the two abovementioned judgments, expressly stated its position on the selectivity of the national measure under examination, holding that, in that case, selectivity followed from the fact that only undertakings engaged in export activities and carrying out certain investment transactions abroad qualified for the tax advantage conferred by that measure.", "117", "The General Court also erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 77 to 82 of the judgment under appeal Autogrill España v Commission and in paragraphs 81 to 86 of the judgment under appeal Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, that the case-law relating to aid for exports relied on in the contested decisions had to be understood as meaning that the category of recipient undertakings with respect to whom the selectivity of export aid schemes must be examined was that constituted by ‘export undertakings’, which had to be defined as a category, which, while admittedly extremely broad, is nevertheless defined, comprising undertakings that could be distinguished by reason of specific, shared characteristics linked to their exporting activity.", "118", "As observed, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 133 to 136 of his Opinion, that case-law cannot be understood as meaning that a national measure must necessarily be classified as selective where that measure benefits exclusively undertakings that export goods or services, even if, in fact, that may have been the case with respect to the particular tax measures at issue in the judgments concerned.", "119", "On the contrary, taking into consideration the principles enshrined in the Court’s settled case-law, as set out above in paragraphs 53 to 60 of this judgment, which are entirely applicable to tax aid for exports, a measure such as the measure at issue, designed to facilitate exports, may be regarded as selective if it benefits undertakings carrying out cross-border transactions, in particular investment transactions, and is to the disadvantage of other undertakings which, while in a comparable factual and legal situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, carry out other transactions of the same kind within the national territory.", "120", "That being the case, the second part of the single ground of appeal is also well founded.", "121", "Consequently, since both parts of the Commission’s single ground of appeal are well founded, the judgments under appeal must be set aside.", "The actions before the General Court", "122", "In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, if the Court quashes the decision of the General Court, it may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits.", "123", "That is not the case here, since the General Court upheld the two actions for annulment but did not examine three of the four pleas in law relied on in each of those actions, pleas which only partly overlap, and did not examine, within its examination of the first pleas in law in those actions, whether those undertakings that did not meet the conditions for obtaining the tax advantage conferred by the measure at issue were, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, in a factual and legal situation comparable to that of the undertakings favoured by that measure.", "Further, examination of those pleas may involve assessment of matters of fact.", "The cases must therefore be referred back to the General Court.", "Costs", "124", "Since the cases are being referred back to the General Court, it is appropriate to reserve the costs.", "125", "Pursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain, as interveners, must bear their own costs.", "On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby:", "1.", "Sets aside the judgments of the General Court of the European Union of 7 November

its appeal, Nya Destination Stockholm Hotell Teaterpaket AB (‘NDSHT’) seeks to have set aside the judgment of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities (now ‘the General Court’) of 9 June 2009 in Case T-152/06 NDSHT v Commission [2009] ECR II‑1517 (‘the judgment under appeal’) declaring inadmissible NDSHT’s action for annulment of the decision contained in the letters of the Commission of the European Communities of 24 March and 28 April 2006 addressed to NDSHT, relating to a complaint concerning allegedly unlawful State aid granted by the City of Stockholm to Stockholm Visitors Board AB (‘the act in question’).", "Legal context", "2 As is apparent from recital 2 in its preamble, Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [88 EC] (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1), as amended by the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the European Union is founded (OJ 2003 L 236, p. 33) (‘Regulation No 659/1999’), codifies and reinforces the practice for examining State aid established by the Commission in accordance with the case-law of the Court.", "3 Under Article 1(b)(i) of that regulation, ‘existing aid’ means ‘without prejudice to Articles 144 and 172 of the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and to Annex IV, point 3 and the Appendix to said Annex of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, all aid which existed prior to the entry into force of the [EC] Treaty in the respective Member States, that is to say, aid schemes and individual aid which were put into effect before, and are still applicable after, the entry into force of the Treaty’.", "4 In accordance with Article 1(h) of that regulation, the term ‘interested party’ is defined as ‘any Member State and any person, undertaking or association of undertakings whose interests might be affected by the granting of aid, in particular the beneficiary of the aid, competing undertakings and trade associations’.", "5 Article 4(1) to (4) of Regulation No 659/1999, in Chapter II thereof, which is entitled ‘Procedure regarding notified aid’, provides:", "‘1.", "The Commission shall examine the notification as soon as it is received.", "Without prejudice to Article 8, the Commission shall take a decision pursuant to paragraphs 2, 3 or 4.", "2.", "Where the Commission, after a preliminary examination, finds that the notified measure does not constitute aid, it shall record that finding by way of a decision.", "3.", "Where the Commission, after a preliminary examination, finds that no doubts are raised as to the compatibility with the common market of a notified measure, in so far as it falls within the scope of Article [87(1) EC], it shall decide that the measure is compatible with the common market (hereinafter referred to as a “decision not to raise objections”).", "The decision shall specify which exception under the Treaty has been applied.", "4.", "Where the Commission, after a preliminary examination, finds that doubts are raised as to the compatibility with the common market of a notified measure, it shall decide to initiate proceedings pursuant to Article [88(2) EC] (hereinafter referred to as a “decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure”).’", "6 Chapter III of that regulation governs the procedure regarding unlawful aid.", "In that chapter, Article 10(1) provides:", "‘Where the Commission has in its possession information from whatever source regarding alleged unlawful aid, it shall examine that information without delay.’", "7 In Chapter III, Article 13, entitled ‘Decisions of the Commission’, provides in paragraph 1 thereof:", "‘The examination of possible unlawful aid shall result in a decision pursuant to Article 4(2), (3) or (4). …’", "8 In Chapter VI of Regulation No

Commission takes a decision on a case concerning the subject matter of the information supplied, it shall send a copy of that decision to the interested party.", "3.", "At its request, any interested party shall obtain a copy of any decision pursuant to Articles 4 and 7, Article 10(3) and Article 11.’", "9 Article 25 of Regulation No 659/1999 provides:", "‘Decisions taken pursuant to Chapters II, III, IV, V and VII shall be addressed to the Member State concerned. …’", "II – Factual background to the dispute", "10 NDSHT is a company incorporated under the laws of Sweden which carries on the activities of a tour operator in Stockholm through its website.", "It offers a packaged service including hotel reservations and a tourist card called ‘Stockholm à la carte’, which gives holders access to a number of services and facilities in Stockholm, such as museums and local transport.", "11 Stockholm Visitors Board AB (‘SVB’) is a company owned by the City of Stockholm through various subsidiaries.", "It is responsible for providing tourist information and promoting the Stockholm region.", "In connection with that type of activity, it also pursues commercial activities consisting, in particular, in the reservation of discounted hotel rooms in Stockholm and the sale of a package of tourist-related services, by means of a card called ‘the Stockholm Card’, offering free admission to places of interest and facilities in Stockholm.", "12 In September 2004, NDSHT sent the Commission information regarding the annual grants made by the City of Stockholm to SVB for the years 2003 to 2005, alleging that those grants constituted State aid granted in infringement of Article 88(3) EC.", "NDSHT asserted in its complaint that that alleged State aid consisted in yearly appropriations from the City of Stockholm’s budget in favour of SVB, the reimbursement of SVB’s pre-tax losses by its parent company on a regular basis, and preferential access to public facilities, such as metered parking managed by that city.", "According to NDSHT, SVB could use that aid to finance its commercial activities that are, however, in competition with those of other national and international undertakings, thereby distorting competition.", "13 The Commission investigated NDSHT’s complaint in the light of supplementary information provided by the latter and by the Swedish authorities in response to requests for information sent to them by the Commission.", "14 On 24 March 2006, the Director of ‘State Aid 1: Cohesion and Competitiveness’, the service in the Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition responsible for the file (‘the Director of the Commission service responsible for the file’), sent the following letter to NDSHT:", "‘…", "I would like to inform you that, on the basis of the available information, the competent services of the Directorate-General for Competition have reached the conclusion that there are not sufficient reasons for continuing the investigation of your complaint. …", "According to our analysis, the Stockholm Card and the hotel bookings are (with the exception of the inclusion of parking spaces in the Stockholm Card) carried out on market conditions.", "These activities are thus not financed from State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty.", "As regards the use of certain parking spaces for free, arguably there is no affectation on trade, or even if there is, such aid has been included in the Stockholm Card since well before Sweden joined the European Union in 1995 and would thus constitute existing aid.", "Moreover, this service is since 1 January 2006 no longer included in the Stockholm Card.", "With respect to other activities (the provision of tourism information, etc.), it appears as if these are covered by the rules on Services of General Economic Interests (SGEI).", "Cross-subsidisation in favour of economic activities does not seem to occur.", "In case the compensation for the SGEIs would be classified as State aid, such aid would nevertheless have been provided under the same conditions since well before 1995 and would thus constitute existing aid.", "In summary, the extensive investigations we have undertaken on this complaint suggest that we are in the presence of existing aid, and not illegal aid, which is in any case compatible with the common market.", "Since there are no grounds to institute the appropriate measures procedure provided for in Article 88(1) of the Treaty, we do not propose to take any further action on this matter.", "…’", "15 By letter of 5 April 2006, NDSHT informed the Commission that it understood the letter of 24 March 2006 as meaning that its complaint had been rejected and a decision adopted pursuant to Articles 13 and 4(2) and (3) of Regulation No 659/1999 not to raise any objections with regard to the financial measures in question.", "NDSHT also asked the Commission to send it a copy of that decision, in accordance with Article 20 of that regulation.", "16 By letter of 28 April 2006, the Director of the Commission service responsible for the file replied to NDSHT stating that the information received did not indicate that the measures complained of constituted unlawful State aid and consequently no decision by the Commission under Article 20 of Regulation No 659/1999 could be addressed to it.", "The proceedings before the General Court and the judgment under appeal", "17 By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 6 June 2006, NDSHT sought the annulment of the act in question and the initiation of the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC.", "18 By separate document, the Commission raised an objection of inadmissibility pursuant to Article 114(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, to which NDSHT responded on 9 November 2006.", "19 NDSHT claimed in its observations relating to the objection of inadmissibility that the act in question expressed both a final refusal on the part of the Commission to initiate the formal investigation procedure provided for in Article 88(2) EC and a decision to close the case.", "The act in question should therefore be regarded as a decision affecting NDSHT’s legal situation.", "It thus constituted an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC.", "20 By the judgment under appeal, the General Court dismissed NDSHT’s action as inadmissible and ordered it to pay the costs .", "21 The General Court held that, in order to determine whether the act in question constituted an act open to challenge, it was necessary to establish, in the light of its substance, whether it constituted a decision under Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999 or merely an informal communication pursuant to the second sentence of Article 20(2) of that regulation.", "22 It stated, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was not obliged to adopt a decision within the meaning of Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999 in response to every complaint.", "Such an obligation arose only where Article 13 of the regulation was applicable.", "That was not the case where the complaint concerned existing aid.", "In paragraph 64 of the judgment, the General Court considered that an obligation to adopt a decision within the meaning of Article 4 of that regulation following a complaint concerning existing aid would run counter to the general scheme of the State aid review procedure.", "23 It is apparent from the substance of the letters of 24 March and 28 April 2006 (together ‘the contested letters’) that the Commission had decided not to pursue the complaint on the ground that the aid in question constituted existing aid covered by the procedure in Article 88(1) EC.", "The General Court considered, in paragraph 57 of the judgment under appeal, that, in that case, in the light of settled case-law, the Commission could not be compelled, by means of a complaint, to issue a recommendation proposing appropriate measures to the Member States pursuant to Article 18 of Regulation No 659/1999.", "Furthermore, none of the provisions thereof applicable to existing aid contemplated the possibility of the Commission’s adopting a measure amounting to a decision at the end of the preliminary examination of that aid.", "24 Finally, in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court stated that, since the Commission considered, at the end of its initial examination of the financial measures in question, that they should be regarded as existing aid, the contested letters could not constitute a refusal to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC.", "25 The General Court consequently concluded that the contested letters had to be regarded not as a decision for the purposes of Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999, but as an informal communication for the purposes of Article 20 thereof.", "Therefore, they did not constitute an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC.", "Forms of order sought before the Court", "26 By its appeal, while disputing the classification of the measures in question by the Commission, NDSHT asks the Court to set aside the judgment under appeal in its entirety then, principally, to grant its application at first instance and order the Commission to pay the costs or, in the alternative, to declare its action admissible, refer the case back to the General Court and reserve the decision on costs relating to the two proceedings.", "27 The Commission contends that the appeal should be dismissed and NDSHT ordered to pay the costs.", "The appeal", "28 NDSHT raises four grounds in support of its appeal.", "29 The first ground of appeal alleges manifest distortion of the contents of the contested letters.", "By its second ground of appeal, the appellant submits that the General Court erred in law in considering the act in question to be a preparatory act not constituting a definitive decision open to challenge in an action for annulment.", "According to its third ground of appeal, NDSHT complains that the General Court erred in law in considering that the position adopted by the Commission should be treated as a rejection of a request for appropriate measures to be taken within the meaning of Article 88(1) EC.", "Finally, by its fourth ground of appeal, NDSHT claims that the General Court also erred in law in holding that the classification, by the Commission, of the financial measures in question as existing aid prevented the rejection of the complaint from being challenged.", "Such a solution was based on a misinterpretation of Articles 4, 10, 13 and 20 of Regulation No 659/1999.", "30 Since the second to fourth grounds of appeal are closely linked, it is appropriate to examine them together.", "The second to fourth grounds of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "31 Referring, in particular, to Case C‑521/06 P Athinaïki Techniki v Commission [2008] ECR I‑5829, NDSHT alleges that the General Court misconstrued Articles 4, 10, 13 and 20(2) of Regulation No 659/1999 by holding that the rejection of its complaint by the Commission did not have the characteristics of a decision which produced binding legal effects such as to affect its interests and, therefore, of an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC.", "32 The appellant considers, in its second ground of appeal, that the General Court erred in law in stating that the act in question constituted not a definitive decision, but a preparatory act.", "It submits that the Commission had, on the contrary, completed its examination and adopted a decision, without however having formalised it, the object of which was to reject the complaint on the ground that the financial aid granted was compatible with the common market.", "33 In that regard, the appellant considers, in its third ground of appeal, that, in paragraph 57 et seq. of the judgment under appeal, the General Court erred in law by classifying the position taken by the Commission as a rejection of a request for appropriate measures to be taken within the meaning of Article 88(1) EC and not as a refusal to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC.", "Likewise, the General Court wrongly asserted that the Commission could not be obliged by a complainant to take a decision at the end of the preliminary examination stage.", "34 Furthermore, the appellant claims, in its fourth ground of appeal, that Articles 4, 10 and 13 of Regulation No 659/1999 oblige the Commission, where it examines a complaint concerning the existence of allegedly unlawful aid, to conclude the preliminary examination stage by adopting a decision, as is stated in Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 40.", "35 That obligation to take a decision also applies where the preliminary examination stage leads the Commission to believe that there is existing aid.", "The possibility of contesting a Commission letter refusing to initiate the formal investigation procedure on the ground that the contested aid was existing aid was confirmed by the Court in Case C‑313/90 CIRFS and Others v Commission [1993] ECR I‑1125.", "Therefore, according to the appellant, the General Court’s interpretation, in paragraph 64 et seq. of the judgment under appeal, that it would run counter to the general scheme of the State aid review procedure to hold that the Commission necessarily adopts a decision under Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999 where it informs a complainant that its complaint concerns existing aid is evidence of a profoundly mistaken view of that procedural system.", "That interpretation would mean that, by classifying the contested financial measures as existing aid, the Commission could avoid any review by the European Union judicature, which would be clearly unacceptable.", "36 The Commission acknowledges, first of all, that the contested letters do not deal with all of the financial measures in question and that it did not, by those letters, take a decision concerning existing aid.", "On the contrary, those letters contain a number of hypothetical, and accordingly not definitive, conclusions not leading moreover to an identical classification of those different measures.", "In those letters, the Commission, at the most, summarised the position of the service responsible for dealing with the complaint, according to which it did not at that time intend to pursue it.", "37 Next, the argument put forward by NDSHT that the Commission adopted a decision although without formalising it is inadmissible, since it was not put forward during the proceedings at first instance.", "38 In any event, the Commission contends that it did not adopt a decision and restricted itself to a provisional assessment, the file on the complaint having been closed only in December 2006.", "Furthermore, as regards existing aid, it could not adopt a decision immediately but had, if it considered the measures to be incompatible with the common market, first to inform the Member State concerned before possibly proposing appropriate measures.", "Since Regulation No 659/1999 does not provide for any specific procedure to be followed in such a case, the only possible means of challenging the act in question would have been an action for failure to act.", "39 Finally, the Commission contests the relevance of the references to CIRFS and Others v Commission and Athinaïki Techniki v Commission since, when it has found that there is existing aid, the Commission is no longer in a position to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC.", "Findings of the Court", "– Admissibility of the argument invoked by NDSHT relating to the fact that the Commission’s decision was not formalised", "40 According to the Commission, the argument put forward by the appellant that it concluded its examination of the financial measures in question with a decision that was not formalised was not raised before the General Court and is accordingly inadmissible.", "41 In that regard, it must be observed that it follows from Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, in conjunction with Article 113(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that, on appeal, an appellant may put forward any relevant argument, provided only that the subject-matter of the proceedings before the General Court is not changed in the appeal (Case C‑229/05 P PKK and KNK v Council [2007] ECR I‑439, paragraph 66, and Case C‑8/06 P Herrero Romeu v Commission [2007] ECR I‑10333, paragraph 32).", "42 However, it is clear that, contrary to the Commission’s contention, that argument was indeed included in the application lodged by NDSHT before the General Court, in which it is claimed, in paragraph 29, that ‘it is settled case-law that the form in which acts or decisions are cast has no bearing on the right to challenge them’.", "Therefore, even assuming that that argument was not expressed in the appeal in the same terms as in that application, it does not change the subject-matter of the proceedings before the General Court.", "43 It follows that that argument is admissible.", "– Substance", "44 The appellant seeks in essence to show, in its second to fourth grounds of appeal, that the General Court erred in law in holding that the contested letters did not have the characteristics of an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC.", "45 In that regard, the Court has repeatedly held that an action for annulment for the purposes of Article 230 EC must be available against all acts adopted by the institutions, whatever their nature or form, which are intended to have legal effects capable of affecting the interests of the applicant by bringing about a distinct change in his legal position (see, inter alia, Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 29 and case-law cited, and Case C‑362/08 P Internationaler Hilfsfonds v Commission [2010] ECR I‑0000, paragraph 51).", "46 It follows also from settled case-law concerning the admissibility of actions for annulment that it is necessary to look to the actual substance of the acts challenged in order to classify them (see, in particular, Case 60/81 IBM v Commission [1981] ECR 2639, paragraph 9, and Case C‑147/96 Netherlands v Commission [2000] ECR I‑4723, paragraph 27).", "47 By contrast, the form in which an act or decision is adopted is in principle irrelevant to the right to challenge such acts or decisions by way of an action for annulment.", "It is therefore, in principle, irrelevant for the classification of the act in question whether or not it satisfies certain formal requirements, namely in particular, that it is duly identified by its author and that it mentions the provisions providing the legal basis for it.", "It is therefore irrelevant that the act may not be described as a ‘decision’ or that it does not refer to Article 4(2), (3) or (4) of Regulation No 659/1999.", "It is also of no importance that the Member State concerned was not notified of the act at issue by the Commission, infringing Article 25 of that regulation, as such an error is not capable of altering the substance of that act (see Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraphs 43 and 44 and case-law cited).", "48 Furthermore, it is in principle those measures which definitively determine the position of the Commission upon the conclusion of an administrative procedure, and which are intended to have legal effects capable of affecting the interests of the complainant, that constitute acts open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC, and not intermediate measures whose purpose is to prepare for the final decision, which do not have those effects (see Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 42 and case-law cited).", "49 With regard to the possible definitive and actionable nature of measures taken by the Commission in the procedure for reviewing State aid, it should be noted, first, that the Commission must, under Article 10(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, carry out an examination where it has in its possession information from whatever source regarding allegedly unlawful aid.", "The examination of a complaint, on the basis of that provision, gives rise to the initiation of the preliminary examination stage under Article 88(3) EC and obliges the Commission to examine, immediately, the possible existence of aid and its compatibility with the common market (see, to that effect, Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 37).", "50 Article 13(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, which is applicable in the context of an examination of a complaint alleging unlawful aid, obliges the Commission to close that preliminary examination stage by adopting a decision pursuant to Article 4(2), (3) or (4) of that regulation, that is to say, a decision finding that aid does not exist, raising no objections or initiating the formal investigation procedure, since that institution is not authorised to persist in its failure to act during the preliminary examination stage.", "Once that stage of the procedure has been completed the Commission is bound, consequently, either to initiate the next stage of the procedure, provided for by Article 88(2) EC, or to adopt a definitive decision rejecting the complaint (see, to that effect, Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 40 and case-law cited).", "51 Where the Commission finds, following examination of a complaint, that the investigation has revealed no grounds for concluding that there is State aid within the meaning of Article 87 EC, it refuses by implication to initiate the procedure provided for by Article 88(2) EC (see, to that effect, Case C‑367/95 P Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France [1998] ECR I‑1719, paragraph 47).", "52 As regards the Commission’s finding that the measures complained of constituted existing aid, it should be noted that existing aid is of course subject to the constant review provided for in Article 88(1) EC and must be regarded as lawful so long as the Commission has not found that it is incompatible with the common market (see Case C‑44/93 Namur-Les assurances du crédit [1994] ECR I‑3829, paragraph 34, and Case C‑400/99 Italy v Commission [2001] ECR I‑7303, paragraph 48).", "However, where it receives a complaint relating to allegedly unlawful aid, the Commission, in classifying the measure as existing aid, subjects it to the procedure provided for by Article 88(1) EC and thus refuses by implication to initiate the procedure provided for by Article 88(2) EC (see, to that effect, CIRFS and Others v Commission, paragraphs 25 and 26, and Case C‑321/99 P ARAP and Others v Commission [2002] ECR I‑4287, paragraph 61).", "53 Such a decision refusing to initiate the procedure provided for by Article 88(2) EC is definitive and cannot be characterised as a mere provisional measure (CIRFS and Others v Commission, paragraph 26, and, to that effect, Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraphs 54 and 58).", "54 In such a situation, the persons intended to benefit from the procedural guarantees afforded by that provision may secure compliance therewith only if they are able to challenge the decision in question before the European Union judicature under the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC.", "That principle applies equally, whether the ground on which the decision is taken is that the Commission regards the aid as compatible with the common market or that, in its view, the very existence of aid must be discounted (Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France, paragraph 47) or where it considers that there is existing aid (see, to that effect, CIRFS and Others v Commission, paragraph 27, and ARAP and Others v Commission, paragraph 62).", "55 That finding is corroborated by Article 20 of Regulation No 659/1999, which governs the rights of interested parties.", "According to the second and third sentences of Article 20(2) thereof, after obtaining from such an interested party information concerning alleged unlawful aid or alleged misuse of aid, the Commission will either consider that there are insufficient grounds for taking a view on the case and inform the interested party thereof or take a decision on a case concerning the subject-matter of the information supplied.", "It follows that, where the Commission has examined such information and taken a position on it, it takes a decision.", "56 Therefore, an action for annulment of a decision not to initiate the procedure pursuant to Article 88(2) EC brought by a party concerned within the meaning of that article, must be considered to be admissible where that party seeks thereby to safeguard the procedural rights available to him under that latter provision (see Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 36 and case-law cited).", "57 In the present case, it is common ground that the Commission examined the appellant’s complaint in the light of additional information supplied by the latter and the Swedish authorities in response to requests for information sent to them by the Commission.", "On the conclusion of the examination of the complaint, the Commission stated, in its letter of 24 March 2006, that there were not sufficient reasons for continuing the investigation and added that it did not propose to take any further action on the matter.", "Furthermore, by its letter of 28 April 2006, it stated that the financial measures in question did not constitute unlawful aid.", "58 Since the Commission concluded that there were not sufficient reasons for continuing the investigation of the complaint, it follows from the substance of the act in question that that institution formed a definitive opinion on the measures examined, thus expressing its wish to terminate its preliminary examination.", "With that finding, as follows from the case-law cited in paragraph 52 of this judgment, it refused by implication to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC.", "59 The appellant, as an undertaking in competition with the company benefiting from the measures complained of, is without doubt an interested party for the purposes of Article 88(2) EC (see Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France, paragraph 41, and Case C‑319/07 P 3F v Commission [2009] ECR I‑5963, paragraph 32), having regard to the definition of that term in Article 1(h) of Regulation No 659/1999.", "60 It must therefore be held that the General Court erred in law in holding that the act in question did not have the characteristics of a decision producing binding legal effects such as to affect the appellant’s interests and, in particular, that it did not constitute a decision pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999.", "It follows that the act in question must be regarded as an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC.", "61 It follows from the foregoing considerations that the second to fourth grounds raised by NDSHT in support of its appeal must be upheld.", "62 Moreover, as the Court has pointed out in paragraphs 52 and 60 of this judgment that a decision such as the act in question constituted an act open to challenge even though the Commission found that the measures complained of constituted existing aid, it is no longer necessary to examine the first ground of appeal put forward by the appellant alleging distortion of the contents of the contested letters.", "63 In those circumstances, the judgment under appeal must be set aside.", "Referral of the case back to the General Court", "64 In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, if the Court quashes a decision of the General Court, it may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits, or refer the case back to the General Court for judgment.", "65 However, the Court is not in a position to adjudicate on the substance of the action brought by NDSHT.", "That aspect of the action, and in particular the question whether the Commission was wrong to decide not to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC, on the ground that the measures at issue constituted existing aid in any case compatible with the common market, involves carrying out assessments of fact on the basis of information which was not evaluated by the General Court or debated before the Court.", "Conversely, the Court does have the information necessary to rule definitively on the objections of inadmissibility raised by the Commission during the proceedings at first instance.", "66 For the reasons given in paragraphs 44 to 62 of this judgment, that objection of inadmissibility, alleging that the act in question is not open to challenge in an action for annulment, must be dismissed.", "67 The case must therefore be referred back to the General Court for judgment on NDSHT’s claim for annulment of the Commission’s decision, contained in the contested letters, not to continue its investigation of the complaint lodged by the appellant concerning allegedly unlawful State aid granted by the City of Stockholm to SVB.", "Costs", "68 Since the case is being referred back to the General Court, it is

appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos AE Metalleion kai Viomichanias Chrysou (‘Ellinikos Chrysos’) asks the Court to set aside the judgment of the General Court of 9 December 2015, Greece and Ellinikos Chrysos v Commission (T‑233/11 and T‑262/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:948), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed its action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/452/EU of 23 February 2011 on the State aid C 48/08 (ex NN 61/08) implemented by Greece in favour of Ellinikos Chrysos AE (OJ 2011 L 193, p. 27, ‘the decision at issue’).", "Background to the dispute and the decision at issue", "2", "Until 2003 TVX Hellas AE operated the Cassandra (Greece) gold mines.", "Under an extrajudicial settlement of 12 December 2003, the Hellenic Republic acquired the ownership of the assets of TVX Hellas for EUR 11 million and, released it, together with TVS Hellas’ parent company TVX Gold Inc., from any administrative or criminal liability or any obligation for possible infringements of environmental protection legislation.", "3", "Article 51 of Law No 3220/2004 ratified that settlement, whereas Article 52 of that law ratified the contract whereby the Hellenic Republic transferred the assets of TVX Hellas to Ellinikos Chrysos for the sum of EUR 11 million.", "Those assets consist of gold mines, land and gold stocks.", "In addition, the acquirer undertook, first, to carry out the actions and procedures for environmental protection and maintenance within the time limit provided for granting the necessary authorisations and approvals, and, second, to commence the measures necessary for the start of the operation of the Cassandra mines within a period of three months.", "Third, the acquirer undertook to complete an investment project on the development of those mines and on the construction and operation of the gold processing plant, within a period of 24 months.", "4", "In addition, Article 5 of that contract stipulated that the transaction transferring assets to Ellinikos Chrysos was exempt from duties and taxes.", "5", "After having received a complaint in connection with that transaction, the European Commission sent requests for additional information from the Greek authorities.", "By decision of 10 December 2008, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU.", "In that context, Ellinikos Chrysos submitted observations.", "6", "By the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in essence, that the transaction transferring TVX Hellas’ assets to Ellinikos Chrysos by the Hellenic Republic constituted aid incompatible with the internal market and that that Member State had to recover it.", "By that decision, the Commission took the view, first, that the Cassandra mines had been sold to Ellinikos Chrysos at a price below market value and, second, that the exemption from registration duties or other taxes relating to the transaction transferring the disputed land constituted an additional element of the aid at issue.", "The total amount of the aid was set at EUR 15.34 million.", "The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal", "7", "In support of its action for annulment of the decision at issue, Ellinikos Chrysos put forward two pleas in law, the first of which was subdivided into several heads of claim.", "8", "Under the second head of claim of the first plea in law, which the General Court summarised in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos claimed that the Commission had incorrectly used and assessed the expert report on the appraisal of the Cassandra mines carried out in 2004 by an international consulting firm specialised in the mining sector on behalf of European Goldfields Ltd, as part of its plans to increase its capital in Ellinikos Chrysos (‘the expert report’), on which the Commission had relied to assess the value of those mines.", "The General Court referred to the arguments relating to the context in which that report had been drawn up, the date it was drawn up and the definition of the operational mines referred to in it, all of which, it was argued, rendered it unsuitable for an assessment of the value of those mines.", "Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that it was common ground that Ellinikos Chrysos did not dispute the reliability and objectivity of that report.", "9", "After having rejected the argument concerning the date when the expert report had been drawn up, the General Court found that that report stated that a mine that was operating or was subject to a feasibility study was at the ‘near-production’ stage, which was the case, still according to that report, of the Stratoni, Olympiada and Skouries mines, which are included in the Cassandra operation.", "10", "Therefore, in paragraph 99 ofthe judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the second head of claim of the first plea of law.", "11", "In addition, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the expert report used the so-called ‘income approach’ to assess the value of the mines at issue; the relevance of that approach was not called into question by Ellinikos Chrysos.", "12", "As regards the value of the Skouries mine, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to the expert report, a feasibility study had been completed, so that that value had been determined using the income approach, taking into account the costs of development, construction and functioning as well as administrative costs for obtaining an operating permit.", "13", "As regards the value of the land at the mines at issue, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 126 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had considered that they represented assets transferred to Ellinikos Chrysos, whose intrinsic value had been assessed by the expert report on the basis of the information provided by Ellinikos Chrysos.", "The General Court confirmed that value in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal and dismissed the action as a whole.", "Forms of order sought by the parties", "14", "Ellinikos Chrysos requests the Court to:", "—", "set aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court; and", "—", "order the Commission to pay the costs.", "15", "The Commission contends that the Court should:", "—", "dismiss the appeal; and", "—", "order Ellinikos Chrysos to the pay the costs.", "The appeal", "Preliminary considerations", "16", "In support of its appeal, the appellant raises three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal concerning the assessment of the value of the mines transferred, defective reasoning in that judgment concerning the assessment of the value of the land transferred, and the incorrect valuation of the advantage arising from the tax exemption on the transfer transaction.", "17", "In essence, the appellant disputes, by its three grounds of appeal, the General Court’s assessment of the amount of the advantage which was granted to it as a result of the transfer of the mines and land in Cassandra.", "18", "In that regard, first, it is settled case-law that the Commission must make complex economic assessments when assessing the value of aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 68).", "19", "In those circumstances, the review by the EU judicature of such a process is necessarily restricted.", "It is limited to determining whether the rules governing procedure and the requirement for a statement of reasons have been complied with, whether the facts are accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or any misuse of powers (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 28).", "20", "In particular, it is not for the EU judicature, in the context of that review, to substitute its own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C-223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 78).", "21", "Second, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only.", "The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.", "The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 January 2017, Masco and Others v Commission, C‑614/13 P, EU:C:2017:63, paragraph 35).", "22", "Consequently, the present appeal can succeed only if Ellinikos Chrysos shows that the General Court erred in law or distorted the facts or evidence in the exercise of its restricted review of the Commission’s assessment of the amount of the aid in dispute.", "The first ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "23", "By its first ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its sale.", "It states that it is apparent from the decision at issue that the activities were suspended in all of the Cassandra mines.", "As regards the Skouries mine, the General Court could not confirm that it had a positive value and at the same time find that that mine was merely a deposit without infrastructure or mining permits.", "24", "In the second place, the General Court failed to respond to the appellant’s argument disputing the use of the expert report for the purpose of assessing the value of the mines transferred because of the context in which it had been created.", "In addition, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of incorrect information contained in that report with regard to the effective resumption of the activities of the Stratoni and Olympiada mines.", "The result was an incorrect assessment of the advantage derived by Ellinikos Chrysos from the purchase of the Cassandra mines.", "25", "In the third place, the General Court did not take into account, in order to confirm the assessment of that advantage, certain costs related to infrastructure which had to be met in order to render the Skouries mine operational.", "26", "The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "27", "As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study.", "Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.", "28", "In that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal.", "In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.", "29", "Similarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted.", "Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.", "30", "As regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.", "31", "In that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).", "32", "In addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).", "33", "It is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines.", "Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.", "34", "In those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.", "35", "Secondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it.", "Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.", "36", "As regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production.", "Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.", "37", "In any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.", "38", "Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up.", "That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder.", "The second ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "39", "By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in the first place, that the General Court relied on an insufficient and contradictory statement of reasons in order to reject, in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, its arguments relating to the assessment of the value of land of the Cassandra mines.", "If the General Court had found that the mines to which that land was attached were not in operation at the time of the transfer of the assets, its assessment of the value of that land would have been less than that which results from the judgment under appeal.", "40", "In the second place, the General Court confirmed the evaluation method for the value of the land based on the price paid by TVX Hellas in 1995.", "At that time, however, the mines were in operation and the value of the land was necessarily higher than in 2003.", "41", "Primarily, the Commission maintains that the second ground of appeal, as a whole, is inadmissible.", "In the alternative, it contends that the appellant’s arguments are manifestly unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "42", "As regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines.", "That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found.", "In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment.", "Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.", "43", "As regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.", "44", "Moreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue.", "Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.", "45", "In any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment.", "It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.", "46", "Since Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed.", "47", "Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.", "The third ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "48", "By its third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, since the value of the land at issue was not properly estimated by the Commission, the amount of the advantage accruing from the tax exemption which it has been granted is necessarily incorrect, the amount of those taxes being directly related to the value of that land.", "49", "The Commission proposes that that ground of appeal be dismissed as being unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "50", "The third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations.", "As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case.", "The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.", "51", "It follows from all of those considerations that the judgment under appeal must be set aside inasmuch as, by that judgment, the General Court failed to respond to Ellinikos Chrysos’ argument based on the purpose for which the expert’s report was drawn up.", "For the remainder, the appeal is dismissed.", "The action before the General Court", "52", "In accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the General Court is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.", "53", "Since that is the case here, it is necessary to examine the argument in the second head of claim of the first plea in law of the action at first instance brought by Ellinikos Chrysos, which is based on the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up.", "54", "In that regard, the appellant claims that the purpose for which the expert report was drawn up rendered it unsuitable for use in assessing the value of the Cassandra mines.", "Thus, since that report had been commissioned in order to advise the Board of Directors of European Goldfields on the potential acquisition of additional shares in the capital of Ellinikos Chrysos, it covered the value of that company over the long term.", "55", "However, and in so far as the appellant does not call into question either the reliability or the objectivity of the expert report, a mere reference to the context in which it was drawn up cannot have the effect of depriving it of any credibility for the evaluation of the Cassandra mines.", "56", "Indeed, and in the absence of anything to suggest the contrary put forward by Ellinikos Chrysos, it does not appear that the purpose for which an expert report is created has any bearing on the value of the estimated assets, unless to challenge the reliability and objectivity of that expert report.", "57", "In so far as that is not the case here, that argument and the action for annulment brought by Ellinikos Chrysos before the General Court must be dismissed as a whole.", "Costs", "58", "Under Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs.", "Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "59", "Since the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against Ellinikos Chrysos and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be

[(Law No 335 amending the Law on Broadcasting Services) of 4 June 1986].", "TV2 A/S is, as was its predecessor TV2, the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio (“DR”).", "3.", "TV2 A/S, like, previously, TV2, has a public-service mission to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes.", "These may be broadcast by means of radio equipment, in particular, satellite or cable systems.", "Rules governing the public-service obligations of TV2 A/S and TV2 are laid down by the Danish Minister for Culture.", "4.", "Apart from the public broadcasters, commercial television broadcasters operate on the nationwide television broadcasting market in Denmark.", "These include, first, [Viasat] and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (“SBS”).", "5.", "TV2 was set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of DR, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers.", "The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike DR, TV2 would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.", "6.", "Following a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting AS/TvDanmark, another commercial broadcaster on the Danish market, the system for funding TV2 was examined by the Commission of the European Communities in its Decision 2004/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for [TV2] (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 1; “the TV2 I decision”).", "That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: licensing fees, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2 (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2 at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees for nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, “the measures concerned”).", "Lastly, the Commission’s investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2 to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2’s public-service programmes through those installations.", "7.", "After examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (now Article 107(1) TFEU).", "That conclusion was based on the finding that TV2’s funding system, which sought to compensate it for the cost of providing its public services, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [(C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415) (“the Altmark conditions”)].", "8.", "In addition, the Commission decided that the aid granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2, in the form of licence fees and the other measures described in the TV2 I decision, was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (now Article 106(2) TFEU), with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish Kroner (DKK) which it classified as overcompensation (recital 163 to and Article 1 of the TV2 I decision).", "It accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2 A/S (Article 2 of the TV2 I decision), which had in the meantime replaced TV2 (see paragraph 2 above).", "9.", "Given that the recovery of aid referred to in Article 2 of the TV2 I decision rendered TV2 A/S insolvent, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission, by letter of 23 July 2004, of a planned recapitalisation of that company.", "That plan provided, so far as State-funded measures were concerned, for a capital injection of DKK 440 million, on the one hand, and the conversion into capital of a State loan of DKK 394 million, on the other.", "By its Decision C(2004) 3632 final of 6 October 2004, in State Aid Case No N 313/2004 relating to the recapitalisation of [TV2 A/S] (OJ 2005 C 172, p. 3; “the recapitalisation decision”), the Commission concluded that the two measures planned for TV2 A/S were “necessary to rebuild the capital which TV2 [A/S] need[ed], following its conversion into a limited company, to fulfil its public-service mission” (recital 53 of the recapitalisation decision).", "Consequently, the Commission decided that any element of State aid that might be connected with the planned recapitalisation of TV2 A/S was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (recital 55 to the recapitalisation decision).", "10.", "The TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2 A/S (Case T‑309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T‑317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2 A/S, namely [Viasat] (Case T‑329/04) and SBS (Case T‑336/04).", "11.", "By judgment of 22 October 2008in TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission [(T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457)], the Court annulled the TV2 I decision. [In paragraph 124 of that judgment], the Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that TV2’s public-service mission was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest ...", "It also found, however, several instances of illegality vitiating the TV2 I decision, which led, in short, to the annulment of that decision.", "12.", "Thus, first, examining the question whether the measures concerned by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons for which it took advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, as State resources [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 160 to 167)].", "Second, the Court found that the Commission’s examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the legal and economic considerations which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2.", "The TV2 I decision was, in consequence, vitiated by failure to state reasons on that point [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 224 to 233)].", "Third, the Court held that the Commission’s conclusions on the examination of the compatibility of the aid in the light of Article 86(2) EC, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons.", "According to the Court, that inadequacy of the reasons stated was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the actual legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2 during the period under investigation [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 192, 197 to 203).", "13.", "The recapitalisation decision was the subject of two actions for annulment, brought by SBS and by [Viasat].", "By two orders delivered on 24 September 2009, the Court ruled that, in the light of the annulment of the TV2 I decision and the close link between the obligation to recover the aid resulting from that decision and the measures which are the subject of the recapitalisation decision, it was no longer necessary to rule on those cases [(orders of 24 September 2009, SBS TV and SBS Danish Television v Commission, T‑12/05, not published, EU:T:2009:357, and [of 24 September 2009,] Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, T‑16/05, not published, EU:T:2009:358)].", "14.", "Following the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned.", "On that occasion, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S and, furthermore, received observations from the third parties.", "15.", "The Commission presented the result of its re-examination of the measures concerned in the contested decision, which is the subject of the present action and of another action brought by TV2 A/S [(TV2/Danmark v Commission, T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684)], in which the Court has delivered its judgment today.", "16.", "The contested decision concerns the measures granted to TV2 between 1995 and 2002.", "However, in its analysis the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.", "17.", "In the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU in favour of TV2 (recital 153 of the contested decision).", "First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources (recital 90 to the contested decision) and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, it concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions (recital 153 to the contested decision).", "However, whereas in the TV2 I decision it had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million was overcompensation incompatible with Article 86(2) EC, in the contested decision the Commission took the view that that sum was a capital buffer appropriate for TV2 A/S (recital 233 to the contested decision).", "In the operative part of the contested decision, it therefore declared as follows:", "“Article 1", "The measures implemented by Denmark in favour of [TV2] between 1995 and 2002 in the form of the licence fee resources and other measures discussed in this Decision are compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 106(2) [TFEU].”’", "The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal", "3", "By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 14 March 2012, Viasat sought annulment in part of the contested decision.", "4", "Viasat claimed that the State aid granted to TV2 was incompatible with the internal market, raising two pleas in this connection.", "The first plea alleged an error of law committed by the Commission which, in assessing the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU, did not take into account the second and fourth Altmark conditions.", "The second plea alleged a failure by the Commission to fulfil its duty to state reasons in so far as that institution, without explaining the reasons for its decision, found that Article 106(2) TFEU applied in the present case, although the second and fourth Altmark conditions were not met.", "5", "By the judgment under appeal, the General Court declared that it was unnecessary to adjudicate on the action, in so far as that action sought the annulment of the contested decision in that the Commission had found that the advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2 by the TV2 Fund amounted to State aid, and dismissed the action as to the remainder .", "6", "By its judgment of 24 September 2015, TV2/Danmark v Commission (T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684), the General Court, in an action brought by TV2, annulled the contested decision in so far as it had characterised as State Aid the advertising revenue received by TV2 for the years 1995 and 1996.", "The forms of order sought", "7", "Viasat claims that the Court should:", "—", "primarily, set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed its action and annul the contested decision, and order the Commission to pay the costs of the proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice; and", "—", "in the alternative, set aside judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the General Court for a decision and reserve the decision on costs.", "8", "The Commission contends that the Court should:", "—", "dismiss the appeal; and", "—", "order Viasat to pay the costs incurred at both instances.", "9", "The Kingdom of Denmark contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal.", "10", "TV2 A/S contends that the Court should:", "—", "primarily, dismiss the appeal;", "—", "in the alternative, maintain the effects of the judgment under appeal and of the contested decision; and", "—", "order Viasat to pay the costs of TV2 A/S.", "The request to reopen the oral procedure", "11", "Following the delivery of the Advocate General’s Opinion, Viasat, by letter of 3 January 2017, requested the Court to reopen the oral part of the procedure.", "In support of its request, Viasat submits that the Advocate General’s Opinion distorts some of its arguments and raises separate arguments which were not debated between the parties.", "12", "It should be borne in mind that, according to Article 83 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that court may, at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court, or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.", "13", "However, the Statute and those Rules make no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk, C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).", "14", "In that regard, it follows from the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU that it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which require his involvement.", "The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General’s Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based.", "Consequently, a party’s disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions examined in that Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraphs 60 and 61 and the case-law cited).", "15", "The Court therefore considers, having heard the Advocate General, that it has before it all the necessary information to give judgment and that the information has been the subject of debate between the parties.", "16", "In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.", "The appeal", "The first plea, alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU", "Arguments of the parties", "17", "By its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measures concerned in the light of the requirements set out in Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular those providing that, first, the application of the rules of the Treaties must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned and, secondly, the performance of those tasks must not affect the development of trade as would be contrary to the interests of the European Union, was not required to take into consideration the fact that those measures did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions.", "According to those conditions, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation for the performance of the public service is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner, and that compensation must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical and well run undertaking would have incurred in performing the public service tasks concerned.", "18", "Viasat claims that it is apparent from the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU that the requirement that the application of the rules in the Treaties, in particular the competition rules, must obstruct the performance of the tasks assigned must be interpreted so as to refer to the other provisions of the Treaty.", "Thus, in an assessment of the compatibility of State aid in the light of Article 106(2) TFEU, those other provisions must be examined beforehand.", "Therefore, in the present case it should, according to Viasat, have been ascertained in this connection whether or not the application of any of the Altmark conditions obstructed the performance of the public service tasks assigned to TV2.", "Had that examination taken place, the Commission would have concluded that the adoption, in favour of TV2, of measures meeting the second and fourth Altmark conditions would not have obstructed the performance of that task.", "19", "Consequently, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements that the performance of the tasks at issue must be obstructed and the development of trade cannot be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union, the Commission should have requested the Kingdom of Denmark to prove that complying with the second and fourth Altmark conditions would have prevented the performance of the tasks of general economic interest assigned to TV2.", "20", "The Commission, the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S contend that the first ground of appeal is unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "21", "By its first ground of appeal, Viasat claims that the General Court erred in law in finding that the Commission was not required, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, to take the second and fourth Altmark conditions into consideration in order to ascertain whether compliance with those conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.", "22", "In this connection it must be recalled that, for a national measure to be categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, there must, first, be an intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient and, fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).", "23", "Since those conditions are cumulative, a State measure cannot be characterised as State aid if one of them is not satisfied.", "By contrast, if all those conditions are met, that measure constitutes State aid and, accordingly, unless it is covered by a derogation provided for by the Treaties, is incompatible with the internal market.", "24", "So far as concerns the third criterion for characterising a measure as State aid, it is settled case-law that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are regarded as State aid (see judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C‑270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraph 34).", "25", "However, the Court has stated that, where a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations, so that those undertakings do not enjoy a real financial advantage and the measure thus does not have the effect of putting them in a more favourable competitive position than the undertakings competing with them, such a measure is not caught by Article 107(1) TFEU (see judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 87).", "26", "In accordance with paragraphs 88 to 93 of the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), in order for such a measure not to be characterised as State aid a number of conditions must be met.", "First, the recipient undertaking must actually have public service obligations to discharge, and the obligations must be clearly defined.", "Second, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner.", "Third, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations.", "Fourth, the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations.", "27", "If the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph were not met, the State measure at issue would be deemed to confer a selective advantage on the recipient undertaking and if, moreover, the other criteria set out in Article 107(1) TFEU were met, that measure would constitute aid in principle incompatible with the internal market.", "28", "Article 106(2) TFEU provides that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are to be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them and that the development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union.", "29", "As is provided by case-law, the wording of Article 106(2) TFEU itself shows that exemptions to the Treaty rules are permitted provided that they are necessary for performance of the particular tasks assigned to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 54 and of 28 February 2013, Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas, C‑1/12, EU:C:2013:127, paragraph 106).", "30", "In that regard, it is clear from the Court’s case-law that it is not necessary that the financial balance or economic viability of the undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest should be threatened.", "It is sufficient that, in the absence of the rights at issue, it would not be possible for the undertaking to perform the particular tasks entrusted to it, or that maintenance of those rights is necessary to enable the holder of them to perform tasks of general economic interest which have been assigned to it under economically acceptable conditions (judgment of 15 November 2007, International Mail Spain, C‑162/06, EU:C:2007:681, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).", "31", "In allowing derogations to be made from the general rules of the Treaty in certain circumstances, Article 106(2) TFEU seeks to reconcile the Member States’ interest in using certain undertakings, in particular in the public sector, as an instrument of economic or fiscal policy with the Union’s interest in ensuring compliance with the rules on competition and the preservation of the unity of the common market (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 October 1997, Commission v France, C‑159/94, EU:C:1997:501, paragraph 55).", "32", "As set out in paragraph 21 above, Viasat submits that the Commission was required to examine, in its assessment under Article 106(2) TFEU, whether meeting the second and the fourth Altmark conditions would have obstructed the performance by TV2 of the tasks assigned to it.", "33", "It must be pointed out in this connection that in order to assess a measure under Article 106(2) TFEU, the Commission is not required, contrary to what is claimed by the appellant, to examine whether the conditions laid down by the case-law in Altmark, in particular the second and fourth of those conditions, are met.", "34", "As the General Court indeed held in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, verification of the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law occurs upstream, that is to say in the examination of the issue of whether the measures at issue must be characterised as State aid.", "That issue must be resolved before the one which consists in examining, where necessary, if incompatible aid is nevertheless necessary to the performance of the tasks assigned to the recipient of the measure at issue, under Article 106(2) TFEU.", "35", "By contrast, the conditions laid down in the Altmark case-law are no longer to be applied where the Commission, having found that a measure must be characterised as aid, in particular in so far as the recipient undertaking is unable to pass the test of comparison with a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public-service requirements, examines whether that aid can be justified under Article 106(2) TFEU.", "36", "That latter provision, which is supplemented by the Protocol (No. 26) on Services of General Interest (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 308) and, as regards the field at issue in the present case, by the Protocol (No. 29) on the System of Public Broadcasting in the Member States (OJ 2010 C 83, p. 312), cannot be interpreted in isolation having regard merely to its wording without also taking into account the additional information in those protocols.", "37", "The finding in paragraph 35 of the present judgment is supported, as the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, by the wording of Protocol No. 29, which states that ‘the provisions of the Treaties shall be without prejudice to the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of public service broadcasting and in so far as such funding is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of the public service remit as conferred, defined and organised by each Member State, and in so far as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Union to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest, while the realisation of the remit of that public service shall be taken into account.’", "38", "Having regard to the foregoing considerations, the General Court therefore did not err in law when it held in the judgment under appeal that Article 106(2) TFEU does not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision.", "39", "The first ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.", "The second ground of appeal, alleging breach of Article 296 TFEU", "Arguments of the parties", "40", "By its second ground of appeal, Viasat takes issue with paragraphs 103 and 104 of the judgment under appeal on the ground that the General Court erred in law by rejecting its plea for annulment based on the Commission’s infringement in the contested decision of its obligation to state reasons under Article 296 TFEU.", "41", "Viasat also alleges that the General Court failed to reply to the pleas raised in the application at first instance. 42", "The Commission contends that the second ground of appeal is in part inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "43", "It is settled case-law that the statement of reasons required under Article 296 TFEU must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the competent Court of the European Union to exercise its jurisdiction to review legality (judgment of 29 September 2011, Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C‑521/09 P, EU:C:2011:620, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited).", "44", "It must be observed in this connection that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the plea alleging a failure to state reasons in the contested decision by stating that ‘the fact that the contested decision does not mention the role of the second and fourth Altmark conditions in the assessment of the compatibility of the measures concerned with the internal market is not attributable to an error of reasoning on the part of the Commission or to a failure to state reasons vitiating the contested decision, but rather to the fact that that decision applies a different analytical framework from that which favours [Viasat]’.", "45", "As Viasat has conceded, the contested decision would only be vitiated by a failure to state reasons if the Commission had been required to apply the analytical framework which, according to Viasat, results from Article 106(2) TFEU.", "46", "However, it follows from paragraph 37 above that Article 106(2) TFEU did not require the Commission to take into consideration the second and fourth Altmark conditions in order to decide whether State aid is compatible with the internal market under that provision.", "Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in holding that sufficient reasons were stated for the contested decision.", "47", "Moreover, as the Advocate General observed in point 58 of his Opinion, the complaint alleging a failure to respond to the pleas raised in the application at first instance is insufficiently developed for the other parties to the appeal to respond to or for the Court to rule on.", "Consequently, it is inadmissible.", "48", "Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected as in part inadmissible and in part unfounded.", "49", "It

of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities (now ‘the General Court’) in Joined Cases T‑427/04 and T‑17/05 France and France Télécom v Commission [2009] ECR II‑4315 (‘the judgment under

decision’).", "The facts of the dispute", "2 In the judgment under appeal, the General Court set out the legal background and the facts of the dispute before it as follows:", "‘…", "2.", "Liability of FT to business tax", "General business tax regime", "16 Business tax is a local tax, the rules of which are laid down by statute and codified in the General Tax Code.", "17 … business tax is payable each year by natural or legal persons regularly pursuing a self-employed occupation as at 1 January.", "18 … the imposition of business tax depends on the taxable person’s ability to pay, which is assessed in accordance with economic criteria on the basis of the extent of the business activities engaged in by the taxable person in the territory of the recipient body.", "19 It follows that the business tax is not based on the profit made by the undertaking’s business, but, at the material time, on a proportion of the value of the production factors – capital and labour – used by the taxable person in each municipality in which the tax is established.", "20 … for taxation relating to the years 1994 to 2002, in the case of legal persons liable to corporation tax, the basis for the business tax included (i) the rental value of the fixed assets which the taxable person had used to meet its business requirements during the reference period and (ii) a proportion of the salaries paid during the reference period.", "21 … the reference period … is to be the penultimate year preceding the year of taxation, where the financial year coincides with the calendar year, or, where that is not the case, the financial year ending during the penultimate year preceding the year of taxation.", "22 … the business tax is to be established in each municipality in which the taxable person has premises or land, on the basis of the rental value of the assets situated in that municipality or connected with it, and the salaries paid to staff.", "…", "Rules applicable to FT", "Principle of liability to tax under the ordinary law", "25 Law No 90‑568 [of 2 July 1990 on the organisation of the public postal and telecommunications services (JORF of 8 July 1990, p. 8069) (‘Law No 90‑568’)], by which FT … [was] founded, lays down special tax provisions.", "26 … subject to [certain] exceptions … FT is [in principle] to be subject to duties and taxes … payable by private undertakings carrying out the same transactions.", "Fixed levy", "27 … FT was, until 1 January 1994, to be subject only to such duties and taxes as were actually borne by the State.", "Consequently, FT was not liable inter alia for corporation tax or local taxes, such as business tax.", "In exchange, FT had to pay, for the years 1991 to 1993, a contribution fixed each year by the Finance Law, subject to a maximum amount, the base for which, before the application of discount factors, was equal to the balance shown by the additional budget for telecommunications for the year 1989 …", "Special tax regime", "…", "30 The tax [payable by way of business tax] – the basis of assessment for which, for the purposes of calculating specific tax bases, followed the general rules laid down in the General Tax Code … – was established through the application of a national weighted average rate, based on the rates voted the previous year by all the local authorities …", "31 Furthermore, a rate of 1.9% – instead of 8% – was applied to FT in respect of management costs, that is to say, an additional sum levied by the State to offset the expenses incurred by the tax authorities in assessing tax and collecting business tax for the local authorities.", "32 The tax revenue had to be paid to the State or, for the proportion exceeding the contribution paid for the year 1994, adjusted each year to reflect the fluctuation in the consumer price index, to the Fonds national de péréquation de la taxe professionnelle (National Business Tax Equalisation Fund) …", "…", "3.", "Administrative procedure", "35 On 13 March 2001, the Association des collectivités territoriales pour le retour de la taxe professionnelle de France Télécom et de La Poste dans le droit commun (Association of local authorities for the reinstatement under the general law of the business tax regime applicable to FT and La Poste) submitted a complaint to the Commission to the effect that the special tax regime constituted State aid which was incompatible with the common market.", "The complainant referred inter alia to the loss of revenue for certain municipalities as a result of the application of a national weighted average rate.", "36 Following that complaint, the Commission decided on 28 June 2001 to initiate the preliminary investigation procedure in respect of the special tax regime and sent the French Republic a request for information.", "37 By letter of 26 September 2001, the French Republic replied that the special tax regime did not constitute State aid, because it did not confer any advantage on FT and entailed no loss of State resources.", "38 On 30 January 2003, the Commission adopted a decision initiating the formal investigation procedure provided for under Article 88(2) EC in respect inter alia of the exemption from business tax granted to FT from 1991 to 1993 and of the special tax regime (“the decision initiating the formal investigation”).", "The decision initiating the formal investigation was notified to the French Republic by letter of 31 January 2003.", "At the request of the French authorities, the Commission notified a rectified version of that decision on 7 March 2003.", "In the decision initiating the formal investigation, the Commission estimated the advantage conferred on FT as being worth approximately FRF 1 000 million per annum since 1994 (paragraphs 73 and 74).", "The initiation decision was published on 12 March 2003 (OJ 2003 C 57, p. 5).", "…", "4.", "The contested decision", "53 On 19 and 20 July 2004, at its 1 667th meeting, the College of Commissioners approved a draft decision finding that FT had received State aid during the period from 1994 to 2002 by virtue of the special tax regime (“the aid at issue”) and empowered the Member responsible for competition to adopt, with the agreement of the President, the definitive version of the decision in French – the authentic language – after “legal linguistic revision”.", "54 On 2 August 2004, the Commission adopted [the contested decision].", "It was notified to the French Republic on 3 August 2004.", "…", "61 In the contested decision, the Commission found, first, that the fixed levy, provided … for the period from 1991 to 1993, could be regarded as replacing the business tax normally payable for those years.", "Accordingly, the exemption from business tax during that period did not constitute State aid (recitals 22 to 33 and 53 [of the contested decision]).", "62 On the other hand, the Commission found that the special tax regime applicable from 1994 to 2002 introduced State aid consisting in the difference between the tax which FT should have paid under the general law and the amount of business tax actually paid (“the tax differential”).", "Moreover, that new aid, implemented unlawfully in breach of Article 88(3) EC, was incompatible with the common market.", "It therefore had to be recovered (recitals 34 to 53 of the contested decision).", "63 The Commission gave the following reasons for categorising the special tax regime as State aid for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC.", "64 First, the Commission set out the reasons why it considered it appropriate to discount the argument of the French authorities to the effect that the advantage found during the period from 1994 to 2002 was more than offset by the fixed levy which FT had had to pay during the period from 1991 to 1993 (recitals 35 to 41 of the contested decision).", "65 First of all, the Commission states that Law No 90‑568 had established two successive and distinct tax regimes: (i) an exemption regime, applicable from 1991 to 1993, under which a fixed levy replaced the general law taxes, including business tax, and (ii) a special regime introduced by way of derogation, as a result of which business tax was underpaid and which initially applied from 1994 and which was terminated with effect from the 2003 tax assessments (recitals 36 and 38 of the contested decision).", "…", "67 Consequently, the Commission found that it could not agree that the tax differential from which FT had benefited between 1994 and 2002 had been offset by the fixed levy paid between 1991 and 1993, which was not connected with business tax either specifically by Law No 90‑568 or by the method by which it was calculated (recital 38 of the contested decision).", "68 Moreover, the Commission found that payment of the fixed levy at issue was more akin to paying a share of the earnings to the owner of the capital than to taxation.", "In those circumstances, it was only by way of exception that the Commission had been able to accept that the levy offset the total exemption from business tax from which FT had benefited from 1991 to 1993.", "A normal application of the law could, on the contrary, have led to the conclusion that that exemption constituted State aid, the amount of which should have been added to that of the tax differential enjoyed by FT since 1994 under the special tax regime (recitals 38 and 39 of the contested decision).", "69 Lastly, the Commission found that the argument that the payments made by FT to the State between 1991 and 1993 should be set off against the under-taxation of FT from 1994 would involve categorising the surplus tax paid by FT (as compared with the tax payable under the general law) between 1991 and 1993 as a tax credit, which was not the aim of Law No 90‑568.", "Nor, according to the Commission, does that a posteriori theoretical justification reflect the normal application of French tax law: rather, it is designed solely to prevent recovery of the State aid granted to FT (recital 40 of the contested decision).", "70 Secondly, the Commission found that the tax differential represented an advantage for FT, granted from resources which should have been incorporated into the budget of the State and accordingly constituted State aid (recital 42 of the contested decision).", "71 Thirdly, in recitals 43 and 44 of the contested decision, the Commission stated that, in order to determine the net advantage from which FT had benefited, it could not take into consideration, at the stage of the decision establishing the existence of State aid, the French Republic’s argument that the corporation tax factor should be corrected downwards because of the higher amounts paid by way of business tax …", "72 Fourthly, the Commission – rejecting the arguments submitted by the French Republic to the effect that the aid at issue could not be recovered because of the limitation rules laid down in Article 15 of [Council] Regulation [EC] No 659/1999 [of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [88 EC] (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1)] – found that the aid at issue was new aid, not existing aid (recital 45 [of the contested decision]).", "73 First, the Commission stated that the expiry of the limitation period laid down in Article 15 of Regulation No 659/1999 did not have the effect of converting new aid into existing aid, but only of preventing the Commission from ordering the recovery of aid granted more than 10 years before the date on which time began to run for the purposes of barring recovery (recitals 46 to 48 of the contested decision).", "74 Second, the Commission argued that Law No 90‑568 had established an aid scheme and that any limitation concerns only the aid granted under that scheme and not the scheme itself.", "The point from which time starts to run is therefore the day on which each form of aid was actually granted to FT, that is to say, on the date, each year, on which the business tax was due (recital 49 of the contested decision).", "75 Third, the Commission added that the limitation period had been interrupted by the request for information sent to the French Republic on 28 June 2001 (recital 50 of the contested decision).", "76 The Commission therefore concluded that, since the first form of aid identified had been granted in 1994 – that is to say, fewer than 10 years before 28 June 2001 – the aid at issue had to be recovered in its entirety (recital 51 of the contested decision).", "77 Fifth, the Commission stated that the French authorities had not put forward any focused argument to prove that the aid at issue was compatible with the common market and that the Commission could see no legal basis on which it could be declared compatible with the common market (recital 52 [of the contested decision]).", "78 Consequently, in recital 53 of the contested decision, the Commission concluded that (i) the business tax regime applicable to FT during the period from 1991 to 1993 did not constitute State aid and (ii) the tax differential from which FT had benefited during the period from 1994 to 2002, as a consequence of the special tax regime, constituted State aid which was incompatible with the common market and which had been unlawfully implemented, and which must therefore be recovered.", "79 However, the exact amount to be recovered could not be determined, owing to the discrepancies in the information submitted by the French authorities during the administrative procedure.", "The Commission estimated that the aid to be recovered was in the amount – net of interest – of between EUR 798 million and EUR 1 140 million (recitals 54 to 59 [of the contested decision]).", "80 In recital 54 of the contested decision, the Commission referred to a report presented to the French Parliament by the Directorate-General for Taxes in November 2001, according to which “the immediate normalisation of the conditions of taxation of FT in relation to business tax would involve, at an unchanged rate, an over-taxation of almost 198 million euros for the company”.", "81 In addition, the Commission relied on the estimate of 15 May 2003, the results of which are set out in tabular form in recital 54 of the contested decision.", "According to the figures produced by the French Republic, the aggregate theoretical taxation of FT under the general law, for the years 1994 to 2002, was EUR 8 362 million.", "The aggregate actual taxation charged to FT for the same years, under the special tax regime, is EUR 7 222 million.", "The tax differential enjoyed by FT during the period from 1994 to 2002 is therefore EUR 1 140 million.", "82 The Commission also pointed out that, by letter of 29 January 2004, the French authorities had informed it of the amount of the tax charged to FT, under the general law, for the year 2003 (EUR 773 million) and confirmed that the estimate of 15 May 2003 was sound (recital 55 of the contested decision).", "It was not until the meetings held on 16 and 23 June 2003 that the French authorities contested the reliability of those figures (recitals 56 and 57 of the contested decision).", "83 On 5 July 2004, of the French authorities submitted a new estimate.", "This gave different results, reproduced in tabular form in recital 58 of the contested decision.", "The aggregate theoretical taxation of FT under the general law, for the years 1994 to 2002, had been reduced to EUR 8 020 million.", "The tax differential enjoyed by FT during the period from 1994 to 2002 is therefore EUR 798 million.", "84 Owing to the contradictory information provided by the French Republic during the administrative procedure, the Commission found that it was unable to determine the amount to be recovered, which was between EUR 798 million and EUR 1 140 million, plus interest.", "According to the Commission, the exact amount to be recovered had to be determined by the French authorities, in accordance with their duty to cooperate in good faith, when the contested decision was implemented (recitals 59 and 60 of the contested decision).", "85 In consequence of all the foregoing, the enacting terms of the contested decision state:", "“Article 1", "The State aid granted illegally by [the French Republic] in infringement of Article 88(3) [EC] to FT under the business tax scheme applicable to that company during the period 1 January 1994 to 31 December 2002 ... is incompatible with the common market.", "Article 2", "1. [The French Republic] shall take all necessary measures to recover from FT the aid referred to in Article 1.", "2.", "Recovery shall be effected without delay and in accordance with the procedures of national law provided that they allow the immediate and effective execution of this Decision.", "3.", "The aid to be recovered shall include interest from the date on which it was at the disposal of the recipient until the date of its recovery.", "…", "Article 3", "[The French Republic] shall inform the Commission, within two months of notification of this Decision, of the measures that it proposes to take and that it has already taken to comply with it.", "For that purpose, [the French Republic] shall use the questionnaire annexed to this Decision.", "Article 4", "This Decision is addressed to the French Republic.”", "86 On 25 October 2006, the Commission brought infringement proceedings, claiming that the Court of Justice should declare that, by failing to execute the contested decision within the prescribed period, the French Republic had failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 2 and 3 of that decision, under the fourth paragraph of Article 249 EC and under Article 10 EC.", "87 By judgment of 18 October 2007 in Case C-441/06 Commission v France [2007] ECR I-8887, the Court of Justice held that the action was well founded.’", "The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal", "3 In their actions before the General Court for annulment of the contested decision brought on 13 October 2004 and 10 January 2005 respectively, the French Republic and FT submitted, in essence, that the Commission was incorrect in finding, first, that FT had benefited from unlawful aid and, second, that the aid had to be repaid.", "4 By the judgment under appeal,the General Court rejected all the pleas put forward by the French Republic and FT .", "Forms of order sought by the parties", "5 FT claims that the Court should:", "– set aside the judgment under appeal;", "– give final judgment as to the substance, in accordance with Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and grant the forms of order sought by FT at first instance;", "– in the alternative, refer the case back to the General Court; and", "– order the Commission to pay the costs.", "6 The French Republic claims that the Court should:", "– set aside the judgment under appeal;", "– give final judgment as to the substance, in accordance with Article 61 of the Court’s Statute;", "– uphold the applicants’ claims at first instance;", "– in the alternative, refer the case back to the General Court; and", "– order the Commission to pay the costs.", "7 The Commission contends that the appeal should be dismissed and FT ordered to pay the costs.", "The appeal", "8 FT relies on five grounds of appeal, alleging that the General Court: (i) erred in law by classifying the special tax regime as State aid, when the existence of an advantage for FT depended on factors unrelated to that regime; (ii) misconstrued the concept of State aid in that the Commission failed to take account of the overall tax regime applicable to FT during the years from 1991 to 2002; (iii) failed to have proper regard for the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations; (iv) failed to state reasons in the judgment under appeal with regard to the principle of limitation and; (v) erred in law and failed to state adequate reasons for the judgment under appeal with regard to the principle of legal certainty.", "The first ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court erred in law by classifying the special tax regime as State aid, when the existence of an advantage for FT depended on factors unrelated to that regime", "Arguments of the parties", "9 FT submits that the existence of any financial advantage that may have been conferred on it as compared with the position under the general law depends on a range of variables, such as the different rates of business tax applicable in the French municipalities in which taxable assets are held and the geographical location of those assets.", "Consequently, the special tax regime applicable to FT from 1994 was not advantageous in itself and, as a result, the General Court should have rejected the classification of the tax regime at issue as State aid.", "10 FT takes the view that the General Court misconstrued the concept of State aid by finding, at paragraph 323 of the judgment under appeal, that the existence of any advantage did not depend on the specific features of the tax regime at issue, but on factors unrelated to that regime, the effects of which may be determined only ex post.", "The advantages or disadvantages deriving from those factors could not lead to a measure being characterised as aid when, at the time of its adoption, it could not be so characterised.", "11 The French Republic submits that a special tax regime is not in itself capable of constituting State aid.", "Such a regime would not necessarily confer a selective advantage on the undertakings concerned.", "12 The Commission considers that the ground of appeal in question is inadmissible, since it was not raised at first instance.", "13 The Commission also maintains that the ground is unfounded.", "It was not possible to determine in advance, for each year, the precise level of taxation under the special regime.", "However, that regime could have led to less tax being payable by comparison with the position under the general law on business tax.", "14 The Commission adds that it is not unusual for the examination of State aid to require account to be taken of events that took place after the occurrence of the measure in question, in order to determine whether such aid in fact existed and to quantify it in order to recover the advantage obtained.", "Findings of the Court", "15  With regard to the Commission’s claim that the first ground of appeal is inadmissible, it should be noted that that ground, which forms part of the submissions relating to the existence of State aid, was put forward at first instance in the context of the first and second pleas relied on before the General Court.", "16  As regards whether that ground is well founded, according to settled case-law, the definition of aid is more general than that of a subsidy.", "It includes not only positive benefits but also measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which thus, without being subsidies in the strict sense of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect (see, Joined Cases C‑78/08 to C‑80/08 Paint Graphos and Others [2011] ECR I‑0000, paragraph 45 and the case-law cited).", "17  It should also be noted that the concept of advantage that is intrinsic to the classification of a measure as State aid is an objective one, irrespective of the motives of the persons responsible for the measure in question.", "Accordingly, the nature of the objectives pursued by State measures and their grounds of justification have no bearing whatsoever on whether such measures are to be classified as State aid.", "It is established case-law that Article 87(1) EC does not distinguish between the causes or the objectives of State aid, but defines them in relation to their effects (see Case C‑409/00 Spain v Commission [2003] ECR I‑1487, paragraph 46 and the case-law cited).", "18  As regards the present case, it should be noted that the tax regime to which FT was subject during the second period under consideration, namely during the years from 1994 to 2002, constituted an exception to the general law regime.", "In particular, that company benefited from specific tax treatment at national level, characterised by the fact that business tax was calculated on the basis of a weighted average rate, as opposed to the various rates applicable in the different local authorities, whereas the rates to which other undertakings were subject were those voted annually by those authorities.", "Moreover, FT was subject to a single rate of business tax in its principle place of business, whereas other undertakings were taxed at the different rates voted by the local authorities in the territory within which those undertakings had establishments.", "A rate of 1.9% was also applied to FT, as opposed to the rate of 8% applicable to other undertakings, in respect of management costs.", "19  As regards the argument relied on in the present appeal that the General Court’s examination of the tax regime at issue should have taken account of a number of variables and extraneous factors, it should be noted that, even though, given the particular characteristics of that regime, the Commission was not in a position to determine in advance for each tax year the precise level of taxation for that year, it is nevertheless accepted that the regime was capable of resulting and in fact resulted – as is apparent from recital 59 of the contested decision and paragraph 225 of the judgment under appeal – in FT’s liability to business tax being lower than it would have been if the general law business tax regime had been applied.", "20  It should also be noted that, irrespective of the rates of business tax adopted by the local authorities, FT benefited in all circumstances from a reduced rate in respect of management costs.", "21", "In those circumstances, the General Court was correct to hold, at paragraph 323 of the judgment under appeal, that the finding of the existence of aid depended on a number of ‘circumstances unrelated to’ the special tax regime, such as the fact that the business tax was charged annually and the level of the tax rates voted each year by the authorities in the territory in which FT had establishments.", "22", "Contrary to the French Republic’s and FT’s claims, such circumstances do not in any way preclude the possibility that, even at the time of its adoption, the special tax regime could have been classified as State aid for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC.", "Indeed, it is necessary to make a distinction between, on the one hand, the adoption of an aid scheme, namely in the present case the special tax regime, and, on the other, the grant of annual aid to FT on the basis of that regime, the precise total amount of which depended on certain external factors.", "23", "As the Advocate General stated at point 59 of his Opinion, the present case involves a dual categorisation, in which the existence of an advantage is attributable, first, to a fixed element forming part of the special tax regime applied to FT, as opposed to the general law regime, and, second, to a variable element, which depends on factual circumstances, namely the location of premises or land in the various local authorities and the tax rate applicable in those authorities.", "24", "On account of its specific features, as described at paragraph 18 above, the special tax regime could have resulted in FT’s liability to tax being less than it would have been had it been subject to business tax under the general law regime.", "25", "The fact that FT’s liability to professional tax was indeed lower as of 1994 is directly attributable to the specific features of the special tax regime applied to it, even though the exact amount of annual aid received by it under that regime depended on certain factors unrelated to the regime.", "26", "It is also apparent from the structure of the judgment under appeal that paragraph 323 of that judgment, which refers to circumstances unrelated to the special tax regime, concerns only the annual aid granted to FT under the special tax regime.", "In fact, that paragraph forms part of the analysis of the plea relating to the limitation in time of the Commission’s power to recover unlawful aid.", "The findings of the General Court in connection with that plea can relate only to aid actually received and, therefore, concern only the aid from which FT benefited under the special tax regime.", "27", "It follows from those considerations that the General Court did not err in law in finding that the special tax regime conferred an advantage on FT for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC, even though the exact amount of aid granted under that regime had to be determined by reference to certain factors unrelated to the regime.", "28", "The first ground of appeal is therefore unfounded.", "The second ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court misconstrued the concept of State aid in that the Commission failed to take account of the overall tax regime applicable to FT during the years from 1991 to 2002", "29 The second ground of appeal relied on by FT is subdivided into three parts.", "It is appropriate to examine, first, the second part, relating to the purported misinterpretation of the contested decision.", "Second, the first and third parts of this ground of appeal will be examined together as they are closely connected.", "The second part of the second ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court erred in law in its misinterpretation of the contested decision and substituted its own grounds", "– Arguments of the parties", "30 FT maintains that the General Court misinterpreted the contested decision by concluding that the Commission considered that the aid at issue did not consist in the special tax provisions applicable to that company but in the tax differential established each year between the amounts actually paid by the company and the business tax that would have been due under the general law regime, thus substituting its own grounds for those of the decision.", "FT also submits that that interpretation is inconsistent with the enacting terms of the contested decision, according to which the aid at issue consists in the business tax scheme applicable to that company during the period from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 2002.", "The Commission therefore relied not on the fact that the tax differential established with effect from 1994 arose on an annual basis, but on other reasons of a different nature.", "31 The Commission argues in reply that the General Court’s reading of the contested decision in the judgment under appeal is consistent with the terms of the decision.", "It states that it was unnecessary to repeat in the enacting terms of the decision that the tax differential constituted an advantage.", "The aid from which FT benefited, which consisted in the under-taxation of that company as regards business tax between the years 1994 and 2002, was made available as a result of the business tax regime applicable to the company during that period.", "– Findings of the Court", "32", "At paragraph 201 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court examined the part of the contested decision which found that the aid derived from a tax differential representing the difference between the amount which FT would have had to pay by way of business tax contributions if it had been subject to the tax under the general law and the amount which it was actually charged under the tax regime at issue.", "The General Court verified that there was a genuine tax differential at paragraphs 219 to 225 of the judgment, without its findings in that regard being called into question by FT.", "33", "As regards the purported substitution of grounds on the part of the General Court, it is sufficient to note that the court did not exceed its powers of review in substituting its own assessment for that of the Commission, since the tax differential in question and the fact that the business tax is paid annually, as provided for in the General Tax Code, form an integral part of the reasoning adopted by the Commission in the contested decision.", "34", "Recital 42 of the contested decision states that ‘the difference between the business tax actually paid by FT and that which should have been due under the ordinary law from 1 January 1994 to 1 January 2003 constitutes State aid inasmuch as it represents an advantage for FT granted through resources which would otherwise have been incorporated in the budget of the State’.", "Recital 49 of the decision states that the professional tax was payable annually.", "Furthermore, the point is also made that business tax is payable annually at recital 25 of the decision initiating the formal investigation, to which recital 15 of the contested decision refers.", "35", "Consequently, the General Court’s interpretation to the effect that the aid at issue consisted in the tax differential deriving from the application of the provisions establishing a special regime is consistent with the enacting terms of the contested decision, which categorises the regime applicable to FT between the years 1994 and 2002 as aid which is incompatible with the common market.", "Indeed, it is by virtue of that special regime that FT was not required to pay business tax in the amounts for which it would normally have been liable under the general law tax regime.", "36", "The second part of the second ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.", "The first and third parts of the second ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court misconstrued the concept of State aid since it failed to carry out an overall analysis of the tax regime applicable to FT", "– Arguments of the parties", "37 FT submits that the General Court failed to have regard to the obligation to carry out a comprehensive examination of all the provisions under the regime which derogated from the general law.", "In order to determine whether there was an advantage, the General Court should have compared the charges imposed under the derogating regime with the level of taxation that would have been applied to it if the company had been taxed under the general law regime.", "However, it confined that comparison to the period from 1994 to 2002, without taking account of the tax burden borne by FT during the period from 1991 to 1993.", "38 FT is of the view that neither the fact that the tax is paid annually nor the differences between the two tax periods under consideration could justify a partial analysis confined to the tax regime applicable as of 1994.", "The General Court was therefore incorrect in refusing to take account of the fact that the company was over-taxed as a result of the fixed levy during the period from 1991 to 1993 when compared with the level of taxation it would have had to bear if it had been subject to the general law on business tax during that period.", "Even if the General Court were entitled in its analysis to take account of the fact that the business tax is payable annually, it should have recognised that, as regards the initial tax years under the general derogating tax scheme, namely from the years 1991 to 1993, the company was over-taxed.", "39 FT is also of the view that the General Court erred in law in relying, at paragraph 207 of the judgment under appeal, on Case C‑66/02 Italy v Commission [2005] ECR I‑10901.", "The General Court was incorrect in concluding, in reliance on that judgment, that FT benefited from a reduction in charges for the period from 1994 to 2002 which could not be offset by a specific charge imposed on that company in respect of the period from 1991 to 1993.", "40 Similarly, the French Republic maintains that the General Court misconstrued the concept of advantage when it adopted a restrictive approach as regards the link that must exist between an exemption and a charge established by the tax regime at issue.", "The General Court should have undertaken an overall analysis covering both the derogating scheme established by Law No 90‑568 – in particular any advantages conferred on FT by that scheme – and the charges payable by FT under the general law.", "41 The Commission submits that it is not possible to ‘offset’ aid by invoking charges of a different nature that are unconnected with the aid.", "That applies not only to the question of State resources but also that of the advantage conferred.", "A loss of State resources cannot be saved from categorisation as aid simply because such loss is ‘set off’ against other sums paid to the State in accordance with other obligations.", "Since there is no sufficient connection between the tax scheme applicable between 1991 and 1993 and the scheme in force as of 1994, the ‘offsetting’ supposition underlying FT’s argument is unfounded.", "– Findings of the Court", "42", "In the light of the arguments put forward by the parties, it is necessary to consider whether the General Court erred in law in finding, at paragraph 218 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had been correct in refusing in the contested decision to offset the amounts paid by FT by way of fixed levy from 1991 to 1993 against the tax differentials arising from the special tax regime for the period from 1994 to 2002, in order to determine whether that company benefited from State aid for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC.", "43", "While recognising that, when examining a measure likely to constitute State aid, the Commission is entitled to take account of the specific charges imposed on an advantage, the General Court nevertheless found, at paragraph 207 of the judgment under appeal, that a measure cannot be saved from categorisation as aid where the aid beneficiary is subject to a specific charge which is different from and unconnected with the aid in question.", "That affirmation on the part of the General Court is based on a correct interpretation of Article 87(1) EC (see Case 173/73 Italy v Commission [1974] ECR 709, paragraph 34), notwithstanding the fact that it referred incorrectly in that regard to the judgment in Case C‑66/02 Italy v Commission.", "44", "The General Court therefore did not err in law in finding, at paragraph 208 of the judgment under appeal, that the validity of the French Republic’s and FT’s argument that the over-taxation of FT between 1991 and 1993, attributable to the fixed levy to which it was subject, offset the tax differential from which that company benefited from 1994 to 2002 depends on the analysis of the objective characteristics of the fixed levy applicable between 1991 and 1993 and on whether it may be regarded as a charge which is connected with the advantage enjoyed by FT as a result of its being taxed under the special regime as of 1994.", "45", "It should be noted that the levy applicable to FT between 1991 and 1993 was determined by different parameters from those applied with effect from 1994 under the special tax regime.", "The two tax regimes were in fact based on different legal models and operating parameters.", "46", "As is apparent from recital 17 of the contested decision and paragraph 209 of the judgment under appeal, under the tax scheme applicable to FT from 1991 to 1993, it did not have to pay any tax or levy other than the fixed levy.", "The amount of the fixed levy was established not in accordance with the parameters used to determine the amount of business tax but by reference to the earnings paid to the State by the entity from 1989 to 1990.", "The fixed levy was also temporary.", "47", "On the other hand, under the special tax regime applicable from 1994 for an indefinite period, FT was required, in principle, to pay all the general law taxes.", "However, the rules governing its liability to business tax derogated from the general law and constituted the special tax regime.", "48", "In those circumstances, the General Court was entitled to find, at paragraph 213 of the judgment under appeal, that the fixed levy must be regarded not as a charge connected with the introduction of the special tax regime, but rather as a special tax mechanism for FT established for the years prior to 1994.", "In any event, as the General Court stated at paragraph 215 of the judgment under appeal, the mere fact that the fixed levy and the special tax regime were both introduced by Law No 90‑568 does not prove that FT’s liability to pay the fixed levy from 1991 to 1993 was connected with the creation of the special tax regime for the years after 1994.", "49", "The General Court did not, therefore, err in law in concluding, at paragraph 218 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was entitled to refuse to apply a set-off between, on the one hand, the amounts paid by FT between 1991 and 1993 by way of fixed levy and, on the other, the tax differentials arising as a result of the special tax regime established for that company for the years 1994 to 2002.", "50", "Lastly, even if it were the case that the tax regime applicable to FT consisted of two inextricably linked periods, the first entailing over-taxation and the second under-taxation, it is accepted that Law No 90-568 introduced with effect from 1994 a special tax regime intended to be of indefinite duration.", "That law did not contain any mechanism for offsetting amounts due by way of fixed levy for the period from 1991 to 1993 against amounts due as of 1994 under the special tax regime.", "It therefore provided no mechanism for determining the point at which over-taxation under the first regime should have been offset under the second regime.", "As the Advocate General observed at point 100 of his Opinion, that over-taxation should have exhausted its effects at a given time, which necessarily entailed the conferring of an advantage on FT under the special tax regime.", "51  The first and third parts of the second ground of appeal cannot therefore be upheld.", "Accordingly, the second ground must be rejected in its entirety.", "The third ground of appeal, alleging breach of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations", "52 The third ground of appeal put forward by FT comprises two parts.", "The first part of the third ground of appeal, alleging an error of law as regards the circumstances in which the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations may be relied on", "– Arguments of the parties", "53 FT claims, with regard to whether it is possible for it to rely on the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations, that the General Court erred in confining the situations in which it is possible to take account of certain exceptional circumstances to cases in which aid has been notified.", "The fact that, in the present case, it was possible to identify the existence of an advantage only a posteriori, in the light of changing circumstances unrelated to the special tax regime, constitutes such exceptional circumstances.", "54 FT states that the General Court did not identify either the legal act that should have been notified or the date on which notification should have occurred.", "If the advantage consisted in a tax differential established at the end of each tax year, it would be impossible to identify an obligation of prior notification of the tax regime at issue.", "55 FT adds that the General Court disregarded the fact that the intentions of the national legislature were among the factors to be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining whether that company could have entertained a legitimate expectation that the tax measure at issue complied with the rules on State aid.", "56 The Commission states that undertakings receiving aid can, in principle, have a legitimate expectation that the aid will be deemed lawful only if it is granted in accordance with the procedure laid down in the EC Treaty.", "57 It submits that the special tax regime applicable to FT during the period from 1994 to 2002 was introduced by way of derogation, was selective, attributable to the State and applied to a company active in markets open to competition and to trade between Member States.", "Consequently, the national authorities should have notified the special business tax regime applicable to that company before the date on which that tax became chargeable.", "– Findings of the Court", "58", "It should be recalled, first, that the obligation to notify is one of the fundamental features of the system of control put in place by the Treaty in the field of State aid.", "Under that system, Member States are under an obligation, first, to notify to the Commission each measure intended to grant new aid or alter aid for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC and, second, not to implement such a measure, in accordance with Article 88(3) EC, until that institution has taken a final decision on the measure.", "59", "Consequently, in view of the mandatory nature of the review of State aid by the Commission, undertakings to which aid has been granted may not, in principle, entertain a legitimate expectation that the aid is lawful unless it has been granted in compliance with the procedure laid down in Article 88 EC and a diligent business operator should normally be able to determine whether that procedure has been followed.", "In particular, where aid is implemented without prior notification to the Commission, with the result that it is unlawful under Article 88(3) EC, the recipient of the aid cannot have at that time a legitimate expectation that its grant is lawful (see Joined Cases C‑183/02 P and C‑187/02 P Demesa and Territorio Histórico de Álava v Commission [2004] ECR I‑10609, paragraphs 44 and 45 and case-law cited).", "60", "Moreover, the Court has held that, where aid has not been notified to the Commission, any apparent failure to act on its part in relation to the measure is irrelevant (see Demesa and Territorio Histόrico de Álava v Commission, paragraph 52).", "61", "With regard to the present dispute, it is accepted that the tax regime at issue, which was introduced by Law No 90‑568, was not notified to the Commission.", "62", "In so far as FT argues that there was no obligation to notify, because it had not been established that there was an advantage, it should be noted that neither the purported complexity of the tax regime at issue nor the periodic nature of the aid measure can release the Member State from its obligation to notify or give rise to any legitimate expectation on the part of the company receiving the aid.", "63", "As regards the possible relevance of exceptional circumstances which may give rise, notwithstanding the considerations set out in the preceding paragraph, to a legitimate expectation that aid is lawful, it is sufficient to note that the General Court did not err in law in assessing such circumstances in the course of its detailed examination, at paragraphs 263 to 269 of the judgment under appeal, of all the arguments relied on before it in that regard.", "64", "Consequently, the General Court concluded correctly, at paragraph 270 of the judgment under appeal, that the French Republic and FT had failed to prove the existence of exceptional circumstances enabling them to rely on the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations.", "65  It must therefore be concluded that the first part of the third ground of appeal is unfounded.", "The second part of the third ground of appeal, alleging an error in law as to the legal consequences flowing from another Commission decision on State aid", "– Arguments of the parties", "66 FT is of the view that the General Court misinterpreted the legal consequences flowing from the Commission’s decision of 8 February 1995 on La Poste (OJ 1995 C 262, p. 11) (‘the La Poste decision’).", "67 FT submits that that decision was a positive act capable of producing legal effects and giving rise to a legitimate expectation that the tax regime at issue complied with the rules on State aid.", "68 The Commission states that, since the special tax regime constituted a procedure for imposing business tax which derogated from the general law, it was capable of conferring an advantage on FT.", "In view of that regime’s particular characteristics, notification should have taken place no later than the date on which the business tax for which that company was liable for 1994 became chargeable.", "69 The Commission considers that another State aid investigation procedure could not give rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of FT concerning the special tax regime from which it benefited.", "– Findings of the Court", "70", "As stated at paragraphs 59 and 60 above, the recipient of aid cannot, in principle, rely on considerations based on the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations where the aid in question has not been notified to the Commission.", "71", "The argument based on the La Poste decision does not contain any analysis of the special business tax regime applicable to FT.", "Accordingly, the General Court could do no other than point out, at paragraph 266 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had expressed no opinion at all on that special tax regime and had not, therefore, taken a view on whether it constituted aid.", "72", "As regards the argument that FT could have interpreted the context in which the La Poste decision was adopted as a definition of the Commission’s opinion on the tax regime at issue, it must be noted that the General Court, without erring in law, rejected that argument at paragraphs 265 to 269 of the judgment under appeal.", "73", "Consequently, the General Court was entitled to find that there was nothing of relevance in the La Poste decision that could have given rise to any legitimate expectation on the part of FT that the tax regime at issue was lawful in the light of the rules on State aid.", "The second part of the third ground of appeal is, therefore, unfounded.", "74 In the light of the foregoing considerations, the third ground of appeal must be rejected in its entirety.", "The fourth ground of appeal, alleging a failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal with regard to the response to the arguments relating to the principle of limitation", "Arguments of the parties", "75 FT states that the French authorities explained, in the course of the administrative procedure, that any under-taxation during the period from 1994 to 2002 could not, in any event, be recovered, given that the tax regime at issue was introduced more than 10 years previously.", "Article 15 of Regulation No 659/1999 provides that Commission’s powers to recover aid are subject to a limitation period of 10 years.", "76 According to FT, the General Court failed to adjudicate on the principle of limitation thus relied on before it.", "Instead, it substituted its own grounds in that regard for those of the contested decision.", "Moreover, the judgment under appeal did not specify the binding legal act which determined the point at which the limitation period began to run.", "The act which triggered the limitation period was Law No 90‑568.", "77 The French Republic maintains that the General Court erred in law in finding that the limitation period in respect of the aid at issue could not have started to run before 1994.", "Even if it were accepted that the special tax regime constituted State aid, the only binding legal act identifiable for the purpose of determining the point at which the limitation period started to run as regards the measure in question was Law No 90‑568, which entered into force on 2 July 1990.", "The Commission decided to initiate the preliminary investigation procedure relating to FT’s special tax regime by sending a request for information to the French authorities on 28 June 2001.", "By that date, the limitation period pertaining to the Commission’s duty to recover aid had expired.", "78 The Commission submits that the General Court was required to determine only whether recovery of the aid granted to FT under the special business tax regime in force from 1994 was time-barred.", "Consequently, the complaint that the General Court substituted its own grounds for those of the contested decision cannot be accepted.", "79 The Commission states that the rules on limitation relating to State aid concern the recovery of such aid.", "Aid may be recovered only if it is possible to determine the aid amount.", "As regards the tax regime at issue, it was possible to identify the advantage only on an annual basis and a posteriori.", "Findings of the Court", "80", "As regards the principle of limitation, Article 15(1) of Regulation No 659/1999 provides that the powers of the Commission to recover aid are to be subject to a limitation period of 10 years.", "It is apparent from Article 15(2) of the regulation that the limitation period does not begin to run until on the day on which the unlawful aid is awarded to the beneficiary.", "Consequently, the decisive factor in determining the starting point of the limitation period referred to in Article 15 is when the aid was in fact granted.", "81", "It is apparent from Article 15(2) of Regulation No 659/1999 that, for the purpose of determining the date on which the limitation period starts to run, that provision refers to the grant of aid to a beneficiary, not the date on which an aid scheme was adopted.", "82", "The determination of the date on which aid was granted may vary depending on the nature of the aid in question.", "Thus, in the case of a multi-annual scheme, entailing payments or advantages granted on a periodic basis, the date on which an act forming the legal basis of the aid is adopted and the date on which the undertakings concerned will actually be granted the aid may be a considerable period of time apart.", "In such a case, for the purpose of calculating the limitation period, the aid must be regarded as not having been awarded to the beneficiary until the date on which it was in fact received by the beneficiary.", "83", "It should be noted that, at recital 49 of the contested decision, the Commission stated that the limitation period started to run each year on the date on which the business tax was due from FT.", "84", "As is apparent from paragraph 320 of the judgment under appeal, the limitation period starts to run afresh each time an advantage is actually granted, which may be on an annual basis, so that the calculation of the limitation period may depend on how the advantage is identified.", "85", "In the present case, since the finding as to whether aid existed depended on the different rates applicable in each municipality within whose territory FT’s establishments were situated, the General Court carried out an analysis, at paragraph 323 of the judgment under appeal, of the fact that business tax is charged annually and the consequences flowing from this.", "86", "The General Court was therefore correct in finding, at paragraph 324 of the judgment under appeal, that, in view of the annual nature of business tax, the aid at issue could not be regarded as having been awarded before the year 1994, because that was the year in which the binding legal acts were adopted which made it possible, for the first time, to establish the existence of a tax differential.", "87", "Moreover, the approach adopted by the General Court is confirmed by the wording of Article 15(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, from which it is apparent that it is the Commission’s powers to recover aid which are subject to a limitation period.", "88", "Lastly, as regards the argument that the General Court failed to have regard to the obligation to state reasons in relation to the principle of limitation, it is settled case-law that that court is not thereby required to provide an account that follows exhaustively and point by point all the reasoning articulated by the parties to the case.", "The reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why the measures in question were taken and provides the competent court with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (see Case C‑105/04 P Nederlandse Federatieve Vereniging voor de Groothandel op Electrotechnisch Gebied v Commission [2006] ECR I‑8725, paragraph 72; and Case C‑3/06 P Groupe Danone v Commission [2007] ECR I‑1331, paragraph 46).", "89", "It should be noted in that connection that, at paragraphs 323 and 324 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court provided a clear assessment of the characteristics of the business tax scheme, which enabled it to conclude, at paragraph 325 of the judgment, that the limitation period provided for under Article 15 of Regulation No 659/1999 had not expired by 28 June 2001, the date on which a request for information was sent to the French Republic.", "90", "In those circumstances, the Court finds that the General Court responded to the requisite legal standard to the arguments relating to the principle of limitation relied on by FT and did not disregard the requirement to state reasons established in the case-law cited at paragraph 88 above.", "91  In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the fourth ground of appeal cannot be accepted.", "The fifth ground of appeal, alleging an error of law and failure to state reasons in the judgment under appeal in relation to the arguments alleging breach of the principle of legal certainty", "92 The fifth ground of appeal relied on by FT comprises two parts.", "Arguments of the parties", "– The first part of the fifth ground of appeal, alleging failure to state reasons and error of law on account of the fact that it is impossible to establish the amount of aid to be recovered", "93 FT claims that the General Court failed to respond to its argument that, where the Commission examines an advantage the true amount of which cannot be established, it cannot order recovery of such an advantage.", "94 FT infers from this that the General Court infringed the principle of legal certainty since any amount to be recovered remains hypothetical and the quantification of recoverable aid cannot be based on approximate estimates.", "– The second part of the fifth ground of appeal, alleging failure to state reasons and error of law as regards the assessment of the methods of obtaining an approximate amount of the aid", "95 FT submits that the General Court erred in law by finding, at paragraphs 297 and 305 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was justified in establishing a range encompassing the amount of aid to be recovered on the basis of estimates provided by the French authorities and that breach of the principle of legal certainty could not therefore be established.", "96 FT explains that the estimates in question were not forwarded by the French authorities with a view to determining the actual extent of the tax differential during the period from 1994 to 2002.", "Those calculations were provided to demonstrate that any under-taxation of the company during that period was offset by the over-taxation which occurred during the first years of the special tax regime, namely during the period from 1991 to 1993.", "97 In its response to the two parts of the fifth ground of appeal, the Commission submits that, in its findings concerning the principle of legal certainty, the General Court simply drew the appropriate conclusions from a number of elements in the judgment in Case C‑441/06 Commission v France [2007] ECR I‑8887.", "98 The Commission therefore considers that the General Court gave appropriate reasons for its conclusion that FT was not justified in its submission that the principle of legal certainty had been infringed on the sole ground that, in order for the aid at issue to be recovered, it was necessary to specify the amount of aid.", "Findings of the Court", "99 On account of the connection between them, it is appropriate to examine both parts of the fifth ground of appeal together.", "100", "The principle of legal certainty – which is one of the general principles of European Union law – requires that rules of law be clear and precise and predictable in their effect, so that interested parties can ascertain their position in situations and legal relationships governed by European Union law (see, to that effect, Case C‑63/93 Duff and Others [1996] ECR I-569, paragraph 20; Case C‑76/06 P Britannia Alloys andamp; Chemicals v Commission [2007] ECR I‑4405, paragraph 79; and Case C‑158/07 Förster [2008] ECR I‑8507, paragraph 67).", "101", "As regards the argument relied on in support of the fifth ground of appeal, it should be observed that the General Court pointed out, at paragraph 301 of the judgment under appeal, that, on the basis of the Commission’s estimates, the aid at issue amounted to between EUR 798 million and EUR 1 140 million.", "Since those figures delimit the range within which the final amount was to be established, the General Court found, referring in particular to paragraphs 31 to 40 of Commission v France, that the contested decision contained the appropriate information to enable that amount to be determined without too much difficulty.", "102", "It should also be noted that the Court of Justice held, at paragraph 29 of Commission v France, that no provision of European Union law requires the Commission, when ordering the recovery of aid declared incompatible with the common market, to fix the exact amount of the aid to be recovered.", "It is sufficient for the Commission’s decision to include information enabling the recipient to calculate the amount itself, without overmuch difficulty (see also Case C‑480/98 Spain v Commission [2000] ECR I-8717, paragraph 25, and Case C‑415/03 Commission v Greece [2005] ECR I-3875, paragraph 39).", "103", "Thus, the General Court stated, at paragraphs 302 and 303 of the judgment under appeal, that that range was based on estimates provided by the French authorities during the administrative procedure and that, since that Member State had been unable to calculate exactly the amount of the advantage from which FT had benefited under the regime at issue, the Commission was entitled to rely on the data thus provided.", "104", "In those circumstances, the General Court correctly concluded, at paragraph 305 of the judgment under appeal, that the contested decision did not constitute a breach of the principle of legal certainty.", "105", "It follows from the foregoing that neither the French Republic nor FT can rely on that principle in order to prevent recovery of unlawful aid (see Case C‑148/04 Unicredito Italiano [2005] ECR I‑11137, paragraph 104).", "106", "The General Court was therefore entitled to find that the contested decision is not vitiated by unlawfulness because it simply refers to an indicative range as regards the amount of aid to be recovered.", "107", "Moreover, it is apparent from paragraphs 301 to 305 of the judgment under appeal that the judgment is not vitiated by an inadequate statement of reasons as regards the assessment of the plea alleging breach of the principle of legal certainty raised by FT and the French Republic.", "108", "The fifth ground of appeal relied on by FT cannot succeed and it must therefore be rejected in its entirety.", "Costs", "109 Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, which applies to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 118 thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "Since the Commission applied for costs against FT and the latter has been unsuccessful, the appellant must be ordered to pay the costs.", "The French Republic must

December 2008 in Case T‑388/02 Kronoply and Kronotex v Commission (‘the judgment under appeal’), by which the Court of First Instance of the European Communities (now ‘the General Court’) declared admissible the action brought by Kronoply GmbH andamp; Co.", "KG and Kronotex GmbH andamp; Co.", "KG (collectively, ‘Kronoply and Kronotex’) for the annulment of Commission Decision C(2002) 2018 final of 19 June 2002 to raise no objections to the State aid granted by the German authorities to Zellstoff Stendal GmbH (‘ZSG’) (‘the contested decision’).", "Legal context", "2 According to Recital 2 in the preamble to Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [88] of the EC Treaty (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1), that regulation seeks to codify and reinforce the consistent practice developed and established by the Commission, in accordance with the case-law of the Court, for the application of Article 88 EC.", "3 Article 1 of Regulation No 659/1999 provides:", "‘For the purpose of this Regulation:", "…", "(h) “interested party” shall mean any Member State and any person, undertaking or association of undertakings whose interests might be affected by the granting of aid, in particular the beneficiary of the aid, competing undertakings and trade associations.’", "4 Under paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999, which is entitled ‘Preliminary examination of the notification and decisions of the Commission’:", "‘2.", "Where the Commission, after a preliminary examination, finds that the notified measure does not constitute aid, it shall record that finding by way of a decision.", "3.", "Where the Commission, after a preliminary examination, finds that no doubts are raised as to the compatibility with the common market of a notified measure, in so far as it falls within the scope of Article [87(1)] of the [EC] Treaty, it shall decide that the measure is compatible with the common market (hereinafter referred to as a “decision not to raise objections”).", "The decision shall specify which exception under the Treaty has been applied.", "4.", "Where the Commission, after a preliminary examination, finds that doubts are raised as to the compatibility with the common market of a notified measure, it shall decide to initiate proceedings pursuant to Article [88(2)] of the [EC] Treaty (hereinafter referred to as a “decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure”).", "… .’", "5 Under Article 6(1) of Regulation No 659/1999:", "‘The decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure shall summarise the relevant issues of fact and law, shall include a preliminary assessment of the Commission as to the aid character of the proposed measure and shall set out the doubts as to its compatibility with the common market.", "The decision shall call upon the Member State concerned and upon other interested parties to submit comments within a prescribed period which shall normally not exceed one month.", "In duly justified cases, the Commission may extend the prescribed period.’", "6 The multisectoral framework on regional aid for large investment projects (OJ 1998 C 107, p. 7; ‘the 1998 multisectoral framework’), which was in force at the material time, lays down the rules for assessing aid which falls within its scope, for the purposes of the application of Article 87(3) EC.", "7 Under the 1998 multisectoral framework, the Commission decides on a case-by-case basis the maximum allowable aid intensity for projects in relation to which the notification obligation laid down in Article 2 of Regulation No 659/1999 arises.", "Background to the dispute", "8 On 9 April 2002, a plan to grant State aid to Zellstoff Stendal GmbH (‘ZSG’) was notified to the Commission by the German authorities.", "9 The planned aid, which consists of a non-refundable loan, a tax incentive for investment and a guarantee covering 80% of a loan and which, according to the Commission, is worth EUR 250.899 million overall, was intended to finance the construction of a production plant for high-quality pulp and to set up a wood supply company and a logistics company in Arneburg, in the Land of Saxony-Anhalt (Germany).", "10 Kronoply and Kronotex are companies governed by German law which manufacture fibreboards (MDF, HDF or LDF) and oriented strand boards at their production sites at Heiligengrabe in the Land of Brandenburg (Germany).", "As in the case of ZSG, the main raw material needed for their activity is wood.", "11 By the contested decision, the Commission decided, following a preliminary examination, not to raise any objections to the planned aid, given the number of direct and indirect jobs created and the fact that there was no overcapacity in that sector.", "Accordingly, without opening a formal investigation under Article 88(2) EC, the Commission found that the planned aid was compatible with the internal market.", "The proceedings at first instance and the judgment under appeal", "12 By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 23 December 2002, Kronoply and Kronotex brought an action for annulment of the contested decision , relying on three pleas in law.", "13 First, Kronoply and Kronotex submitted that, by finding the planned aid in favour of ZSG to be compatible with the internal market, the Commission had made a manifest error in its assessment of the facts.", "14 Secondly, they submitted that, by not opening a formal investigation, the Commission had acted in disregard of the procedural guarantees available to Kronoply and Kronotex under Article 88(2) EC.", "15 Thirdly, according to Kronoply and Kronotex, the Commission had infringed, inter alia, Article 87(1) and (3)(c) EC, as well as the Guidelines on regional aid and the 1998 multi-sectoral framework.", "16 By separate document lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 25 February 2003, the Commission raised two preliminary pleas of inadmissibility, by one of which it alleged that Kronoply and Kronotex had no standing to bring proceedings.", "According to the Commission, Kronoply and Kronotex could not be regarded as competitors of the aid beneficiary and, in consequence, neither company could claim the status of ‘interested party’ for the purposes of Regulation No 659/1999.", "For that reason, Kronoply and Kronotex had no right of action in respect of the contested decision.", "17 By order of 14 June 2005, the General Court decided to reserve its decision on the pleas of inadmissibility for the final judgment.", "18 As regards the question of the standing of Kronoply and Kronotex to bring proceedings, the General Court stated in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal that, under the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC, a natural or legal person may institute proceedings against a decision addressed to another only if the decision is of direct and individual concern to that natural or legal person.", "The General Court also referred to the line of authority flowing from Case 25/62 Plaumann v Commission [1963] ECR 95, according to which persons other than those to whom a decision is addressed may claim to be individually concerned by that decision only if it affects them by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons and, by virtue of those factors, distinguishes them individually just as in the case of the person addressed.", "19 After emphasising, in paragraphs 57 to 59 of the judgment under appeal, the distinction – between the preliminary examination of suspected State aid and the formal investigation procedure for the purposes of Article 88(2) and (3) EC – which characterises the review undertaken by the Commission to determine whether such aid is compatible with the internal market, the General Court went on to recall, in paragraphs 60 and 61 of that judgment, the case-law according to which an action for the annulment of a Commission decision not to open the formal investigation procedure, brought by one of ‘the parties concerned’ for the purposes of Article 88(2) EC, must be held admissible where that party seeks thereby to safeguard the procedural rights available to him under that provision (see, to that effect, Case C‑198/91 Cook v Commission [1993] ECR I‑2487, paragraph 23, and Case C‑225/91 Matra v Commission [1993] ECR I‑3203, paragraph 17).", "In that connection, the General Court stated that the term ‘parties concerned’ must be understood as covering any person, undertaking or association whose interests might be affected by the granting of aid.", "20 After noting in paragraph 62 of the judgment under appeal that, under the case-law, the status of party concerned could provide the basis of standing to bring proceedings, however, only in the context of an action for annulment which is intended to safeguard procedural rights, since the admissibility of an action by means of which the applicant contests the merits of a decision must comply with the conditions set out in the case-law deriving from Plaumann v Commission, the General Court stated in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal that, by their pleas in law, Kronoply and Kronotex were calling in question in Case T‑388/02 both the Commission’s refusal to initiate the formal investigation procedure and the merits of the contested decision.", "21 On that basis, the General Court considered, by reference to the pleas put forward by Kronoply and Kronotex, their standing in relation to the bringing of proceedings.", "22 As regards the question whether Kronoply and Kronotex had standing to challenge the merits of the contested decision, the General Court found in paragraph 69 of the judgment under appeal that Kronoply and Kronotex had not shown that they were individually concerned by that decision.", "The General Court accordingly dismissed as inadmissible the part of their action challenging the merits of the contested decision.", "23 As regards the question whether Kronoply and Kronotex had standing to ensure the respect of their procedural rights, the General Court noted, in paragraphs 71 and 72 of the judgment under appeal, that the status of ‘party concerned’ for the purposes of Article 88(2) EC derives from the legitimate interest that a natural or legal person may have in the implementation, or the non-implementation, of the aid measures.", "Thus, a rival undertaking is regarded as having such an interest if it can show that its competitive situation is affected, or likely to be affected, by the grant of the aid.", "24 After pointing out in paragraphs 73 and 74 of the judgment under appeal that the aid was likely to have an impact not only in the market on which the aid recipient is active, but also on other markets, upstream or downstream, the General Court held, inter alia, in paragraph 76 of that judgment that ‘Kronoply and Kronotex have shown that there has been at least a temporary increase in the price of wood.", "Although they have not shown that that increase can be attributed to the start of operations at ZSG’s factory, it cannot be ruled out that there have been negative effects, of at least temporary duration, for Kronoply and Kronotex subsequent to, and probably as a result of, ZSG’s installation.", "An increase in the price of raw materials – the existence of which is not contested in relation to the year 2003 – is likely to have repercussions for the price of the finished goods and, as a consequence, to weaken the competitiveness of undertakings affected by it as compared with their competitors, who are not faced with the same situation’.", "25 The General Court deduced from this, in paragraph 77 of that judgment, that ‘it must therefore be held that Kronoply and Kronotex have established to the requisite legal standard the existence of a relationship of rivalry, as well as the potential adverse effects on their market position attributable to the grant of the aid at issue.", "In consequence, they must be regarded as parties concerned for the purposes of Article 88(2) EC’.", "26 This led the General Court to find, in paragraph 78 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘[t]he present action is therefore admissible in so far as Kronoply and Kronotex have standing to bring proceedings in order to ensure the respect of their procedural rights.", "In those circumstances, it is for this Court to determine whether, by the pleas relied upon in support of their action, Kronoply and Kronotex are genuinely seeking to ensure that their procedural rights under Article 88(2) EC are respected’.", "27 On that basis, the General Court ruled on the admissibility of the three pleas relied upon by Kronoply and Kronotex in support of their action for annulment, respectively alleging: (i) manifest error of assessment; (ii) disregard for procedural safeguards; and (iii) infringement of Article 87(1) and (3)(c) EC, of the Guidelines on regional aid and of the 1998 multi-sectoral framework.", "28 In so doing, after noting in paragraph 80 of the judgment under appeal that, by their second plea, Kronoply and Kronotex submitted expressly that the Commission should have opened the investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC, the General Court explained in paragraphs 81 and 82 of that judgment that, even though it was not for it, the General Court, to construe the pleas exclusively intended to call in question the merits of a decision as seeking, in reality, to ensure that the applicants’ procedural rights were respected, it could determine whether strands of the substantive arguments on the merits also supported a plea seeking expressly to safeguard procedural rights.", "29 It was on the basis of such strands of argument that the General Court found that the first plea – by contrast with the third – included arguments, going to the merits, which, while intended to contest the Commission’s decision not to open the formal investigation procedure, substantiated the second plea put forward, by which it was sought to ensure that the applicants’ procedural rights were respected.", "30 The General Court concluded in paragraph 86 of the judgment under appeal that the arguments put forward in the context of the first plea had to be taken into account in the examination of the second plea – the third plea being, for its part, inadmissible.", "31 As to the substance, the General Court rejected the arguments put forward by Kronoply and Kronotex.", "32 It thus found, in paragraph 115 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had adopted the contested decision on the basis of complete and reliable evidence, and went on to conclude in paragraphs 117, 128, 146 and 152 of the judgment under appeal that Kronoply and Kronotex had failed to show that, during the preliminary examination of the contested aid measure, the Commission had encountered serious difficulties necessitating the initiation of the formal investigation procedure.", "33 The General Court consequently dismissed the action for annulment in its entirety .", "Forms of order sought by the parties", "34 By its appeal, the Commission claims that the Court should:", "– set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it declares the action brought by Kronoply and Kronotex for annulment of the contested decision to be admissible;", "– dismiss as inadmissible the action brought by Kronoply and Kronotex for annulment of the contested decision;", "– order Kronoply and Kronotex to pay the costs of the appeal.", "35 ZSG contends that the Court should:", "– set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it declares the action brought by Kronoply and Kronotex for annulment of the contested decision to be admissible;", "– dismiss as inadmissible the action brought by Kronoply and Kronotex for annulment of the contested decision;", "– order Kronoply et Kronotex jointly and severally to pay the costs.", "The appeal", "36 The Commission, supported by ZSG, relies on three grounds of appeal on the basis of which it challenges the judgment under appeal in so far as it declared the action brought by Kronoply and Kronotex to be admissible.", "The first and second grounds of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "37 First, the Commission submits, in essence, that the General Court erred in holding the action brought by Kronoply and Kronotex to be admissible on the basis of conditions other than those laid down in the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC.", "In that regard, according to the Commission, the case-law on which the General Court relied lays down, drawing on Article 108 TFEU, alternative conditions for admissibility.", "38 Since, however, in the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC, the authors of the Treaty set out in express terms the conditions for the admissibility of actions contesting acts of the institutions, it cannot be maintained – the Commission argues – that the same authors intended to derogate from those conditions by means of an inference to be drawn by implication from Article 108 TFEU.", "39 ZSG adds that the conditions for the admissibility of an action seeking annulment of a Commission decision cannot vary depending on the pleas relied upon in support of that action.", "40 Secondly, the Commission – supported on this point by ZSG – submits that, after stating in paragraph 81 of the judgment under appeal that it was not for it, the General Court, to construe ‘an action by which the applicant contests exclusively the merits of a decision assessing aid as such as an action which is seeking, in reality, to ensure the respect of the applicant’s procedural rights under Article 88(2) EC, where the applicant has not expressly raised a plea to that effect’, the General Court went on to adopt precisely such an interpretation in paragraph 82 of that judgment.", "41 However, according to the Commission, in so doing, the General Court exceeded its jurisdiction, since it must remain within the terms of the action as delimited by the pleadings lodged before it.", "Furthermore, such an approach would ultimately dismantle the equality of the parties before the Court of the European Union, favouring the position of the applicants to the detriment of that of the Commission.", "42 ZSG argues that, by proceeding in that manner, the General Court anticipated, wrongly, the assessment that the Commission is required to make of the file during the formal investigation procedure, despite the fact that, at the preliminary stage, the planned aid did not undergo a detailed examination.", "Findings of the Court", "43", "In the first place, as regards the plea alleging breach of the conditions laid down in the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC, it should be made clear at the outset that Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999 provides for a stage at which the aid measures notified undergo a preliminary examination, the purpose of which is to enable the Commission to form an initial view as to whether the aid notified is compatible with the common market.", "On completion of that stage, the Commission is to make a finding either that the measure does not constitute aid or that it falls within the scope of Article 87(1) EC.", "In the latter case, it may be that the measure does not raise doubts as to its compatibility with the common market; on the other hand, it is also possible that the measure may raise such doubts.", "44", "If, following the preliminary examination, the Commission finds that, notwithstanding the fact that the measure notified falls within the scope of Article 87(1) EC, it does not raise any doubts as to its compatibility with the common market, the Commission is to adopt a decision not to raise objections under Article 4(3) of Regulation No 659/1999.", "45", "Where the Commission adopts a decision not to raise objections, it declares not only that the measure is compatible with the common market, but also – by implication – that it refuses to initiate the formal investigation procedure laid down in Article 88(2) EC and Article 6(1) of Regulation No 659/1999.", "46", "If, following the preliminary examination, it finds that the measure notified raises doubts as to its compatibility with the common market, the Commission is required to adopt, on the basis of Article 4(4) of Regulation No 659/1999, a decision initiating the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC and Article 6(1) of that regulation.", "Under the latter provision, such a decision is to call upon the Member State concerned and upon other interested parties to submit comments within a prescribed period which must not as a rule exceed one month.", "47", "In the present case, the contested decision is a decision not to raise objections, adopted under Article 4(3) of Regulation No 659/1999, the lawfulness of which depends on whether there are doubts as to the compatibility of the aid with the common market.", "Since such doubts must trigger the initiation of a formal investigation procedure in which the interested parties referred to in Article 1(h) of Regulation No 659/1999 can participate, it must be held that any interested party within the meaning of the latter provision is directly and individually concerned by such a decision.", "If the beneficiaries of the procedural guarantees provided for in Article 88(2) EC and Article 6(1) of Regulation No 659/1999 are to be able to ensure that those guarantees are respected, it must be possible for them to challenge before the European Union judicature the decision not to raise objections (see, to that effect, Case C‑78/03 P Commission v Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum [2005] ECR I‑10737, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited; Case C‑487/06 P British Aggregates v Commission [2008] ECR I‑10515, paragraph 28; and Case C‑319/07 P 3F v Commission [2009] ECR I‑5963, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited).", "48", "Accordingly, the specific status of ‘interested party’ within the meaning of Article 1(h) of Regulation No 659/1999, in conjunction with the specific subject-matter of the action, is sufficient to distinguish individually, for the purposes of the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC, the applicant contesting a decision not to raise objections.", "49", "In the present case, first, it emerges from the judgment under appeal and, in particular, from paragraph 16 of that judgment that, by their action, Kronoply and Kronotex sought the annulment of a decision not to raise objections, adopted under Article 4(3) of Regulation No 659/1999.", "Secondly, in paragraph 77 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found, in essence, that Kronoply and Kronotex had to be regarded as interested parties within the meaning of Article 1(h) of Regulation No 659/1999.", "50", "In the second place, the Commission and ZSG claim that the General Court altered the subject-matter of the action in so far as it examined, in the context of the second plea alleging disregard for the interested parties’ procedural guarantees, the arguments raised in the context of the first plea, contesting the merits of the decision not to raise objections.", "51", "In that regard, although an applicant who contests a Commission decision not to initiate the formal investigation procedure must, in accordance with Article 44(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, define the subject-matter of its action in the application initiating proceedings, that requirement is satisfied to the requisite legal standard where the applicant identifies the decision which he seeks to have annulled.", "52", "It matters little whether the application initiating proceedings states that it is seeking the annulment of ‘a decision not to raise objections’ – the term used in Article 4(3) of Regulation No 659/1999 – or of a decision not to initiate the formal investigation procedure, since the Commission takes a position on both aspects of the question by means of a single decision.", "53", "In the present case, it should be noted that, at first instance, Kronoply and Kronotex requested annulment of the Commission decision ‘not to raise an objection to the grant of aid by the Federal Republic of Germany’ to ZSG, invoking three pleas in law in support of their action.", "54", "In that regard, the General Court found in paragraph 80 of the judgment under appeal that it was solely by their second plea that Kronoply and Kronotex expressly submitted that the Commission should have opened the formal investigation procedure.", "55", "With regard to the first and third pleas, the General Court thus rightly pointed out in paragraph 81 of the judgment under appeal that, according to settled case-law, it was not for it, the General Court, to interpret an action challenging exclusively the merits of an aid assessment decision as such as seeking, in reality, to ensure the respect of the procedural rights available to the applicant under Article 88(2) EC, where the applicant has not expressly raised a plea to that effect.", "In such circumstances, the interpretation of the plea would be tantamount to re-defining the subject-matter of the action (see, to that effect, the judgment of 29 November 2007 in Case C‑176/06 P Stadtwerke Schwäbisch Hall and Others v Commission, paragraph 25).", "56", "In paragraph 82 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court nevertheless held that that limit on its jurisdiction to construe pleas in law does not have the effect of preventing it from examining arguments which the applicant has put forward regarding the substance, in order to ascertain whether strands of those arguments additionally support a plea, also raised by the applicant, which expressly alleges the existence of serious difficulties justifying initiation of the procedure under Article 88(2) EC.", "57", "Consequently, the General Court held in paragraph 83 of the judgment under appeal that it was entitled to examine the first and third pleas, in order to ascertain whether the arguments put forward in the context of those pleas could be linked to the plea alleging disregard for procedural guarantees.", "In that context, the General Court held in paragraph 86 of that judgment that the arguments relied upon in support of the first plea, in so far as they were intended to challenge the Commission’s decision not to initiate the formal investigation procedure, had to be examined at the same time as the arguments put forward in support of the second plea.", "58", "In so doing, however, the General Court did not err in law.", "59", "Where an applicant seeks the annulment of a decision not to raise objections, it essentially contests the fact that the Commission adopted the decision in relation to the aid at issue without initiating the formal investigation procedure, alleging that the Commission thereby acted in breach of the applicant’s procedural rights.", "In order to have its action for annulment upheld, the applicant may invoke any plea to show that the assessment of the information and evidence which the Commission had at its disposal during the preliminary examination phase of the measure notified should have raised doubts as to the compatibility of that measure with the common market.", "The use of such arguments does nothing, however, to bring about a change in the subject-matter of the action or in the conditions for its admissibility (see, to that effect, 3F v Commission, paragraph 35).", "On the contrary, the existence of doubts concerning that compatibility is precisely the evidence which must be adduced in order to show that the Commission was required to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC and Article 6(1) of Regulation No 659/1999.", "60", "In those circumstances, the first and second grounds of appeal must be rejected in their entirety.", "The third ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "61 According to the Commission, by considering it possible for undertakings which are not competitors of the aid recipient on the market for the product which they manufacture to have the status of ‘parties concerned’ for the purposes of Article 88(2) EC, the General Court erred in law.", "In so doing, the General Court is opening the way for actions to be brought by members of the general public against Commission decisions in the field of State aid.", "Accordingly, the Commission argues, in the circumstances of the present case, the General Court wrongly attributed to Kronoply and Kronotex an interest in having the contested decision annulled.", "62 In that regard, ZSG claims also that the effect of the reasoning followed by the General Court is to widen disproportionately the circle of undertakings likely to challenge a decision in the field of State aid.", "Although ZSG uses mainly wood pulp in its business, it also uses other materials and energy sources for its manufacturing process.", "Accordingly, the effect of the judgment under appeal is that an unlimited number of potential applicants are recognised as interested parties.", "Findings of the Court", "63", "Under Article 1(h) of Regulation No 659/1999, ‘interested party’ means inter alia any person, undertaking or association of undertakings whose interests might be affected by the granting of aid, that is to say, in particular competing undertakings of the beneficiary of that aid.", "In other words, that term covers an indeterminate group of persons (see, to that effect, Case 323/82 Intermills v Commission [1984] ECR 3809, paragraph 16).", "64", "As a consequence, that provision does not rule out the possibility that an undertaking which is not a direct competitor of the beneficiary of the aid, but which requires the same raw material for its production process, can be categorised as an interested party, provided that that undertaking demonstrates that its interests could be adversely affected by the grant of the aid.", "65", "For that purpose, it is necessary for that undertaking to establish, to the requisite legal standard, that the aid is likely to have a specific effect on its situation (see, to that effect, 3F v Commission, paragraph 33).", "66", "In the present case, after noting in paragraph 71 of the judgment under appeal that, for a natural or legal person to be recognised as an interested party, that person must be able to show a legitimate interest in the implementation or non-implementation of the aid measures at issue or, if those measures have already been granted, in their maintenance, the General Court stated that, in the case of an undertaking, such a legitimate interest may consist, inter alia, in the protection of its competitive position, in so far as that position would be adversely affected by the aid measures.", "67", "After finding in paragraphs 74 and 75 of the judgment under appeal that Kronoply and Kronotex are not competitors on the same product markets, but use the same raw materials – namely, industrial wood – in their production process, the General Court inferred from this that Kronoply and Kronotex are, in relation to ZSG, rival purchasers of wood.", "68", "Subsequently, the General Court found in paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal that Kronoply and Kronotex had demonstrated that there had been at least a temporary increase in the price of wood and that, despite the fact that they had not demonstrated that that increase was the result of the entry into operation of the ZSG factory, it could not be ruled out that there had been negative effects for Kronoply and Kronotex, probably as a result of ZSG’s installation.", "69", "On that basis, the General Court held in paragraph 77 of that judgment that Kronoply and Kronotex had ‘established to the requisite legal standard the existence of a relationship of rivalry, as well as the potential adverse effects on their market position, attributable to the grant of the aid at issue’.", "70", "In those circumstances, an error of law cannot be imputed to the General Court for holding, in essence, that undertakings which are not competitors of the aid recipient on the market for the goods which they manufacture can be covered by the notion of ‘interested parties’ within the meaning of Article 1(h) of Regulation No 659/1999.", "71", "It follows from those considerations that the General Court was correct in holding that Kronoply and Kronotex were interested parties within the meaning of that provision.", "72", "Consequently, the third ground of appeal must be rejected.", "73 It follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.", "Costs", "74 Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, which

"Judgment", "1", "By its appeal, DTS Distribuidora de Televisión Digital SA (‘DTS’) seeks to have set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 11 July 2014, DTS Distribuidora de Televisión Digital v Commission (T‑533/10, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2014:629), by which the General Court dismissed its application for annulment of Commission Decision 2011/1/EU of 20 July 2010 on the State aid scheme C 38/09 (ex NN 58/09) which Spain is planning to implement for Corporación de Radio y Televisión Española (RTVE) (OJ 2011 L 1, p. 9) (‘the contested decision’).", "Background to the dispute", "2", "DTS is a company specialising in the management and operation, on the Spanish market, of a digital satellite pay-TV service, known as Digital +, and in the development of special-interest channels.", "3", "Corporación de Radio y Televisión Española SA (‘RTVE’), is the Spanish public radio and television broadcasting organisation which has been entrusted with a public service mandate in those fields by Ley 17/2006 de la radio y la televisión de titularidad estatal (Law No 17/2006 on State-owned radio and television) of 5 June 2006 (BOE No 134 of 6 June 2006, p. 21270).", "4", "Law No 17/2006 provided for a dual funding scheme: RTVE received revenue from its commercial activities, in particular the sale of advertising space, and payments from the Spanish State as compensation for the fulfilment of its public service mandate.", "5", "The European Commission approved that system of financing by Decisions C(2005) 1163 final of 20 April 2005 on State aid to RTVE (E 8/05) (summarised in OJ 2006 C 239, p. 17) and C(2007) 641 final of 7 March 2007 on the funding of measures to reduce staff numbers at RTVE (NN 8/07) (summarised in OJ 2007 C 109, p. 2).", "6", "That funding system was altered by Ley 8/2009 de financiación de la Corporación de Radio y Televisión Española (Law No 8/2009 on the funding of RTVE) of 28 August 2009 (BOE No 210 of 31 August 2009, p. 74003).", "That law came into force on 1 September 2009.", "7", "First of all, Law No 8/2009 provided that, as from the end of 2009, advertising, teleshopping, sponsorship and pay-per-view services would no longer be sources of funding for RTVE.", "The only commercial revenue that would continue to be available to RTVE after that date would be the income which it derived from the provision of services to third parties and from the sale of its own productions.", "That revenue amounted to approximately EUR 25 million.", "8", "Next, in order to offset the loss of other commercial revenue, Law No 8/2009 introduced or amended, in Article 2(1)(b) to (d) and Articles 4 to 6 thereof, a number of fiscal measures (‘the fiscal measures at issue’), including a new tax of 1.5% on the revenues of pay-television operators established in Spain (‘the tax on pay-television operators’).", "The contribution of that tax to RTVE’s budget was limited to 20% of the total annual support for RTVE, any surplus tax revenue being paid into the general budget of the State.", "That law also provided, inter alia, for a new tax on the revenues of telecommunications services operators established in Spain.", "9", "Furthermore, the compensation for the fulfilment of the public service obligations provided for in Law No 17/2006 was maintained.", "Thus, in the event that the funding sources mentioned above should prove insufficient to cover the whole of RTVE’s costs of fulfilling those obligations, the State was required, under Article 2(2) of Law No 8/2009 and Article 33 of Law No 17/2006, to make good the shortfall, thus transforming RTVE’s dual funding scheme into an almost entirely publicly funded scheme.", "10", "Finally, Article 3(2) of Law No 8/2009 established a ceiling for RTVE’s income.", "In 2010 and 2011, its total income was limited to EUR 1200 million per annum, which also corresponded to its maximum expenditure in each of those financial years.", "The maximum increase in that amount was set at 1% for the three years 2012 to 2014 and, for subsequent years, the increase was to be based on the annual consumer price index.", "11", "After receiving, on 22 June 2009, a complaint drawing attention to the bill which was to become Law No 8/2009, the Commission notified the Kingdom of Spain on 2 December 2009 that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 108(2) TFEU in respect of the change to RTVE’s funding scheme (summarised in OJ 2010 C 8, p. 31).", "12", "On 18 March 2010, the Commission commenced proceedings for failure to fulfil obligations under Article 258 TFEU, on the ground that the tax on the revenues of telecommunications services operators established in Spain was contrary to Article 12 of Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (OJ 2002 L 108, p. 21).", "On 30 September 2010, in a reasoned opinion, the Commission requested the Kingdom of Spain to abolish the tax on the ground of its incompatibility with that directive.", "13", "On 20 July 2010, the Commission adopted the contested decision, in which it declared that the alteration of RTVE’s funding scheme brought about by Law No 8/2009 was compatible with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU.", "In that context, the Commission considered, in particular, that the fiscal measures at issue were not an integral part of the new items of aid provided for by that law and that any incompatibility of those fiscal measures with Directive 2002/20 therefore did not affect the assessment of the funding scheme’s compatibility with the internal market.", "In addition, it took the view that RTVE’s amended funding scheme was consistent with Article 106(2) TFEU, since it complied with the principle of proportionality.", "The judgment under appeal", "14", "By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 24 November 2010, DTS brought an action for annulment of the contested decision.", "In support of that application, DTS put forward three pleas in law, alleging, respectively, failure to have regard to the concept of ‘aid’ within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU as regards the inseparability of the fiscal measures at issue; infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU; and infringement of Articles 49 and 63 TFEU.", "15", "By the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected each of the pleas on the substance and, accordingly, dismissed the action in its entirety .", "Procedure before the Court and forms of order sought", "16", "By its appeal, DTS, supported by Telefónica de España SA and Telefónica Móviles España SA (together, ‘the Telefónica companies’) requests the Court to:", "—", "set aside the judgment under appeal;", "—", "annul the contested decision or, in the alternative, refer the case back to the General Court; and", "—", "order the Commission and the other parties to pay the costs incurred before the Court of Justice and the General Court.", "17", "The Commission requests the Court to dismiss the appeal and to order DTS to pay the costs.", "The Kingdom of Spain and RTVE claim, primarily, that the appeal is inadmissible and, subsidiarily, ask the Court to reject it as unfounded.", "18", "The Telefónica companies brought a cross-appeal, claiming that the Court should set aside the judgment under appeal and order the Commission and the interveners which support it to pay the costs incurred before the Court of Justice and the General Court.", "RTVE, the Kingdom of Spain and the Commission contend that the Court should dismiss that cross-appeal.", "The main appeal", "19", "In support of its appeal, DTS, after having stated that, by its appeal, it only criticises the General Court for having held that, in the judgment under appeal, the Commission correctly held in the contested decision that it was not required to assess the compatibility with the FEU Treaty of the tax on pay-television operators, relies on three grounds of appeal.", "20", "The first ground of appeal is based on infringement of Article 107(1) TFEU on account of an incorrect interpretation of the concept of aid.", "The second ground of appeal rests on infringement of that provision, in that the General Court did not, in the judgment under appeal, undertake a full review of the existence of aid and distorted Spanish law.", "The third ground of appeal rests on an error of law in the application of Article 106(2) TFEU.", "Admissibility of the appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "21", "RTVE submits that the appeal, taken as a whole, is inadmissible since, at 40 pages, it significantly exceeds the maximum length of 25 pages authorised by the Practice directions to parties concerning cases brought before the Court (OJ 2014 L 31, p. 1, ‘the practice directions’), without DTS explaining the need to do so.", "22", "Furthermore, RTVE and the Kingdom of Spain contend that the appeal does not precisely identify the paragraphs of the judgment under appeal which are disputed.", "In their submission, the appeal thus merely repeats the arguments put forward at first instance.", "23", "DTS submits that its appeal is admissible.", "Findings of the Court", "24", "First of all, it should be noted that the Practice directions to parties are indicative and have no binding force.", "As is apparent from recitals 1 to 3 of those directions, they were adopted in order to supplement and clarify the rules applicable to the conduct of proceedings before the Court, in the interest of the proper administration of justice, and are not intended to replace the relevant provisions of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Rules of Procedure of the Court (see, to that effect, order of the President of the Court of 30 April 2010, Ziegler v Commission, C‑113/09 P(R), not published, EU:C:2010:242, paragraph 33).", "25", "It is therefore clearly apparent from the wording of paragraph 20 of those practice directions, which state that ‘the appeal …, unless there are special circumstances, should not exceed 25 pages’, that that recital does not set out an absolute limitation on the number of pages to which the admissibility of such an appeal is subject, but that it merely provides a recommendation in that regard to the parties.", "26", "It follows that the appeal may not be rejected as inadmissible on the ground that it exceeds a certain number of pages.", "27", "Secondly, it should be noted that, according to the second subparagraph of Article 256(1) TFEU, the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 168(1)(d) of the Rules of Procedure, an appeal must, on penalty of being deemed inadmissible, indicate precisely the contested elements of the judgment which the appellant seeks to have set aside and the legal arguments specifically advanced in support of the appeal, failing which the appeal or the ground of appeal in question will be dismissed as inadmissible (see, inter alia, judgment of 10 July 2014, Telefónica and Telefónica de España v Commission, C‑295/12 P, EU:C:2014:2062, paragraph 29 and the case-law cited).", "28", "Moreover, it follows from those same provisions that an appeal is inadmissible in so far as it merely repeats the pleas in law and arguments previously submitted to the General Court, including those based on facts expressly rejected by it.", "Such an appeal amounts in reality to no more than a request for re-examination of the application submitted to the General Court, which the Court of Justice does not have jurisdiction to undertake on appeal (see judgment of 30 May 2013, Quinn Barlo and Others v Commission, C‑70/12 P, not published, EU:C:2013:351, paragraph 26 and the case-law cited).", "29", "By contrast, provided that the appellant challenges the interpretation or application of EU law by the General Court, the points of law examined at first instance may be discussed again in the course of an appeal.", "Indeed, if an appellant could not thus base his appeal on pleas in law and arguments already relied on before the General Court, an appeal would be deprived of part of its purpose (see judgment of 30 May 2013, Quinn Barlo and Others v Commission, C‑70/12 P, not published, EU:C:2013:351, paragraph 27 and the case-law cited).", "30", "In the present case, it should be noted that it is apparent from the review of the appeal that DTS has set out clearly and precisely the paragraphs of the judgment under appeal referred to in its grounds of appeal, as well as the reasons why that judgment, in its submission, is vitiated by errors of law.", "31", "Moreover, contrary to what RTVE and the Kingdom of Spain submit, DTS does not merely repeat, in its appeal, the arguments made at first instance.", "It disputes, in fact, for the most part, the manner in which the General Court interpreted and applied EU law, in particular Article 107(1) TFEU, in holding, in the judgment under appeal, that the tax on pay-television operators for which it is liable is not an integral part of the aid granted to RTVE and, for the remainder, it accuses the General Court of having distorted the law and, accordingly, vitiated that judgment.", "32", "Accordingly, the appeal must be held to be admissible.", "33", "It is appropriate therefore, to assess the merits thereof, by examining, first, the second ground of appeal, followed by the first and third grounds.", "The second ground of appeal, alleging infringement of Article 107(1) TFEU in that the General Court failed to carry out a comprehensive review into the existence of aid and distorted Spanish law", "Arguments of the parties", "34", "DTS and the Telefónica companies submit that the Court did not carry out a full review of the Commission’s assessments as regards the conditions laid down in paragraphs 106 to 111 of the judgment of 22 December 2008, Régie Networks (C‑333/07, EU:C:2008:764).", "The General Court is alleged not to have assessed the extent to which the projected amount of the revenue impacted on the calculation of the aid, distorting in that regard, in paragraphs 65 to 70 of the judgment under appeal, the national law provisions on which that Court relied in order to reach the conclusion that the amount levied in respect of the tax on pay-television operators did not influence the amount of the aid to RTVE, while failing to take account of other relevant provisions of that law.", "35", "First, DTS claims that, contrary to the General Court’s finding in paragraph 69 of that judgment, Article 2(2) of Law No 8/2009 does not require the State, where the revenue available to RTVE is insufficient to cover the net costs of fulfilling its public service mandate, to provide resources from its general budget in order to cover those objectively determined costs.", "On the one hand, that provision would require the State to supplement the ‘budget forecasts’ for RTVE where, in implementing it, the amount of the tax revenue is below the budget forecasts.", "On the other hand, contributions from the general budget of the State are authorised only where expenditure exceeds the budget forecasts.", "36", "Furthermore, Article 2(2) of Law No 8/2009 should be read in conjunction with Article 34 of Law No 17/2006 and Article 44 of the Mandato-marco a la Corporación RTVE previsto en el artículo 4 de la Ley 17/2006 de la radio y la televisión de titularidad estatal, aprobado por los plenos del congreso de los diputados y del senado (framework mandate assigned to RTVE, provided for in Article 4 of Law No 17/2006, approved in plenary sitting by the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate) (BOE No 157 of 30 June 2008, p. 28833).", "37", "It is apparent from those provisions, which were not taken into account by the General Court, that RTVE itself is to set its budget, taking account not only of the projected costs of the public service obligations but also the projected revenue, including the revenue from the fiscal measures at issue.", "Consequently, in the event that the actual revenue from those measures is below the projected amount of the taxes and does not enable the cost of the public service budgeted for by RTVE to be covered, the State is required to supplement the ‘projected budget’ by means of contributions from its general budget.", "However, the ‘projected budget’ should be set on the basis of the projected amount of revenue from, in particular, the tax on pay-television operators and, consequently, that amount has a direct impact on the amount of the aid.", "The impact of the revenue from that tax on the implementation of the budget is therefore not to be confused with the impact of the projected amount of the revenue from that tax on the initial setting of that budget and, accordingly, on the amount of the aid.", "38", "The Telefónica companies further submit that there are clear indications that contradict the possibility of an alleged additional contribution from the general budget of the State; the grounds of Law No 8/2009 state, for example, that ‘it does not seem reasonable that the funding guarantee should entail an increase in the contribution of the State’.", "Furthermore, that possibility falls within a subsidiary premiss.", "Under Article 2(2) of Law No 8/2009, two conditions must be met for the State to finance part of the costs of the public service obligation.", "First, for a given year, the revenue from the tax on pay-television operators must be lower than the costs of carrying out the public service mandate and, secondly, the amount of the reserve fund must be insufficient to cover RTVE’s costs for that year.", "The fact that that provision establishes a State guarantee limited in that manner, which constitutes a new aid, does not preclude the aid granted to RTVE being established on the basis of the revenue from that tax or preclude the State undertaking to make good the shortfall where the revenue from the tax is not sufficient.", "39", "Secondly, DTS alleges that the General Court distorted, in paragraphs 66 to 68 of the judgment under appeal, Article 33 of Law No 17/2006 and Article 8 of Law No 8/2009, relating to the role of the State where revenues from the tax on pay-television operators exceed the net costs of the public service.", "On the one hand, the fact that RTVE’s revenue is subject to an absolute cap is irrelevant, since it is important to determine whether, subject to that cap, the amount of the aid is based on expected revenues from that tax.", "On the other hand, the General Court merely asserted that it is apparent from Article 8(3) of Law No 8/2009 that the excess paid to the reserve fund can be used by RTVE only with the express authorisation of the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, omitting the opening words of that provision, which state that ‘the fund may be used only to offset the losses in previous years and to deal with unforeseen situations in connection with the supply of the public service’.", "The amount of those additional resources necessarily depends on the revenue from the taxes, since that fund is financed by those taxes.", "40", "The Telefónica companies submit, moreover, that the General Court misinterpreted Article 33(1) of Law No 17/2006 and Article 3(2) of Law No 8/2009 in finding that those provisions remove any link between the amount of the aid and the amount of the levies imposed on the basis of the fiscal measures at issue.", "The fact that the revenue may be paid to the general budget of the Spanish State is merely a subsidiary premiss.", "Only the revenue in excess of the limit of 10% of RTVE’s annual costs is paid to the Public Treasury.", "Furthermore, it does not follow that the amount of the aid is independent of the amount of the tax revenue.", "Article 33(1) of Law No 17/2006 at most places a restriction on the amount of the aid, which does not prevent the total revenue from the tax being converted into aid within the limit set by the national legislature.", "41", "The Telefónica companies state that it is further apparent from various items of evidence that the State is not willing to supplement RTVE’s budget.", "While those items of evidence are subsequent to the contested decision, they confirm the terms of the preparatory acts to Law No 8/2009, according to which ‘it does not seem reasonable that the funding guarantee should entail an increase in the contribution of the State’.", "42", "RTVE, the Kingdom of Spain and the Commission submit that the second plea is inadmissible and, in any event, wholly unfounded", "Findings of the Court", "43", "It should be noted that the Court of Justice has consistently held that where the General Court has established or assessed the facts, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction, under Article 256 TFEU, solely to review the legal characterisation of those facts and the conclusions in law drawn from them.", "The appraisal of the facts by the General Court does not therefore constitute, save where the clear sense of the evidence produced before it is distorted, a question of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice (see, inter alia, judgment of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 78).", "44", "Thus, with respect to the assessment, in the context of an appeal, of the General Court’s determinations on national law, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction only to determine whether that law was distorted (see judgment of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 79 and the case-law cited).", "45", "In that regard, it should be noted that distortion must be obvious from the documents on the Court’s file, without there being any need to carry out a new assessment of the facts and the evidence (judgment of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 80).", "46", "In the present case, it should be recalled that in paragraphs 65 to 86 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court concluded, in the light of the terms of Law No 8/2009, that, as noted by the Commission, in its view, correctly, the amount of the aid to be given to RTVE does not depend on the amount of the tax levy imposed on DTS, since the amount of the aid is fixed by reference to the net costs of fulfilling RTVE’s public service mandate.", "47", "In that regard, the General Court, on the one hand, observed in paragraph 66 of that judgment that, under Article 33 of Law No 17/2006, in the event that the income available to RTVE exceeds the costs of fulfilling its public service broadcasting mandate, the surplus is to be reallocated, in so far as it does not exceed 10% of RTVE’s budgeted annual costs, to a reserve fund or the treasury.", "As regards the first of those situations, the General Court stated, in paragraph 67 of that judgment, that it is apparent from Article 8 of Law No 8/2009 that the capital may be used only with the express authorisation of the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and that, if it is not used within four years, it must be used to reduce the compensation to be drawn from the general budget of the Spanish State.", "Moreover, the General Court noted, in paragraph 68 of the same judgment, that Article 3(2) of Law No 8/2009 lays down an absolute limit on RTVE’s income, which is set at EUR 1200 million for 2010 and 2011 and that any surplus over and above that ceiling is to be directly re-allocated to the general budget of the Spanish State.", "48", "In the second place, in paragraphs 69, 76 and 80 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that, under Article 2(2) of Law No 8/2009, in the event that the income available to RTVE is insufficient to cover the costs of fulfilling its public service broadcasting mandate, the Spanish State is required to cover the shortfall by means of contributions from its general budget.", "49", "In the present case, it is clear that, under the cloak of criticising the General Court for having erred in law when conducting a judicial review of the contested decision and distorted the national law provisions, while having failed to take others into consideration, DTS and the Telefónica companies are actually merely criticising the General Court’s interpretation of national law in paragraphs 65 to 86 of the judgment under appeal.", "Their purpose is thus to substitute an alternative interpretation thereto and, accordingly, to obtain, by relying, in particular, on national provisions whose merits were not considered at first instance, a new assessment of the facts and evidence.", "They are not seeking to show that the General Court made findings manifestly conflicting with that national legislation or that, in relation to the items in the file, it should have given that legislation a scope which it clearly does not have.", "50", "In those circumstances, the second ground of appeal must be rejected as being inadmissible.", "The first ground of appeal, alleging infringement of Article 107(1) TFEU owing to an incorrect interpretation of the concept of aid", "The first part, alleging that the link between the tax on pay-television operators and the aid granted to RTVE is not comparable to that between a tax of general application and exemption therefrom", "– Arguments of the parties", "51", "DTS submits that the General Court erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 92 and 93 of the judgment under appeal, that it was seeking, by its appeal, to call into question the case-law of the Court of Justice resulting from the judgment of 20 September 2001, Banks (C‑390/98, EU:C:2001:456).", "That case-law related only to the situation in which certain categories of undertakings are exempt from a tax of general application.", "In the present case, DTS does not object to the levying of the tax on pay-television operators on the ground that RTVE enjoys an exemption which constitutes State aid.", "It does claim, however, that that tax, since it was imposed on it asymmetrically in order to fund directly the aid scheme for RTVE, is itself an aid, like the tax at issue in the case which gave rise to the judgment of 7 September 2006, Laboratoires Boiron (C‑526/04, ‘the Laboratoires Boiron judgment’, EU:C:2006:528).", "52", "RTVE and the Commission contend that this part of the ground of appeal is ineffective and, in any event, unfounded, a position also adopted by the Kingdom of Spain.", "– Findings of the Court", "53", "It should be recalled that, in paragraphs 92 and 93 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found that, by its arguments alleging infringement of Article 107(1) TFEU because of the relationship between the fiscal measures at issue and the competitive advantage enjoyed by RTVE, DTS was seeking to call into question the principle derived from the case-law of the Court, enshrined in paragraph 80 of the judgment of 20 September 2001, Banks (C‑390/98, EU:C:2001:456), to the effect that persons liable to pay an obligatory contribution cannot rely on the argument that the exemption enjoyed by other persons constitutes State aid in order to avoid payment of that contribution .", "54", "The complaint made by DTS with regard to those findings in the context of the first part of the first ground of appeal is incapable of leading to the judgment under appeal being set aside, since, as correctly argued by RTVE and the Commission, the General Court rejected DTS’s submissions in that respect for the reasons set out not in paragraphs 92 and 93 of that judgment, but in paragraphs 94 to 105 thereof, relating to the relevance of the Laboratoires Boiron judgment for examination of the aid at issue, which grounds of appeal are the subject of the second part of the present plea.", "55", "Consequently, the first part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected as being ineffective.", "The second part, alleging that the tax on pay-television operators is an asymmetrical tax constituting an aid within the meaning of the Laboratoires Boiron judgment", "– Arguments of the parties", "56", "First, DTS claims that the tax on pay-television operators is an integral part of the aid granted to RTVE since it constitutes an asymmetrical tax which may be assimilated to that at issue in the Laboratoires Boiron judgment.", "That tax is imposed on a single category of operators, namely pay-television operators, which are in competition with RTVE.", "The aid is the consequence of the fact that, on the one hand, a competitor of the beneficiary of the aid is subject to a tax and, on the other, that the revenue generated by the tax is allocated to the funding of the aid.", "57", "Secondly, DTS submits that the differences identified by the General Court between the tax on pay-television operators and the tax examined in the Laboratoires Boiron judgment are irrelevant.", "58", "First of all, the fact, noted by the General Court in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, that the main objective of the tax on pay-television operators is not to restore the balance of competition between RTVE and other operators is not a decisive factor.", "The concept of aid is an objective notion.", "In any event, the purpose of that tax is analogous to that of the tax at issue in the case giving rise to the Laboratoires Boiron judgment, since its purpose is to contribute to the financing of the costs incurred by RTVE in fulfilling its public service mandate.", "59", "Secondly, it is not correct to consider, as the General Court did in paragraph 101 of the judgment under appeal, that the link between the tax on pay-television operators and the aid is less narrow than the one identified in the Laboratoires Boiron judgment.", "In that regard, the General Court was wrong to find that any incompatibility of that tax with EU law would not directly call into question the aid granted to RTVE.", "The judgment under appeal fails to take into account that the obligation for DTS to help finance a competitor reinforces the distortion of competition resulting from the transfer of funds to the latter.", "RTVE thus enjoys a competitive advantage in the markets for the acquisition of audiovisual content, not only because of the funds it receives for the fulfillment of its public service mandate, but also because those funds do not benefit its competitors.", "The latter advantage would disappear completely if the tax on pay-television operators were abolished.", "60", "Thirdly, the General Court incorrectly held, in paragraphs 102 to 104 of the judgment under appeal, that, unlike the situation at issue in the case giving rise to the Laboratoires Boiron judgment, the amount of the aid granted to RTVE is not determined by the amount of the tax on pay-television operators.", "In the present case, the competitive advantage enjoyed by RTVE increases with the amount of that tax imposed on DTS, since, the greater that tax, the less resources it will have to compete with RTVE.", "The link between that tax and the aid is thus narrower than that identified in the Laboratoires Boiron judgment.", "In the contested decision, the Commission arrived at the conclusion that the transfer of public funds to RTVE constitutes State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "61", "The Telefónica companies submit, first of all, that the General Court erred in law in interpreting restrictively the conditions that must be satisfied in order for the method of financing of an aid to form an integral part of that aid, since the rules should be given a teleological interpretation.", "62", "Second, the Telefónica companies argue that the conditions laid down by the case-law of the Court of Justice for the purpose of establishing that a fiscal measure is part of an aid, namely the hypothecation of the tax to the funding of the aid in question and the direct impact of the revenue from the tax on the amount of the aid, are not separate and cumulative conditions.", "The hypothecation itself implies the existence of a necessary link between the amount of revenue and the aid.", "The General Court thus misinterpreted the judgment of 13 January 2005, Streekgewest (C‑174/02, EU:C:2005:10), since, in that judgment, the Court examined only whether the tax was necessarily hypothecated to the aid under the relevant national rules and considered that, if so, the direct impact of the fiscal measure on the amount of the aid was a logical consequence.", "63", "Thirdly, the Telefónica companies submit that the interpretation adopted by the General Court in the judgments of 21 October 2003, van Calster and Others (C‑261/01 and C‑262/01, EU:C:2003:571), and of 27 November 2003, Enirisorse (C‑34/01 to C‑38/01, EU:C:2003:640), is incorrect.", "The fact that the Court did not rule on the requirement that the fiscal measure must have a direct impact on the amount of the aid did not mean that it considered that that requirement was an additional condition for determining whether the method of financing of the aid is part thereof, but may be explained by the fact that those judgments were delivered in the first cases in which the Court ruled on the question of inseparability. 64", "RTVE, the Kingdom of Spain and the Commission submit that the second part of the first ground of appeal is unfounded.", "– Findings of the Court", "65", "It is settled case-law of the Court that taxes do not fall within the scope of the provisions of the Treaty relating to State aid unless they constitute the method of financing an aid measure, so that they form an integral part of that measure (judgments of 13 January 2005, Streekgewest, C‑174/02, EU:C:2005:10, paragraph 25; of 13 January 2005 in Pape, C‑175/02, EU:C:2005:11, paragraph 14; and of 27 October 2005, Distribution Casino France and Others, C‑266/04 to C‑270/04, C‑276/04 and C‑321/04 to C‑325/04, EU:C:2005:657, paragraph 34).", "66", "Firstly, an aid, in the strict sense, may not substantially affect trade between Member States and thus be deemed admissible, but could have its disruptive effect exacerbated by a method of financing that would make the whole incompatible with the internal market.", "Furthermore, where a tax specifically intended to finance aid proves to be contrary to other provisions of the Treaty, the Commission cannot declare the aid scheme of which the charge forms part to be compatible with the internal market (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 October 2003, van Calster and Others, C‑261/01 and C‑262/01, EU:C:2003:571, paragraphs 47 and 48 and the case-law cited).", "67", "The method by which aid is financed may render the entire aid scheme it is intended to fund incompatible with the internal market.", "As a result, the aid cannot be considered separately from its method of financing (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 April 2005, AEM and AEM Torino, C‑128/03 and C‑129/03, EU:C:2005:224, paragraph 45).", "68", "According to settled case-law, in order for a tax to be regarded as forming an integral part of an aid measure, it must be hypothecated to the aid under the relevant national rules, in the sense that the revenue from the tax is necessarily allocated to the financing of the aid and has a direct impact on the amount of the aid and, consequently, on the assessment of the compatibility of that aid with the internal market (see, inter alia, judgments of 15 June 2006, Air Liquide Industries Belgium, C‑393/04 and C‑41/05, EU:C:2006:403, paragraph 46 and the case-law cited, and of 22 December 2008, Régie Networks, C‑333/07, EU:C:2008:764, paragraph 99).", "69", "In the present case, the General Court found, in paragraphs 65 to 86 of the judgment under appeal, criticised in vain in the second ground of appeal, that it is clear from the applicable national law provisions that the amount of aid allocated to RTVE does not directly depend on the revenue from the fiscal measures at issue, since the amount thereof is determined on the basis of the net costs relating to the fulfilment of the public service mandate entrusted to RTVE.", "70", "In particular, as is apparent from paragraphs 47 and 48 of the present judgment, the General Court noted, in that regard, that when the tax revenues available to RTVE exceed the costs of fulfilling the latter’s public service mandate, the excess must be reassigned, as appropriate, to a reserve fund or the treasury, since those revenues, in addition, are subject to an absolute limit, with the result that any surplus is also reassigned to the State’s general budget.", "Moreover, the General Court found that, where those revenues are insufficient to cover these costs, the Spanish State is required to make up the difference.", "71", "In those circumstances, although it is common ground that the financing of the aid granted to RTVE is ensured by the fiscal measures at issue, the General Court, contrary to what DTS and the Telefónica companies submit, was nevertheless entitled to conclude, without committing an error of law, in paragraph 104 of the judgment under appeal, that those fiscal measures do not form part of the aid.", "72", "Since the revenue from the fiscal measures at issue has no direct impact on the amount of the aid granted to RTVE, given that neither the grant or the amount of the aid are based on that revenue and that the revenue from that aid is not used to finance it, in that part of the revenue may be reallocated to other purposes, it cannot be held that those tax measures are hypothecated to the aid in question.", "73", "It is irrelevant, in that regard, that the fiscal measures at issue were introduced in order to offset the loss of the commercial revenues formerly enjoyed by RTVE, in particular those derived from advertising (see, by analogy, judgment of 13 January 2005, Streekgewest, C‑174/02, EU:C:2005:10, paragraph 27).", "74", "DTS’s line of argument, based on the Laboratoires Boiron judgment, is not such as to call into question those findings.", "75", "In that regard, it should be recalled that, in that judgment, the Court held, in essence, that, in the case of asymmetrical tax liability, that is where only one of two categories of competing traders is liable to pay a tax, traders liable to pay the tax may plead the illegality of it.", "In such a case, the aid derives from the fact that another category of economic operators with which the category liable to pay the tax is in direct competition is not liable for that charge.", "The aid measure is therefore the tax itself, that tax and the aid constituting two elements of one and the same fiscal measure which are inseparable.", "That situation is thus not comparable to that of any exemption from a tax of general application from which that tax may be distinguished (see, to that effect, Laboratoires Boiron judgment, paragraphs 30 to 48).", "76", "The General Court did not err in law in finding, in paragraphs 98 to 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the tax on pay-television operators for which DTS is liable is not comparable to the asymmetrical tax at issue in the case which gave rise to the Laboratoires Boiron judgment.", "77", "In the present case, the fiscal measures at issue and the aid to RTVE do not constitute, as noted by the General Court in paragraph 101 of the judgment under appeal, two elements of one and the same fiscal measure which are inseparable, since, unlike the situation at issue in the case giving rise to the Laboratoires Boiron judgment, the possible inapplicability of the fiscal measures at issue because of their possible incompatibility with EU law does not directly entail the calling into question of the aid, since, as is apparent from paragraphs 48 and 70 of the present judgment, the Spanish State is required to cover the shortfall between the sources of funding available to RTVE and all of the costs incurred by RTVE in carrying out its public service obligations.", "78", "In addition, and as also correctly noted by the General Court in paragraph 102 of the judgment under appeal, in the case giving rise to the Laboratoires Boiron judgment, the amount of the aid was determined only by the amount of the tax, since the benefit which the beneficiaries derived from the liability of their competitors to that tax necessarily depended on the amount of that tax.", "However, in the present case, the amount of the aid is determined, as is apparent from paragraphs 69 to 71 of the present judgment, by the net costs of fulfilling the public service mandate.", "79", "Admittedly, as correctly noted by DTS, in the present case, the tax on pay-television operators is also intended to finance an aid scheme in favour of RTVE which the Commission found to be constitutive of State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "The obligation to pay that tax thus causes DTS an additional competitive disadvantage on the markets on which it operates in competition with RTVE, since the latter is not liable to pay such a tax.", "80", "However, as the General Court correctly pointed out, in paragraphs 84 and 102 of the judgment under appeal, that fact alone is not sufficient to demonstrate that such a tax is an integral part of the aid.", "81", "On the one hand, as the Court has already held, the question whether a tax is an integral part of an aid financed by a tax depends not on the existence of a competitive relationship between the person liable to pay the tax and the beneficiary of the aid, but only on whether that tax is hypothecated to the aid in question under the relevant national legislation (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 December 2008, Régie Networks, C‑333/07, EU:C:2008:764, paragraphs 93 to 99).", "82", "Thus, according to the case-law of the Court, a tax cannot be hypothecated to an exemption from payment of that same tax for a category of undertakings, and thus even where those undertakings operate in competition with undertakings liable to pay the tax in question.", "The application of a tax exemption and its extent do not depend on the tax revenue.", "Thus, those liable to pay a charge cannot rely on the argument that the exemption enjoyed by other undertakings constitutes State aid in order to avoid payment of that charge or to obtain reimbursement thereof (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 27 October 2005, Distribution Casino France and Others, C‑266/04 to C‑270/04, C‑276/04 and C‑321/04 to C‑325/04, EU:C:2005:657, paragraphs 41 and 42).", "83", "On the other hand, as has already been stated in paragraph 65 of the present judgment, taxes are not, in principle, subject to the rules on State aid.", "As noted by the Advocate General in point 96 of his Opinion, DTS’s argument, if followed, would lead to the conclusion that any tax levied at sectoral level and imposed on undertakings in competition with the beneficiary of the aid financed by the tax must be examined under Articles 107 and 108 TFEU.", "84", "It follows from the foregoing that the General Court did not err in law in holding that the tax on pay-television operators is not part of the aid scheme benefiting RTVE.", "85", "Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected as being unfounded.", "The third ground of appeal, alleging an error of law in the application of Article 106(2) TFEU", "Arguments of the parties", "86", "DTS submits that the General Court distorted, in the judgment under appeal, the basis of the second plea seeking annulment raised at first instance, alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU.", "Contrary to what the General Court held in paragraphs 151 and 152 of that judgment, it did not, before that court, rely on any argument relating to the effects of the aid itself granted to RTVE, but only argued that the method of financing that aid aggravated the distortion of competition resulting therefrom and made the whole, composed of the aid and that method of financing, incompatible with the common interest.", "The General Court, in that regard, incorrectly interpreted several of its arguments.", "87", "According to DTS, that distortion led the General Court to rule ultra petita, thus altering the subject matter of the dispute.", "Having itself clarified during the hearing before the General Court that the second plea for annulment was effective only in the event that the first plea was upheld, the General Court, in dismissing that plea, could not examine the second plea.", "In any event, even supposing that the General Court was able to rule on that plea, it was entitled to reject it only for the reason set out in paragraph 151 of the judgment under appeal, to the effect that the Commission was not obliged to take into account the effects of the tax on pay-television operators, since that fiscal measure was not an integral part of the aid.", "The General Court altered the subject matter of the dispute, however, by reinterpreting the second plea raised before it, in paragraph 152 of the judgment, as relating to the effects of the aid itself.", "88", "In so doing, the General Court, according to DTS, exceeded the limits of its jurisdiction relating to the judicial review of the assessments made by the Commission in respect of the principle of proportionality set out in Article 106(2) TFEU.", "The General Court, as part of that review, only has jurisdiction to check whether the Commission made a manifest error of assessment, without having the power to substitute its assessment for that of the Commission, nor, a fortiori, to assess issues that the Commission did not assess.", "Thus, the General Court, having confirmed the Commission’s decision that the tax on pay-television operators is not an integral part of the aid, could only find that the Commission was entitled to authorise the aid in question.", "It could not, however, rule on issues such as the risk of anticompetitive behaviour by RTVE, in particular, the raising of bids, since the Commission did not examine such questions. 89", "RTVE contends that the third plea is inadmissible.", "In any event, it considers, like the Kingdom of Spain and the Commission, that that plea is ineffective or, at the very least, unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "90", "It should be noted that the third ground of appeal rests entirely on the premiss that the General Court misinterpreted the scope of the second plea for annulment raised at first instance alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU.", "91", "It should be noted, however, that, by its appeal, DTS does not dispute any of the assessments made by the General Court, in paragraphs 113 to 167 of the judgment under appeal, in order to justify the rejection of that second plea.", "92", "In particular, DTS in no way claims that that part of the judgment under appeal is vitiated by errors of law; it states at the outset that its appeal does not relate to the review of the compatibility of the aid granted to RTVE with Article 106(2) TFEU.", "93", "It follows that the third ground of appeal, even if it were founded, is in no way capable of leading to the annulment of the judgment under appeal.", "94", "In those circumstances, that ground of appeal must be rejected as ineffective.", "The pleas submitted by the Telefónica companies alleging the infringement of Article 40 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 106(2) TFEU", "95", "In their reply, the Telefónica companies raised a plea alleging infringement of Article 40 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, in which they submit that the General Court erred in law in rejecting as inadmissible their argument relating to the infringement of Article 108 TFEU.", "96", "The Telefónica companies also raised, in that pleading, a plea alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU, in which they argue that the General Court erred in law in conducting an excessively limited review of whether the aid scheme at issue complied with the principle of proportionality, relying in that regard on the Commission’s discretion.", "97", "It is not disputed that those pleas seek annulment of the judgment under appeal on grounds that were not raised by DTS as part of its appeal.", "98", "On the one hand, DTS did not rely on the infringement of Article 40 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union in support of its appeal.On the other, although the third ground of appeal formally relies on the infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU, DTS itself stated in its appeal, as is apparent from paragraph 92 of the present judgment, that it is not seeking to challenge the review of the compatibility of the aid granted to RTVE under that provision, merely alleging, as part of that ground of appeal, that the General Court distorted some of its arguments.", "99", "Under Article 174 of the Rules of Procedure, a response shall seek to have the appeal allowed or dismissed, in whole or in part.", "100", "Furthermore, in accordance with Article 172 of those rules, a party to the relevant case before the General Court may submit, by document separate from the response, a cross-appeal which, according to Article 178(1) and (3), second sentence, of the Rules of Procedure, must seek to have set aside, in whole or in part, the judgment under appeal on the basis of pleas in law and arguments separate from those relied on in the response.", "101", "It is apparent from those provisions, read together, that the reply may not seek the annulment of the judgment under appeal on the basis of distinct and independent grounds from those raised in the appeal, since such grounds may only be raised as part of a cross-appeal.", "102", "Accordingly, the Court rejects as inadmissible the pleas submitted by the Telefónica companies alleging the infringement of Article 40 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 106(2) TFEU.", "The cross-appeal", "103", "In support of its cross-appeal, the Telefónica companies rely on a single plea, alleging infringement of Article 40 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, in that the General Court rejected as inadmissible their argument relating to an infringement of Article 108 TFEU.", "Arguments of the parties", "104", "The Telefónica companies maintain that the General Court was not entitled to reject as inadmissible the pleas for annulment which they raised at first instance, alleging infringement of Article 108 TFEU on the ground that, since they were raised for the first time in the statement in intervention, they were unconnected with the subject matter of the dispute.", "105", "First of all, in paragraph 216 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court was not entitled to rely on the judgment of 19 November 1998, United Kingdom v Council (C‑150/94, EU:C:1998:547), since the Telefónica companies did not refer to that judgment.", "106", "Furthermore, in paragraph 217 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court does not explain how the judgment of 8 July 2010, Commission v Italy (C‑334/08, EU:C:2010:414), entails that the intervener taking part in infringement proceedings has more freedom than the intervener in an action for annulment when it intends to raise pleas not relied on by the main party.", "If the intervener were required to confine itself to the pleas put forward by the main party, Article 132(2) of the Rules of Procedure, under which the intervener is required to set out its pleas in law, would be rendered meaningless.", "107", "RTVE contends that the cross-appeal is inadmissible.", "On the one hand, that appeal is based, in breach of the second sentence of Article 178(3) of the Rules of Procedure, on a single plea that is identical to one of the pleas relied on by the Telefónica companies in their reply to the appeal in the main proceedings.", "Moreover, that cross-appeal does not clearly identify, in breach of the first sentence of the same provision, the grounds of the judgment under appeal which are in dispute.", "In any event, the cross-appeal is unfounded.", "The Kingdom of Spain and the Commission also submit that the arguments of the Telefónica companies must be dismissed.", "Findings of the Court", "Admissibility of the cross-appeal", "108", "Regarding the admissibility of the cross-appeal, it should be recalled that, pursuant to the second sentence of Article 178(3) of the Rules of Procedure, the pleas and legal arguments put forward in support of a cross-appeal must, as already stated in paragraph 100 of the present judgment, be distinct from those relied on in the reply relating to the appeal in the main proceedings.", "109", "In the present case, it appears that, admittedly, the single plea raised by the Telefónica companies in support of their cross-appeal, alleging infringement of Article 40 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, corresponds exactly to one of the arguments raised in the reply to the appeal in the main proceedings brought by DTS.", "110", "However, under penalty of falling foul of the distinction made by the Rules of Procedure between the appeal in the main proceedings and the cross-appeal, the requirement laid down by the second sentence of Article 178(3) of those rules may be understood only as being based on the premiss that the pleas and arguments set out in the reply are, themselves, analogous to those raised in the appeal in the main proceedings.", "111", "In the present case, as is apparent from paragraphs 95 to 102 of the present judgment, the plea put forward by the Telefónica companies in their reply relating to the appeal in the main proceedings brought by DTS, alleging infringement of Article 40 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, is inadmissible because it is distinct from those of the appeal.", "112", "As regards compliance with the requirement laid down by the first sentence of Article 178(3) of the Rules of Procedure, it is sufficient to note that the cross-appeal expressly refers to paragraphs 207 to 218 of the judgment under appeal and, therefore, that it does clearly identify the grounds of that judgment which are in dispute.", "113", "In those circumstances, it must be held that the cross-appeal is admissible in that it refers to paragraphs 207 to 218 of the judgment under appeal.", "Substance", "114", "With respect to whether the cross-appeal is well founded, it should be recalled that a party who, pursuant to Article 40 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, is granted leave to intervene in a case submitted to the Court may not alter the subject matter of the dispute as defined by the forms of order sought and the pleas in law raised by the main parties.", "It follows that arguments submitted by an intervener are not admissible unless they fall within the framework provided by those forms of order and pleas in law (judgment of 7 October 2014, Germany v Council, C‑399/12, EU:C:2014:2258, paragraph 27).", "115", "In the present case, the Telefónica companies allege, in the single plea of their cross-appeal, that the General Court dismissed as inadmissible, in paragraphs 207 to 218 of the judgment under appeal, the pleas, raised in their statement in intervention before the General Court, in which they alleged that the Commission infringed Article 108 TFEU.", "116", "It is not disputed that DTS did not rely on the infringement of that provision in support of its action at first instance, since the three pleas it relied on in order to seek annulment of the contested decision alleged the infringement, respectively, of Article 107 TFEU, Articles 49 and 64 TFEU and Article 106(2) TFEU.", "117", "It follows that, as the General Court held in paragraph 212 of the judgment under appeal, the pleas put forward by the Telefónica companies in its statement in intervention before the General Court were wholly unconnected with the subject matter of the dispute as it had been defined by DTS and altered the framework of the dispute to a degree which was contrary to Article 40 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.", "118", "In that regard, the General Court correctly held, in paragraph 217 of the judgment under appeal, that the solution adopted in the judgment of 8 July 2010, Commission v Italy (C‑334/08, EU:C:2010:414), in the context of infringement proceedings under Article 260 TFEU, could not be transposed to an action for annulment under Article 263 TFEU.", "119", "Infringement proceedings are based on the objective finding that a Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under EU law (see, in particular, judgment of 6 October 2009, Commission v Spain, C‑562/07, EU:C:2009:614, paragraph 18).", "120", "It follows that, as the General Court correctly held in paragraph 217 of the judgment under appeal, in the context of such proceedings, the Court must make all the necessary determinations in order to reach a finding of a failure to fulfil obligations, with the result that a plea in defence, raised by an intervener, which relates to an element of fact or law that the Commission must necessarily take account of in its analysis is not capable of altering the framework of the dispute, even if it was not relied on by the Member State concerned.", "In contrast, an action for annulment is defined in particular by the pleas in law relied on by the applicant.", "121", "Moreover, although, under Article 132(2)(b) of the Rules of Procedure, the statement in intervention is to contain the pleas in law and arguments relied on by the intervener, that does not mean that the intervener is free to rely on new pleas in law, distinct from those relied on by the applicant.", "As noted by the Advocate General in point 219 of his Opinion, that provision falls within the context of the limits established by the intervention procedure and must be read in the light of Article 129 of that regulation, which states that the intervention is to be limited to supporting, in whole or in part, the form of order sought by one of the parties, that it is ancillary to the main proceedings and that the intervener must accept the case as he finds it at the time of his intervention.", "122", "As to the Telefónica companies’ complaint that the General Court referred, in paragraph 216 of the judgment under appeal, to the judgment of 19 November 1998, United Kingdom v Council (C‑150/94, EU:C:1998:547), it is sufficient to state that it is completely ineffective, since it is not such as to vitiate the judgment under appeal by an error of law; those companies do not, moreover, argue that the assessment carried out by the General Court in that paragraph is legally flawed.", "123", "Consequently, the single plea raised in the cross-appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "Costs", "124", "In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs.", "Under Article 138(1) of those rules, applicable, mutatis mutandis, to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "125", "Since DTS has been unsuccessful and the Commission has applied for costs, it should be ordered to bear, in addition to its own costs, those incurred by the Commission in the appeal in the main proceedings.", "126", "As regards the cross-appeal, since the Telefónica companies have been unsuccessful and the Commission has applied for costs, they must also be ordered to bear their own costs

European Commission seeks to have set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 24 June 2015, Italy v Commission (T‑527/13, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2015:429), by which the General Court partially annulled Commission Decision 2013/665/EU of 17 July 2013 on State aid SA.33726 (11/C) [ex SA.33726 (11/NN)] granted by Italy (deferral of payment of the milk levy) (OJ 2013

summarised the background to the case in paragraphs 1 to 8 of the judgment under appeal as follows:", "‘1", "In order to enable Italian milk producers to pay the additional levy of EUR 1386475000 owed to the European Union for exceeding the milk quota allocated to the Italian Republic during the period 1995/1996 to 2001/2002, the Italian Republic sought authorisation from the Council of the European Union to establish a State aid scheme pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 88(2) EC.", "2", "By Decision 2003/530/EC of 16 July 2003 on the compatibility with the common market of an aid that the Italian Republic intends to grant to its milk producers (OJ 2003 L 184, p. 15, “the Council decision”), the Council authorised that Member State to “itself mak[e] payment to the [European Union] of the amount due from them to the [European Union] by virtue of the additional levy on milk and milk products for the period 1995/1996 to 2001/2002” (Article 1 of the Council decision).", "The Council also authorised it to “[allow the interested parties] to repay their debt [in relation to the Italian Republic] by way of deferred payment over a number of years without interest” (Article 1 of the Council decision).", "3", "That statement of compatibility was subject to two sets of conditions.", "In the first place, the Council required the Italian authorities, first, to declare the amount corresponding to the additional levy owed by the milk producers to the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and, secondly, to deduct their outstanding debt to the European Union and the interest thereon from the expenditure financed by the EAGGF (Article 2 of the Council decision).", "In the second place, it required the milk producers to repay in full their debt to the Italian Republic in yearly instalments of equal size and to do so over a period not exceeding 14 years starting from 1 January 2004 (Article 1 of the Council decision).", "4", "In that context, the Italian authorities adopted decreto-legge n. 49, riforma della normativa in tema di applicazione del prelievo supplementare nel settore del latte e dei prodotti lattiero-caseari (Decree-law No 49 reforming the rules on the application of the additional levy in the milk and dairy products sector) of 28 March 2003 (GURI No 75 of 31 March 2003, p. 4), and decreto ministeriale del 30 luglio 2003,

33).", "The combined provisions of those two measures provided, in essence, that the amount of the additional levy borne by the Italian Republic would be fully repaid to it by the milk producers, without interest, in the form of annual payment instalments of the same amount deferred over a period not exceeding 14 years (“the system of staggered payments”).", "5", "Having amended those provisions on several occasions …, the Italian authorities adopted legge n. 10, Conversione in legge, con modificazioni, del decreto-legge 29 dicembre 2010, n. 225, recante proroga di termini previsti da disposizioni legislative e di interventi urgenti in materia tributaria e di sostegno alle imprese e alle famiglie (Law No 10, converting into law, with amendments, Decree-Law No 225 of 29 December

legislation] have been extended until 30 June 2011” (“the deferral of payment”).", "6", "The Italian authorities informed the … Commission that the “grant equivalent” of that measure had been offset against the de minimis aid provided for that Member State by the annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1535/2007 of 20 December 2007 on the application of Articles [107 TFEU] and [108 TFEU] to de

of payment of the milk levy in Italy, a summary of which was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 10 February 2012 (OJ 2012 C 37, p. 30), the Commission initiated the procedure laid down in Article 108(2) TFEU.", "In the first place, it indicated, in essence, that it had doubts relating to the classification of the deferral of payment in the light of Article 107 TFEU, and to the compatibility of that measure with the internal market.", "In the second place, the Commission stated that that deferral of payment gave rise to an infringement of one of the conditions laid down in the Council decision, that that infringement transformed the whole system of staggered payments established by the Italian authorities into new aid, in so far as it related to milk producers who had benefited from the deferral of payment, and that the compatibility of that new aid with the internal market had also not been established.", "8", "By [the decision at issue], the Commission considered, following the exchange with the Italian authorities during the administrative procedure, that each of the two measures at issue, namely, the deferral of payment, on the one hand, and the system of staggered payments, on the other hand, constituted new and unlawful aid which was incompatible with the internal market (Article 1 of the [decision at issue]).", "It therefore ordered the Italian Republic to ensure the immediate and effective recovery of the sums granted to milk producers who had benefited from the deferral of payment, together with interest (Articles 2 and 3 of the [decision at issue]).’", "The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal", "6", "By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 30 September 2013, the Italian Republic brought an action, principally, for the total annulment of the decision at issue.", "In the alternative, it sought the partial annulment of that decision in so far as the Commission, by that decision, requires the Italian Republic to recover the individual aid granted, in accordance with the aid scheme previously authorised by the Council decision, to the Italian milk producers who benefited from a deferral of payment.", "7", "In support of its application, the Italian Republic raised two pleas in law, the first alleging infringement of Article 3(7) of Regulation No 1535/2007, and the second alleging infringement of Article 3(2) of that regulation, Article 1(c) of Regulation No 659/1999 and Article 4(1) of Regulation No 794/2004, and a failure to state adequate reasons.", "8", "The General Court upheld the second plea of the Italian Republic and annulled Article 1(2) of the decision at issue, and Articles 2 to 4 of that decision in so far as those articles concern, first, the aid scheme referred to in Article 1(2) of the decision at issue and, secondly, the individual aid granted under that aid scheme; it dismissed the action as to the remainder.", "Forms of

"–", "order the Italian Republic to pay the costs of both sets of proceedings.", "10", "The Italian Republic contends that the Court should:", "–", "dismiss the appeal, and", "–", "order the Commission to pay the costs.", "The appeal", "11", "The Commission raises three grounds of appeal.", "The first ground of appeal alleges infringement of the rule prohibiting the General Court from raising of its own motion a plea relating to the substantive legality of the decision at issue.", "The second ground of appeal alleges infringement of Article 108 TFEU and Article 1 of Regulation No 659/1999 concerning the definitions of ‘new aid’ and ‘existing aid’.", "By its third ground of appeal, the Commission alleges an infringement of Article 108 TFEU and Articles 4, 6, 7, 14 and 16 of Regulation No 659/1999 concerning the procedures applicable to new aid and misused aid.", "First ground of appeal: rule prohibiting the Court from raising of its own motion a plea relating to the substantive legality of the decision at issue", "Arguments of the parties", "12", "By its first ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court ruled ultra petita, and infringed the principle that a court must rule on the issues submitted to it, Article 21 of the Protocol of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 44(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court by raising of its own motion a plea relating to the substantive legality of the decision at issue.", "It submits that, in paragraphs 39 to 44 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court, by defining the scope of the second ground of appeal raised before it, reclassified that ground.", "It thus examined of its own motion the issue whether the system of staggered payments had to be classified as existing aid and not new aid owing to the allegedly insubstantial nature of the alteration made to it by the Italian authorities, which led it to annul in part the decision at issue.", "In the originating application that issue was raised by that Member State only in relation to the alleged infringement of Article 4(1) of Regulation No 794/2004.", "13", "The Italian Republic alleges that that ground of appeal must be rejected as being unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "14", "It follows from the rules governing proceedings before the EU Courts, in particular Article 21 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, applicable before the General Court pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute and Article 44(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, in the version applicable when the originating application was lodged, that the case is in principle determined and delimited by the parties and that the EU Courts cannot adjudicate ultra petita (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 December 2013, Commission v Ireland and Others, C‑272/12 P, EU:C:2013:812, paragraph 27).", "15", "While certain pleas may, and indeed must, be raised by the courts of their own motion, such as the question whether a statement of reasons for the decision at issue is lacking or is inadequate, which falls within the scope of essential procedural requirements, a plea going to the substantive legality of that decision, which falls within the scope of infringement of the Treaties or of any rule of law relating to their application, within the meaning of Article 263 TFEU, can, by contrast, be examined by the Courts of the European Union only if it is raised by the applicant (judgment of 10 December 2013, Commission v Irelandand Others, C‑272/12 P, EU:C:2013:812, paragraph 28 and the case-law cited).", "16", "In the present case, it must be observed that it is apparent from the actual wording of the second plea in law raised by the Italian Republic before the General Court that that plea concerns the infringement of Article 1(c) of Regulation No 659/1999, which defines the concept of ‘new aid’.", "Moreover, the complaint concerning the infringement of that provision is formulated differently from the one concerning the infringement of Article 4(1) of Regulation No 794/2004 and the failure to state adequate reasons.", "17", "In addition, in paragraphs 54 to 56 of the originating application, the Italian Republic claimed that the withdrawal of the aid resulting from the deferral of payment, in itself, is equivalent to the consequence laid down in the TFEU in the event of a finding that that aid is unlawful, and therefore should not also lead to the withdrawal of aid legally granted beforehand under the system of staggered payments.", "In paragraph 56 of its application, it claimed, in that regard, that ‘there is no evidence capable of establishing that the beneficiaries of the existing aid who benefited from the measure at issue are required to repay not only the amount corresponding to the measure at issue, but also that received as part of the existing aid (and therefore, on the basis of the authorisation decision, the interest unpaid on the first staggered payment)’.", "18", "Furthermore, in paragraph 57 of that application, the Italian Republic argued: ‘Nor is it possible to take the view that the recovery decision may be extended to existing aid as a result of a substantial alteration to that aid which is capable of resulting in those two measures being regarded as a single new aid, not notified to the Commission and therefore unlawful’.", "Such a finding, in its opinion, would be ‘the clear result of a distortion of the concept of “alteration of existing aid”, relevant for the application of Article 1(c) of Regulation No 659/1999’, as is apparent from the first sentence of paragraph 58 of that application.", "19", "Therefore, contrary to what the Commission submits, the Italian Republic argued in its application at first instance that the Commission had infringed Article 1(c) of Regulation No 659/1999 by classifying, in the decision at issue, the staggering of payments as new and unlawful aid, and by wrongly requiring that Member State to recover that aid.", "20", "In addition, as the Advocate General stated in point 38 of his opinion, it is clear from paragraphs 22 and 32 to 36 of the defence lodged by the Commission before the General Court that the Commission had indeed understood that complaint which it summarised and refuted in its pleading.", "21", "It follows that the General Court, contrary to what the Commission argues, did not raise of its own motion a plea relating to the substantive legality of the decision at issue by ruling on the second plea in law of the application before it.", "22", "In the light of the foregoing, the first ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "Second ground of appeal: infringement of Article 108 TFEU and of Article 1 of Regulation No 659/1999 concerning the definitions of ‘new aid’ and ‘existing aid’", "23", "The second ground of appeal essentially comprises two parts.", "The first part of that ground relates to the fact that the General Court wrongly classified the aid implemented, in breach of the conditions for authorising existing aid and not new aid.", "By the second part of that ground, the Commission claims that the General Court, in making such a finding, did not take into account the institutional balance between the Council and the Commission.", "24", "It is appropriate to commence the examination with the first part of that ground.", "Arguments of the parties", "25", "By the first part of its second ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law in its interpretation of the concepts of ‘new aid’ and ‘existing aid’.", "Essentially, it challenges the General Court’s assessment, in paragraphs 74 to 91 of the judgment under appeal, that the system of staggered payments, which constitutes an existing aid scheme, having been granted conditional authorisation from the Council and having subsequently been altered in breach of the authorisation conditions for that system, must be regarded as an existing aid scheme and not as a new aid scheme, on the ground that the Commission did not establish that that alteration affects the actual substance of the pre-existing measure.", "26", "The Italian Republic contends that the General Court correctly required the Commission, for the purposes of reclassifying the existing aid as new aid, to provide evidence that the infringement of the authorisation conditions for the existing aid scheme constitutes a substantial alteration to that scheme, which, in the opinion of that Member State, must be assessed having regard to Article 4(1) of Regulation No 794/2004.", "It is apparent from the case-law that it is only where the alteration made to existing aid is not clearly severable from the original aid scheme and that alteration also affects the actual substance of that original scheme that the latter is transformed into a new aid scheme (judgment of the Court of Justice of 9 October 1984, Heineken Brouwerijen, 91/83 and 127/83, EU:C:1984:307, paragraphs 21 and 22, and judgment of the General Court of 30 April 2002, Government of Gibraltar v Commission, T‑195/01 and T‑207/01, EU:T:2002:111).", "Furthermore, it follows from the case-law of the Court of Justice that the criteria laid down by case-law also apply where the alteration constitutes an infringement of the authorisation conditions for an existing aid scheme (judgment of 13 June 2013, HGA and Others v Commission, C‑630/11 P to C‑633/11 P, EU:C:2013:387, paragraphs 91, 94 and 95).", "27", "In that regard, the Italian Republic argues that, if existing aid may, as a result of alterations, be reclassified as new aid where those alterations have not affected the actual substance of the existing aid, that would lead to the nature of the procedure for reviewing State aid being transformed, which would therefore take on the characteristics of a penalty.", "28", "The Italian Republic adds that, in any event, the Commission has the option of using other procedures when reviewing State aid.", "29", "Thus, although the alteration made to existing aid itself constitutes new and therefore unlawful aid, the Commission could adopt a decision prohibiting the implementation of the measure introducing that new aid, or, if that measure has already been implemented, order recovery of the new aid, thus restoring the conditions under which the existing aid had been authorised.", "That solution is the one which was adopted in the judgment under appeal.", "Findings of the Court", "30", "By the first part of this ground of appeal, the Commission challenges the interpretation of the concepts of ‘new aid’ and ‘existing aid’, within the meaning of Article 1(b) and (c) of Regulation No 659/1999, on which the General Court’s reasoning in paragraphs 74 to 91 of the judgment under appeal is based.", "31", "As a preliminary point, it must be observed that, in paragraphs 69 to 76 of that judgment, the General Court relied on, among the various procedures which the Commission could have used where a Member State had not complied with a decision which declared aid or an aid scheme compatible with the internal market subject to certain conditions, the procedure relating to unlawful aid, laid down in Chapter III of Regulation No 659/1999.", "32", "In that regard, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 69 and 70 of that judgment, that ‘since the infringement attributed to the Italian Republic consisted in the granting of a measure likely to be classified as new aid, the Commission was entitled to use [that procedure] … in order to examine that measure, as it decided to do in the present case’, but ‘had to comply, in that context, with the substantive conditions enabling it to classify not only the deferral of payment taken in isolation but also the whole of the pre-existing system of staggered payments as aid or as an aid scheme which is new and unlawful’.", "33", "The General Court considered, in paragraph 76 of that judgment, ‘that the possibility, for the Commission, of classifying as new, and, where necessary, unlawful, aid not only the alterations of existing aid, but also all the existing aid to which that alteration relates, was subject, as regards the substance, to the condition that the Commission establish that the alteration affected the very substance of the pre-existing measure’.", "It added that, ‘in the event that the Member Sate concerned submits, during the administrative procedure, either that that alteration is clearly severable from the pre-existing measure, or that it is purely formal or administrative in character and is not capable of influencing the assessment of the compatibility of that measure with the internal market, the Commission must justify why [the arguments of that Member State] appear to it to be unfounded’.", "34", "In paragraphs 78 to 80 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court considered that the Commission had not demonstrated in the decision at issue that the deferral of payment affected the actual substance of the system of staggered payments, a question which it considered to be irrelevant.", "35", "The General Court thus concluded, in paragraphs 81 and 82 of that judgment, that the Commission not only ‘misconstrued the concept of “new aid” by reclassifying an existing aid scheme as new unlawful aid without complying with the substantive conditions laid down in Regulation No 659/1999’, but also wrongly ordered the recovery of the aid granted under the existing aid scheme.", "In doing so, it rejected, in paragraphs 83 to 91 of that judgment, the arguments put forward by the Commission to show that the failure by the Italian authorities to comply with one of the conditions in the declaration of compatibility adopted by the Council entailed, in essence, the reclassification of the existing aid scheme as new and unlawful aid.", "36", "The Court must therefore ascertain whether, as the Commission claims, the General Court’s reasoning is vitiated by an error of law.", "37", "Under the terms of the Council decision, the Italian Republic was authorised in 2003, as is apparent from Article 1 of that decision, to take the place of its milk producers and to pay to the European Union the sum owed by those producers by virtue of the additional levy on milk and milk products for the period 1995/1996 to 2001/2002, and to allow those producers to repay their debt to the Italian Republic by way of an interest-free deferral of payment over a number of years.", "The aid scheme authorised by that decision thus consisted, essentially, in granting to the Italian milk producers interest-free loans which were to be repaid in instalments over a number of years.", "38", "It follows from Article 1 of the Council decision that the Council considered, ‘exceptionally’, the system of staggered payments to be compatible with the internal market and made that compatibility subject to the condition that, first, ‘repayment shall be in full by yearly instalments of equal size,’ and secondly, ‘the repayment period shall not exceed 14 years, starting from 1 January 2004.", "39", "Recital 8 of the Council decision relating to the reasons underpinning that decision, states that the Council considered that, ‘in order to avoid the imposition of heavy financial burdens on the individual Italian milk producers concerned, which would probably be caused by the immediate recovery in full of all the amounts due [to the Community by virtue of the additional levy on milk and milk products as a result of those producers exceeding the reference quantities in the periods 1995/1996 to 2001/2002] and thus to alleviate the existing social tensions’, ‘exceptional circumstances … [justified] considering the aid which the Italian Republic [intended] to grant to these milk producers in the form of an advance and a deferred payment to be compatible with the [internal] market in derogation from Article [107 TFEU], if the conditions laid down in this Decision are fulfilled’.", "40", "It thus follows from Article 1 of the Council decision, read in the light of recital 8 of that decision, that the Council made the grant of that exceptional aid expressly dependent on the milk producers complying with two conditions, that is to say, first, the producers are required to repay the aid granted in full by yearly instalments of equal size, and secondly, the repayment period will be limited by an instalment plan beginning on 1 January 2004 and must not go beyond 14 years.", "41", "Thus, it follows from that decision that, in the opinion of the Council, the compatibility of that scheme with the internal market and ultimately the authorisation of that scheme are subject to compliance with the conditions laid down in Article 1 of that decision.", "42", "However, by legge n. 10, Conversione in legge, con modificazioni, del decreto-legge 29 dicembre 2010, n. 225, recante proroga di termini previsti da disposizioni legislative e di interventi urgenti in materia tributaria e di sostegno alle imprese e alle famiglie (Law No 10, converting into law, with amendments, Decree-Law No 225 of 29 December 2010, extending time-limits laid down by legislative provisions and urgent interventions in tax matters and to support undertakings and families) of 26 February 2011 (GURI No 47 of 26 February 2011, Ordinary Supplement No 53), which entered into force on 27 February 2011, the Italian Republic deferred until 30 June 2011 payment of the annual instalments due on 31 December 2010.", "43", "That deferral of payment did not take into account the condition laid down in Article 1 of the Council decision, under which interest-free loans granted by the Italian Republic are to be reimbursed in yearly instalments of equal size, where compliance with that condition was regarded by the Council as ensuring compatibility of the aid with the single market.", "44", "Consequently, it must be observed that the legislative alteration referred to in paragraph 42 above had the effect of transforming the aid scheme authorised by the Council decision into new and unlawful aid.", "45", "That finding follows from the examination of the wording, context and aim of Article 1(c) of Regulation No 659/1999.", "46", "Thus, by virtue of Article 1(c) of that regulation, ‘new aid’ is defined as ‘all aid, that is to say, aid schemes and individual aid, which is not existing aid, including alterations to existing aid’.", "Since that provision is established in broad terms, it is capable of covering not only the alteration itself, but also the aid concerned by that alteration.", "47", "In addition, it must be pointed out that, according to Article 1(b)(ii) of that regulation, ‘existing aid’ is understood as being, inter alia, ‘authorised aid, that is to say, aid schemes and individual aid which have been authorised by the Commission or by the Council’.", "Thus, aid which was the subject of an authorisation decision and which, as a result of an alteration that did not satisfy a condition laid down by that decision in order to ensure the compatibility of that aid with the internal market, is no longer covered by the decision which authorised it, may constitute new aid.", "48", "The deferral of payment does not constitute an alteration of a purely formal or administrative nature, nor can it be qualified as an increase in the original budget of an aid scheme within the meaning of Article 4(1) of Regulation No 794/2004.", "That measure was taken in breach of an authorisation condition governing the repayment of aid authorised exceptionally by the Council under the third subparagraph of Article 108(2) TFEU, a condition which the Council decided would ensure the compatibility of the aid scheme at issue with the internal market.", "Thus, contrary to what the Italian Republic maintains, the Commission was correct in concluding that new aid had been granted, relying solely on the failure to satisfy that condition.", "49", "It must be added that a sufficiently broad interpretation of the concept of ‘new aid’, within the meaning of Article 1(c) of Regulation No 659/1999, covering not only the alteration made by the Member State concerned to an existing aid scheme, in breach of the authorisation conditions for that scheme, but also the entire aid scheme as altered, makes it possible to ensure the effectiveness of the system of review of State aid in the European Union by promoting compliance by the Member State concerned with the authorisation conditions for the aid scheme.", "Thus, if a Member State makes an alteration to an existing aid scheme in breach of an authorisation condition for that scheme, that Member State will have no guarantee that the authorised aid scheme is not affected by that alteration and that the advantages granted on the basis of that scheme will therefore be retained.", "50", "The case-law of the Court of Justice relied on by the Italian Republic in support of its arguments, set out in paragraph 26 above, is not relevant to the present case.", "51", "First, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the judgment of 9 October 1984, Heineken Brouwerijen (91/83 and 127/83, EU:C:1984:307), that, if a plan initially notified has in the meantime undergone an alteration of which the Commission has not been informed, the prohibition on implementation in Article 108(3) TFEU applies to the plan as altered in its entirety.", "The position would be different only if that alteration in fact constituted a separate aid measure which should be assessed separately and which would therefore not be such as to influence the assessment which the Commission already made of the original aid plan; in that case, the prohibition applies only to the aid measure introduced by the alteration.", "In the light of the finding in paragraph 43 above, that scenario does not concern the alteration at issue, in that it affects a condition to which the declaration of compatibility of the original aid plan was subject.", "52", "Secondly, in paragraphs 89 to 95 of the judgment of 13 June 2013, HGA and Others v Commission (C‑630/11 P to C‑633/11 P, EU:C:2013:387), the Court of Justice examined the issue whether the alteration made to an original aid scheme in breach of the approval conditions for that aid scheme constituted an alteration of existing aid, within the meaning of Article 1(c) of Regulation No 659/1999, thereby giving rise to new and unlawful aid.", "It did not, however, examine the effects of that alteration on the original aid scheme.", "53", "The General Court, in paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal, required the Commission to establish that the alteration to the existing aid affects the very substance of the pre-existing measure, in order to classify as new, and where necessary, unlawful, aid, not only that alteration, but also all the existing aid to which that alteration relates.", "54", "In doing so, the General Court misconstrued the concept of ‘new aid’, within the meaning of Article 1(c) of Regulation No 659/1999, and therefore committed an error of law.", "As is apparent from paragraphs 46 to 52 above and as was observed, in essence, by the Advocate General in point 76 of his Opinion, existing aid which has been altered in breach of the compatibility conditions imposed by the Commission or the Council can no longer be regarded as authorised and, as a result, loses the status of existing aid in its entirety.", "55", "Therefore, the General Court, having held, in paragraphs 81 and 82 of the judgment under appeal, after examining the grounds of the decision at issue in paragraphs 77 to 80 of that judgment, that ‘the Commission [had] not only misconstrued the concept of “new aid” by reclassifying an existing aid scheme as new unlawful aid without complying with the substantive conditions laid down in Regulation No 659/1999 and the case-law on that subject’, but ‘also, and consequently, wrongly ordered the recovery, from the milk producers who benefited from the deferral of payment, … the individual aid granted … under that existing aid scheme’ committed another error of law.", "56", "In view of the foregoing considerations, the second ground of appeal should be upheld and paragraphs 1 and 2 of the operative part of the judgment under appeal should be set aside, without it being necessary to examine either the second part of the second ground of appeal or the third ground of appeal.", "57", "In view of the fact that the judgment under appeal is to be partially set aside, the General Court’s decision on costs, and therefore paragraph 4 of the operative part of the judgment under appeal, must also be set aside.", "The action before the General Court", "58", "In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, if the Court of Justice quashes the decision of the General Court, it may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits.", "That is the case here.", "59", "It follows from paragraphs 30 to 52 above that the Italian Republic’s complaints in its second plea in law in its action before the General Court relating to the merits of the decision at issue must be rejected as being unfounded.", "Since the first plea in law and the other complaints raised in the second plea in law were rejected by the General Court, the action must be dismissed in its entirety.", "Costs", "60", "Under Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to the costs.", "61", "Under Article 138(1) of those Rules of Procedure, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "62", "Since the Commission has applied for costs and the Italian Republic has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission relating to the appeal proceedings.", "Furthermore, since

European Communities and the Kingdom of Spain seek to have set aside the judgment of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities (now ‘the General Court’) of 18 December 2008 in Joined Cases T‑211/04 and T‑215/04 Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom v Commission [2008] ECR II‑3745 (‘the judgment under appeal’), by which that Court annulled Commission Decision 2005/261/EC of 30 March 2004 on the aid scheme which the United Kingdom is planning to implement as regards the Government of Gibraltar Corporation Tax Reform (OJ 2005 L 85, p. 1; ‘the contested decision’).", "I – Legal context", "2 Article 6 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [88 EC] (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1) provides:", "‘Formal

extend the prescribed period.’", "II – Facts", "A – Background to the Government of Gibraltar’s reform of corporate tax", "3 On 11 July 2001, the Commission decided to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC in respect of two corporate tax measures applied in Gibraltar, respectively concerning ‘exempt companies’ (OJ 2002 C 26, p. 13) and ‘qualifying companies’ (OJ 2002 C 26, p. 9).", "4 In order to qualify for exempt company status, a company had to meet a number of conditions.", "Those conditions included the prohibition of carrying on or transacting any trade or business in Gibraltar, other than with other exempt or qualifying companies.", "With some exceptions, an exempt company was exempted from payment of income tax in Gibraltar and was liable only to taxation at a fixed sum of GBP 225 per annum.", "5 The conditions for the grant of qualifying company status were, essentially, identical to those necessary for exempt company status.", "Qualifying companies paid tax at a rate negotiated with the Gibraltar tax authorities of between 2% and 10% of profits.", "6 By judgment of 30 April 2002 in Joined Cases T-195/01 and T-207/01 Government of Gibraltar v Commission [2002] ECR II-2309, the General Court, first, annulled the decision initiating the formal investigation procedure relating to exempt companies on the ground that the Commission had classified the entire scheme relating to such companies as new aid and, second, dismissed the application for annulment of the decision to initiate the procedure relating to qualifying companies.", "7 The procedure relating to exempt companies resulted in the Commission’s decision of 19 January 2005 to propose appropriate measures, which were accepted by the United Kingdom on 18 February 2005 (OJ 2005 C 228, p. 9).", "Following the procedure relating to qualifying companies, on 30 March 2004 the Commission adopted Decision 2005/77/EC on the aid scheme implemented by the United Kingdom in favour of Gibraltar Qualifying Companies (OJ 2005 L 29, p. 24), by which it declared the regime relating to those companies incompatible with the common market.", "B – The Government of Gibraltar’s reform of corporate tax", "8 On 27 April 2002, without prejudice to whether or not the tax regimes relating to exempt companies and to qualifying companies constituted State aid, the Government of Gibraltar announced its intention to repeal all its corporate tax laws and introduce an entirely new corporate tax regime for all companies in Gibraltar.", "This reform of corporate tax by the Government of Gibraltar forms the subject-matter of the present dispute.", "9 By letter of 12 August 2002, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland notified the Commission, pursuant to Article 88(3) EC, of the proposed reform of corporate tax (‘the proposed tax reform’) which the Government of Gibraltar planned to introduce.", "10 In order to be implemented by the Government of Gibraltar, the proposed tax reform had first to be passed by the Gibraltar House of Assembly.", "As part of the reform, the legislation governing exempt companies and qualifying companies up until that time was to be repealed with immediate effect.", "11 The proposed tax reform comprises, as is apparent from paragraph 18 of the judgment under appeal, a system of taxation applicable to all companies established in Gibraltar and a top-up (or penalty) tax applicable solely to companies in the financial services sector and to utilities, which include undertakings operating in the telecommunications, electricity and water sectors.", "12 The features of the system of taxation that would be introduced under that proposal are set out as follows in paragraphs 21 to 25 of the judgment under appeal:", "‘21 The system of taxation that is introduced by the reform and will be applicable to all companies established in Gibraltar consists of a payroll tax, a business property occupation tax and a registration fee:", "– payroll tax: all Gibraltar companies will be liable to a payroll tax in the amount of GBP 3 000 per employee each year; every “employer” in Gibraltar will be required to pay payroll tax in respect of the total number of its full-time and part-time “employees” who are “employed in Gibraltar”; the legislation relating to the tax reform will define the abovementioned terms;", "– business property occupation tax (“BPOT”): all companies occupying property in Gibraltar for business purposes will have to pay a tax on the occupation of that property at a rate equivalent to a percentage of their liability to the general rates charged on property in Gibraltar;", "– registration fee: all Gibraltar companies will have to pay an annual registration fee, of GBP 150 per annum in the case of companies not intended to generate income and of GBP 300 per annum in the case of companies intended to generate income.", "22 Liability to payroll tax together with BPOT will be capped at 15% of profits.", "The effect of this cap is that companies will pay payroll tax and BPOT only if they make a profit, and in an amount not exceeding 15% of profits.", "…", "23 Certain activities, namely financial services and activities of utilities, will be subject to a top-up (or penalty) tax on profits generated by them.", "The top-up tax will apply only to profits that can be allocated to those activities.", "24 Thus, financial services companies will be charged, in addition to payroll tax and BPOT, a top-up (or penalty) tax on profits from financial services activities at a rate of between 4% and 6% of profits (calculated in accordance with internationally accepted accounting standards); such companies will have their tax liability (payroll tax, BPOT and top-up tax) capped, in aggregate, at 15% of profits.", "25 Utility companies will be charged, in addition to payroll tax and BPOT, a top-up (or penalty) tax on profits from their activities at the rate of 35% of profits (calculated in accordance with internationally accepted accounting standards).", "Such companies will be permitted to deduct payroll tax and BPOT from their liability to top-up tax.", "Although utility companies will also have their annual liability to payroll tax and BPOT capped, in aggregate, at 15% of profits, the operation of the utilities top-up tax will ensure that these companies always pay a tax equal to 35% of profits.’", "III – The administrative procedure and the contested decision", "13 After the United Kingdom had notified the Commission of the proposed tax reform, the Commission, by letter of 16 October 2002, informed the United Kingdom of its decision to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) EC (‘the decision to initiate the formal procedure’) and invited interested parties to submit comments (OJ 2002 C 300, p. 2).", "14 That decision refers to paragraph 9 of the Commission notice on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation (OJ 1998 C 384, p. 3; ‘the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation’).", "In paragraphs 29 to 33 and 37 to 44 of the decision the Commission lists four elements of the proposed tax reform which it regards as conferring materially selective advantages, namely, the requirement to make a profit which confers advantages on companies that make no profit, the various tax caps conferring advantages on those companies to which they apply, exemption from tax for undertakings based in certain areas of Gibraltar and, lastly, exemption of interest received in respect of loans granted for certain purposes.", "Offshore companies are not mentioned as enjoying a selective advantage.", "15 In paragraph 60(f) of the decision to initiate the formal procedure, the Commission requests the United Kingdom to provide the following information:", "‘an estimate of the number, size and type of activity of:", "– companies that will make no profit and consequently escape liability for payroll tax and BPOT,", "– profit-making companies with no employees (i.e. zero assessable employee units),", "– profit-making companies with less than one employee (excluding those with zero).’", "16 The Commission received comments from the United Kingdom, the Confederación Española de Organizaciones Empresariales (Spanish Confederation of Business Organisations), the Ålands Landskapsstyrelse (Åland Executive (Finland)), the Kingdom of Spain and the Government of Gibraltar.", "17 The Kingdom of Spain stated in point 3 of its comments submitted to the Commission on 3 January 2003:", "‘…", "In addition to these comments endorsing the objections raised by the Commission, which are sufficient on their own fundamentally to call into question the validity of the reform proposed by the United Kingdom on behalf of the Gibraltar Government, we consider it essential that the assessment of the compatibility of the scheme should take due account of the real economic and tax context of the jurisdiction proposing it.", "The proposed tax reform comprises some highly peculiar features, such as the following:", "…", "(c) For the 28 800 companies not liable to the top-up taxes referred to in (a) above, the proposed tax system is not in fact an overall corporation tax on business profits but a combination of various individual taxes (payroll tax, business property occupation tax, registration fee) subject to ceilings which render the tax liability extremely small or non-existent (it is not for nothing that the proposal is referred to in Gibraltar as “zero rate tax”).", "Bearing in mind that most of the 28 800 companies registered can be regarded as letterbox or asset management companies, provided that these companies generated profits they would be liable to GBP 3 000 per employee per year.", "Since most of them will have only one employee (an accountant or auditor), usually part-time, they would pay only a maximum of GBP 3 000 per year in tax if they do not occupy property (which is usually the case), because they would not then have to pay the [BPOT];", "…", "(d) Offshore companies would remain outside the scope of two of the new taxes: around 8 000 companies without any physical presence in Gibraltar would thus be exempt;", "…", "This is a tax reform which comprises a wide range of peculiarities and leaves intact the tax situation of businesses with no staff or premises in Gibraltar.", "…’", "18 The Commission forwarded those observations to the United Kingdom, which sent its own comments to the Commission by letter of 13 February 2003 but did not adopt a position on the Kingdom of Spain’s arguments concerning the tax treatment of offshore companies.", "19 In recital 163 of the contested decision, the Commission concluded that ‘[the proposed tax reform] constitutes a scheme of State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty.", "None of the derogations provided for in Article 87(2) or Article 87(3) apply.", "Therefore the United Kingdom is not authorised to implement the reform.’", "20 According to the Commission, as is apparent from recitals 98 to 152 of the contested decision, the proposed tax reform is both regionally and materially selective.", "It is regionally selective since it provides for a system of corporate taxation under which companies in Gibraltar are taxed, in general, at a lower rate than those in the United Kingdom (recital 127 of the contested decision).", "21 The Commission finds that certain aspects of the proposed tax reform are materially selective.", "Thus, the following are selective from that viewpoint: first, the requirement to make a profit before incurring liability to payroll tax and BPOT, since that requirement favours companies which make no profit (recitals 128 to 133 of the contested decision), and second, the cap limiting liability to payroll tax and BPOT to 15% of profits, since that cap favours companies which, for the tax year in question, have profits that are low in relation to the number of employees and occupation of business property (recitals 134 to 141 of the contested decision).", "Third and lastly, imposition of a payroll tax and BPOT is also materially selective, since both taxes inherently favour offshore companies which have no real physical presence in Gibraltar and which as a consequence do not incur corporate tax (recitals 142 to 144 and 147 to 151 of the contested decision).", "22 Article 1 of the operative part of the contested decision provides:", "‘The proposals notified by the United Kingdom for the reform of the system of corporate taxation in Gibraltar constitute a scheme of State aid that is incompatible with the common market.", "Those proposals may accordingly not be implemented.’", "IV – The proceedings at first instance and the judgment under appeal", "23 By applications lodged at the Court Registry on 9 June 2004, the Government of Gibraltar, in Case T-211/04, and the United Kingdom, in Case T‑215/04, each brought an action for annulment of the contested decision.", "24 Those applicants essentially put forward three identical pleas in law in each of the cases.", "The first and second pleas relate to errors of law and assessment regarding, respectively, application of the criterion of regional selectivity and the criterion of material selectivity.", "The third plea relates to breach of essential procedural requirements in the context of investigation of the third aspect of the proposed tax reform, concerning offshore companies.", "The latter plea subdivides into two parts, of which the first, concerning breach of the right to a fair hearing, is put forward by both the United Kingdom and the Government of Gibraltar, and the second, concerning an error in the statement of reasons, is put forward only by the Government of Gibraltar.", "25 By orders of the President of the Third Chamber of the General Court of 14 December 2004 and 15 February 2005, leave was granted to the United Kingdom to intervene in support of the form of order sought by the Government of Gibraltar in Case T‑211/04, and to the Kingdom of Spain to intervene in support of the form of order sought by the Commission in Case T‑215/04.", "26 The General Court upheld the applicants’ first plea relating to regional selectivity and also the second plea relating to material selectivity.", "As a result, the Court did not examine the third plea alleging breach of essential procedural requirements.", "V – Procedure before the Court of Justice and forms of order sought", "27 By order of the President of the Court of 26 June 2009, Cases C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P were joined for the purposes of the written and oral procedure and of the judgment.", "28 By order of the President of the Court of 25 September 2009, Ireland was granted leave to intervene in the present cases in support of the forms of order sought by the United Kingdom and the Government of Gibraltar.", "29 In its appeal, the Commission claims that the Court should:", "– primarily:", "– set aside the judgment under appeal;", "– dismiss the applications for annulment lodged by the Government of Gibraltar and by the United Kingdom; and", "– order the Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom to pay the costs;", "– in the alternative:", "– refer the cases back to the General Court for reconsideration; and", "– reserve the costs of the proceedings at first instance and on appeal.", "30 In its appeal, the Kingdom of Spain claims that the Court should:", "– set aside the judgment under appeal;", "– declare the contested decision to be lawful; and", "– order the respondents to pay the costs.", "31 The Government of Gibraltar contends that the Court should:", "– dismiss the appeals brought by the Commission and the Kingdom of Spain; and", "– order the Commission and the Kingdom of Spain to pay the costs of the Government of Gibraltar.", "32 The United Kingdom contends that the Court should:", "– dismiss the appeals brought by the Commission and the Kingdom of Spain; and", "– order the Commission and the Kingdom of Spain to pay the costs.", "33 Ireland contends that the Court should:", "– dismiss the appeal brought by the Commission; and", "– order the Commission to pay the costs.", "VI – The appeals", "34 The Commission puts forward a single ground of appeal, alleging infringement of Article 87(1) EC.", "That ground, relating to the General Court’s conclusions with regard to material selectivity of the proposed tax reform, is divided into six parts.", "The Kingdom of Spain puts forward 11 grounds of appeal, which may be divided into 3 groups, relating, first, to the regional selectivity of that proposal and to the status of Gibraltar (the first 7 grounds and the 9th ground), secondly, to material selectivity (the 8th ground) and, lastly, to the proceedings before the General Court (the 10th and 11th grounds).", "35 It is appropriate to examine first of all the grounds of appeal relating to material selectivity, that is to say, the single ground put forward by the Commission and the eighth ground put forward by the Kingdom of Spain.", "A – The Commission’s single ground of appeal and the eighth ground of appeal of the Kingdom of Spain", "1.", "Grounds of the judgment under appeal", "36 Before examining the contested decision, the General Court sets out in paragraphs 143 to 146 of the judgment under appeal the analytical framework to be observed by the Commission when considering whether a scheme of tax aid is selective.", "In that regard, the General Court considers that classification by the Commission of a tax measure as selective necessarily means that it begins by identifying the ‘normal’ regime under the tax system.", "In relation to this ‘normal’ tax regime, the Commission must, secondly, assess and determine whether any advantage granted by the tax measure at issue is selective, by demonstrating that the measure derogates from that ‘normal’ regime.", "In a third stage it is necessary to assess whether, in the event of such derogations, the measure leading to differentiation between undertakings may none the less not be ‘selective’, when the differentiation arises from the nature or general scheme of the system of charges of which it forms part.", "37 The General Court states that the Commission cannot omit those first two stages of the review of the selectivity of the measure in question, as otherwise the Commission would be assuming the role of the Member State with regard to determining that State’s tax system and the ‘normal’ regime under that system.", "With regard to determining the tax system at issue, the General Court considers that, as European Union law currently stands, direct taxation falls within the competence of the Member States.", "Thus it is solely the latter, and infra-State bodies having fiscal autonomy, that have competence to devise the systems of corporate taxation which they consider the best suited to the needs of their economies.", "38 In paragraph 148 of the judgment under appeal, the Court recalls that in the contested decision ‘the Commission concluded that three aspects of the tax system introduced by the [proposed tax reform] confer selective advantages on the companies benefiting therefrom and may therefore constitute State aid, namely (i) the requirement that a company must make a profit before it becomes liable to payroll tax and BPOT, (ii) the cap limiting liability to payroll tax and BPOT to 15% of profits and (iii) the inherent nature of the payroll tax and BPOT’.", "39 Next the Court examines the contested decision in the light of the analytical framework set out in paragraphs 143 to 146 of the judgment under appeal.", "40 In that regard, the Court finds, in paragraph 170 of the judgment under appeal, that, in the light of the explanations provided by the Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, according to which the elements of the proposed tax reform together constitute a tax system in its own right which should be treated as being the ‘normal’ tax regime, ‘the Commission could not forgo performance of its duty, as described in paragraph 143 [of the judgment under appeal], to begin by identifying the … “normal” regime under the notified tax system and, if necessary, to challenge the Gibraltar authorities’ description of that regime’.", "The Court holds, in paragraphs 171 to 174 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission failed to follow the stages of that analytical framework and thereby, in the light of the competence of States in tax matters, went beyond the limits of its review.", "41 Furthermore, the Court also states, in paragraph 175 of the judgment under appeal, that, ‘apart from the Commission’s failure … to observe the analytical framework relating to the determination of selectivity, neither the considerations set out in the contested decision … nor the arguments put forward by the Commission and the Kingdom of Spain in the course of the … proceedings are sufficient to call into question the validity of the definition of the … “normal” regime under the notified tax system’.", "42 In this connection, the Court holds, first, in paragraphs 176 to 178 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission has not succeeded in demonstrating that the condition for tax liability, namely that a company must make a profit, and the capping of tax at 15% of profits are to be regarded as derogations and that the tax regime must therefore be regarded as selective.", "43 Second, the Court finds, in paragraphs 179 to 181 of the judgment under appeal, that neither the fact that the Commission considers that tax system to be ‘hybrid’ nor the fact that an undertaking which does not have a ‘physical presence’ in Gibraltar is not liable to payroll tax and BPOT is sufficient to demonstrate that the tax regime in question is selective.", "44 Third, according to paragraphs 182 to 184 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s comments regarding the various criteria adopted under the regime at issue in order to determine an undertaking’s tax liability are too vague to cast doubt on the Gibraltar authorities’ definition of what constitutes the ‘normal’ regime under the proposed tax reform.", "45 The Court concludes, in paragraph 185 of the judgment under appeal, that none of the aspects of the proposed tax reform identified by the Commission can be considered to confer a selective advantage for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC, since the Commission has not demonstrated to the requisite legal standard that they constitute derogations from the ‘normal’ tax regime.", "46 Lastly, the Court states, in paragraph 186 of the judgment under appeal, ‘that the comparison of the alleged effects of the tax system introduced by the [proposed tax] reform with the effects of the tax system preceding it, as drawn by the Commission in Table 1 and recital 150 of the contested decision, cannot be accepted in this instance for the purposes of applying Article 87(1) EC’.", "2.", "Arguments of the parties", "47 In its appeal, the Commission puts forward a single ground of appeal, alleging infringement of Article 87(1) EC and based on the General Court’s examination of material selectivity.", "This ground is divided into six parts.", "48 In the first part of this ground of appeal the Commission claims that the General Court erred in assessing the relationship between Article 87(1) EC and the scope of the competence of the Member States in tax matters.", "The Commission considers in that respect that the powers of Member States with regard to tax matters are subject to the constraints imposed by European Union law, in particular by Article 87(1) EC, and that the mere fact that a national rule falls within the area of tax law does not mean that it does not have to comply with Article 87 EC, since that article defines State measures not by reference to their causes or aims but in relation to their effects.", "49 In the second part of its single ground of appeal the Commission claims that the General Court erroneously held that the Commission was obliged first to identify the ‘normal’ regime under the tax system contained in the proposed reform and then to demonstrate that the measures in question derogated from that regime.", "Such an approach disregards the possibility that a Member State may introduce a tax system which is inherently discriminatory by its very structure.", "Through judicious selection of the criteria to be applied in its allegedly ‘normal’ system of taxation, Gibraltar produced to a large extent the effects of a scheme which manifestly incorporates State aid for certain categories of undertaking.", "50 In the third part of its single ground of appeal the Commission claims that the General Court infringed the principles relating to the interpretation of the concept of State aid, according to which national measures must be assessed on the basis of their effects and not in the light of the objective pursued or a certain regulatory technique.", "51 In the fourth part of this ground of appeal the Commission maintains that the approach adopted by the Court leads to the outcome that all the features of a tax system, no matter how much they favour certain beneficiaries, are automatically part of that system, not a derogation, and therefore escape the application of State aid rules.", "52 In the fifth part of this ground of appeal the Commission complains that the Court wrongly held that the Commission had failed both to identify the ‘normal’ tax regime and to demonstrate that specific features of the proposed tax reform constituted derogations from that system.", "In fact, the Commission clearly and consistently identified the notified tax system as being based on the taxation of labour and of the occupation of business property.", "Also the Commission notes that the ground on which the Court annulled the contested decision is based not on a lack of reasoning but on an error of law.", "53 In the sixth part of its single ground of appeal the Commission claims that the Court failed to assess the three elements of selectivity identified in the contested decision, by not examining the Commission’s findings concerning the concrete effects of the proposed tax reform, namely that it produces different taxation levels for different sectors of the Gibraltar economy and confers a selective advantage on offshore undertakings, which have no employees and occupy no property in Gibraltar.", "54 Even though the Court did reproduce the relevant parts of the contested decision in paragraphs 156 to 162 of the judgment under appeal, it did not take any position on the selective aspects of the proposed tax reform thus identified.", "The Court failed to acknowledge, in paragraph 186 of the judgment under appeal, the relevance of the comparison of the proposed tax reform with the previous tax system.", "It should be pointed out that the Commission had noted, referring to the previous system, that the scheme examined in the contested decision sought to perpetuate the previous situation, producing the same effects although using a different technique.", "Thus the Court’s approach gives decisive weight to fiscal technique over an assessment in the light of a measure’s effects.", "55 The Kingdom of Spain claims, in its eighth ground of appeal, that the General Court was wrong to hold that the criterion of material selectivity was not satisfied.", "The vast majority of undertakings established in Gibraltar (28 798 of the 29 000 companies) may end up with a zero rate of taxation.", "Consequently, the regime classified by the Court as being general is in fact a special regime creating ‘de facto selectivity’.", "56 In its response to the Commission’s appeal, the Kingdom of Spain supports the ground of appeal put forward by the Commission.", "It states that the real objective pursued by the proposed tax reform is to continue to attract foreign capital the holders of which are seeking to avoid the normal tax systems to which they would be subject in their country of origin.", "Moreover, since the analysis of a corporate tax is an exercise requiring a complex economic assessment, the Court was wrong to replace the Commission’s economic assessment with its own assessment with regard to the selective elements identified by the Commission in the contested decision.", "57 The Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom maintain, first of all, that the Court was right to reject the approach taken by the Commission in the contested decision.", "That approach is incorrect and is opposite to the approach normally taken by the Commission, as contained in particular in the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation.", "That new approach would lead to the removal of the fiscal sovereignty enjoyed by Member States under the EC Treaty and under the consistent case-law of the Court of Justice and would open the door to harmonisation of direct taxation by the Commission.", "58 As regards the first part of the Commission’s single ground of appeal, the Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom consider that it challenges Member States’ competence in tax matters and is based on a misreading of the judgment under appeal in that the Court did not disregard the limitation of the fiscal sovereignty of Member States by European Union law.", "59 They submit likewise that, in its argument in support of the second part of the single ground of appeal the Commission challenges the fiscal sovereignty of Member States.", "The mere fact that a tax regime creates an advantage for some companies is not sufficient in itself for that regime to be regarded as selective, since it is necessary first of all to identify the normal regime.", "That is corroborated by the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation, which is binding on the Commission in accordance with the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations.", "60 In the third part of its single ground of appeal the Commission also misreads the judgment under appeal in claiming that the Court held that the Commission should take into account the objectives claimed by the national or regional authorities rather than examine the actual content of the rules at issue.", "61 The Commission’s argument, in the fourth part of its single ground of appeal, that a ‘normal’ tax system may not apply more than one tax criterion is also irreconcilable with the fiscal sovereignty of Member States.", "Member States should be free to adopt the taxes that they consider most appropriate for their needs and to choose whatever basis of assessment they wish, including in their tax rules the normal and necessary provisions concerning the ability of taxpayers to pay that are a common feature of taxes.", "The fact that a tax regime meets more than one objective is completely legitimate.", "62 Also, the argument underlying the fifth part of the Commission’s single ground of appeal is incorrect.", "There is nothing inconsistent in a tax system based on the use of more than one basis of assessment that also includes provisions about tax payers’ ability to pay.", "Moreover, the Commission’s assertion that it performed a three-step analysis is incorrect.", "63 Lastly, with regard to the sixth part of the single ground of appeal, the Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom maintain that the Commission’s argument that the tax system is to be regarded as selective since the ‘offshore’ economy is not taxed is incorrect.", "In every tax system, companies that do not have a tax base as defined by the national tax system do not pay tax under that system.", "Thus, the Commission’s argument amounts to imposing on Member States, despite their fiscal sovereignty, the Commission’s view as to which basis of assessment is appropriate.", "The mere fact that different companies may pay different amounts of tax is not sufficient to establish that the proposed tax reform is selective.", "64 With regard to the eighth ground of appeal put forward by the Kingdom of Spain, concerning the material selectivity of the proposed tax reform, the Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom submit, first of all, that the mere fact that some companies do not pay tax is not sufficient to conclude that their tax treatment is selective and to consider that those companies receive State aid.", "Moreover, determining the elements that constitute the tax base is a matter that falls within the fiscal sovereignty of Member States.", "The tax authorities are in particular not obliged to use either revenue or profit as a basis of assessment.", "Also, the Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom submit that the three-step assessment of a tax measure, as provided for in the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation and adopted by the Court in the judgment under appeal, is necessary in order to identify the selective advantages procured by that measure.", "Lastly, as regards the Kingdom of Spain’s statement that 28 798 of the 29 000 companies established in Gibraltar may, as a result of the proposed tax reform, end up with a ‘zero rate’ of taxation, the United Kingdom doubts whether those figures are accurate.", "The Government of Gibraltar, without taking a specific position on the Kingdom of Spain’s statement, contends that it is difficult to estimate how many companies would remain established in Gibraltar when the proposed tax reform is introduced, and points out in its response that, currently, out of the 24 000 companies registered in Gibraltar, around 3 000 are ‘exempt’ companies under the former tax regime, approximately 260 are utility or financial services companies and 18 000 are inactive companies holding assets.", "65 Ireland, intervening in support of the form of order sought by the United Kingdom in Case C-106/09 P, submits that the Commission’s appeal should be declared inadmissible to the extent that it goes beyond the scope of both the contested decision and the judgment under appeal.", "Ireland considers that, in the first part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission seeks to impose on Member States the burden of proof as regards demonstrating that the nature and structure of their tax systems are compliant with European Union law.", "Moreover, it observes that the Commission seeks to base its arguments in this regard on the principle of non‑discrimination, whereas the rules on State aid do not find their origin in that principle but in the concept of fair competition in the common market.", "With regard to the other parts of the Commission’s single ground of appeal, Ireland contends that the Commission is bound, in accordance with the principles of legal certainty and legitimate expectations, by its notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation.", "To regard a tax system as being inherently discriminatory by reason of its effects, without being able to identify a normal rate of tax, would conflict with established case-law and the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States.", "Moreover, it is not sufficient, in particular, to classify a tax system as ‘hybrid’ and conclude from this that undertakings treated favourably under that system are in receipt of State aid.", "3.", "Findings of the Court", "66 Contrary to what Ireland contends, the Commission’s single ground of appeal is admissible since, in accordance with Article 113 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, it seeks to set aside the judgment under appeal without seeking to change the subject-matter of the proceedings before the General Court.", "To that end, the Commission complains that the General Court infringed Article 87 EC in that it wrongly held that none of the three elements identified in the contested decision as being selective confers selective advantages.", "67 It is necessary to reject from the outset the Commission’s complaint, contained in the second part of its single ground of appeal, by which it alleges that the General Court wrongly relied on the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation, the content of which it misconstrued.", "68 Having regard to the reference, in paragraphs 143 and 146 of the judgment under appeal, to that notice, suffice it to state that the General Court did not draw any factual or legal conclusion from it, as is apparent from the use of the words ‘[a]s the Commission itself states’ and ‘[f]urthermore’ in those paragraphs, but relied, in order to substantiate its approach as set out in paragraphs 143 to 146 of the judgment under appeal, on the case-law of the Court of Justice and the allocation of competence in tax matters between the European Union and the Member States.", "69 In those circumstances, the Commission’s complaint against that reference to the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation is ineffective (see, to that effect, Case C-182/99 P Salzgitter v Commission [2003] ECR I-10761, paragraphs 54 and 55), and so it is unnecessary to consider the content and scope of that notice at this stage.", "70 In order to examine the Commission’s single ground of appeal and the Kingdom of Spain’s eighth ground of appeal it is appropriate to recall the case-law of the Court of Justice relating to the concept of selective advantage in tax matters.", "71 According to settled case-law, the definition of aid is more general than that of a subsidy, given that it includes not only positive benefits, such as subsidies themselves, but also State measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which thus, without being subsidies in the strict sense of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect (see Case C-143/99 Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke [2001] ECR I-8365, paragraph 38, and Joined Cases C‑78/08 to C-80/08 Paint Graphos and Others [2011] ECR I‑0000, paragraph 45 and the case-law cited).", "72 Consequently, a measure by which the public authorities grant certain undertakings favourable tax treatment which, although not involving the transfer of State resources, places the recipients in a more favourable financial position than other taxpayers amounts to State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (see Case C-387/92 Banco Exterior de España [1994] ECR I-877, paragraph 14, and Paint Graphos and Others, paragraph 46 and the case-law cited).", "73 On the other hand, advantages resulting from a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators do not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87 EC (see, to that effect, Case C‑156/98 Germany v Commission [2000] ECR I‑6857, paragraph 22, and Joined Cases C‑393/04 and C‑41/05 Air Liquide Industries Belgium [2006] ECR I‑5293, paragraph 32 and the case-law cited).", "74 It is therefore necessary to determine whether the proposed tax reform is selective, selectivity being a constituent factor in the concept of State aid (see Case C‑88/03 Portugal v Commission [2006] ECR I‑7115, paragraph 54).", "75 As regards appraisal of the condition of selectivity, it is clear from settled case-law that Article 87(1) EC requires assessment of whether, under a particular legal regime, a national measure is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ in comparison with others which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation (Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke, paragraph 41, and Case C‑487/06 P British Aggregates v Commission [2008] ECR I‑10515, paragraph 82 and the case-law cited).", "76 In the light of that case-law, it should be considered whether the General Court infringed Article 87(1) EC, as interpreted by the Court of Justice, in ruling that none of the three elements identified in the contested decision confers selective advantages.", "(a) The requirement to make a profit and the capping of tax", "77 The General Court concluded with regard to the first two selective elements of the measure at issue that were identified in the contested decision, namely the fact that payroll tax and BPOT are payable only where the taxable person makes a profit and that the amount of tax is capped in respect of both those bases of assessment at 15% of the profits, that the Commission had not succeeded in demonstrating that those elements confer selective advantages.", "78 That conclusion of the General Court is not vitiated by an error of law.", "79 As was noted in paragraph 73 above, only selective advantages, and not advantages resulting from a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators, fall within the concept of State aid.", "80 The requirement to make a profit and the capping of taxation of profits are per se general measures applicable without distinction to all economic operators and are therefore not liable to confer selective advantages.", "81 The Commission’s contention that the profit criterion is alien to the inherent logic of a system of taxation founded on the payroll tax and BPOT does not mean that that criterion, which is in itself neutral, becomes selective.", "82 The General Court committed no error in law in ruling that the requirement to make a profit and the capping of tax at 15% of profits do not confer selective advantages.", "83 The advantages alleged by the Commission resulting from measures applicable without distinction to all economic operators, namely the requirement to make a profit, which would benefit unprofitable operators, and those resulting from the capping of tax, which would benefit very profitable operators, do not mean that the tax regime under consideration can be regarded as entailing selective effects.", "Those effects are not such that they favour ‘certain undertakings’ or ‘the production of certain goods’ within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, but are merely the consequence of the random event that the undertaking in question is unprofitable or very profitable during the period of assessment.", "84 It follows from the foregoing that the complaints against the General Court’s conclusion that the Commission did not succeed in demonstrating that the first two elements identified in the contested decision, namely the requirement to make a profit and the capping of tax at 15% of profits, confer selective advantages must be rejected.", "(b) Advantages accruing to offshore companies", "85 The General Court concluded, in paragraph 185 of the judgment under appeal, that there are no selective advantages for offshore companies.", "It found that the Commission, having failed to observe the analytical framework relating to the determination of the tax measure’s selectivity, as outlined in paragraphs 143 to 146 of the judgment under appeal and referred to in paragraphs 36 and 37 above, did not succeed in demonstrating that offshore companies, which by their nature have no physical presence in Gibraltar, enjoy selective advantages.", "86 That reasoning is vitiated by an error of law.", "87 First, it is appropriate to recall that the Court has consistently held that Article 87(1) EC does not distinguish between measures of State intervention by reference to their causes or their aims but defines them in relation to their effects, and thus independently of the techniques used (see British Aggregates v Commission, paragraphs 85 and 89 and the case-law cited, and Case C‑279/08 P Commission v Netherlands [2011] ECR I‑0000, paragraph 51).", "88 The General Court’s approach, based solely on a regard for the regulatory technique used by the proposed tax reform, does not allow the effects of the tax measure in question to be considered and excludes from the outset any possibility that the fact that no tax liability is incurred by offshore companies may be classified as a ‘selective advantage’.", "That approach is therefore at variance with the case-law cited in paragraph 87 above.", "89 Secondly, the General Court’s approach also disregards the case-law cited in paragraph 71 above, according to which the existence of a selective advantage for an undertaking entails mitigation of the charges which are normally included in its budget.", "90 The Court admittedly held in paragraph 56 of Portugal v Commission that the determination of the reference framework has a particular importance in the case of tax measures, since the very existence of an advantage may be established only when compared with ‘normal’ taxation.", "91 However, contrary to the General Court’s reasoning and the proposition put forward by the Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, that case-law does not make the classification of a tax system as ‘selective’ conditional upon that system being designed in such a way that undertakings which might enjoy a selective advantage are, in general, liable to the same tax burden as other undertakings but benefit from derogating provisions, so that the selective advantage may be identified as being the difference between the normal tax burden and that borne by those former undertakings .", "92 Such an interpretation of the selectivity criterion would require, contrary to the case-law cited in paragraph 87 above, that in order for a tax system to be classifiable as ‘selective’ it must be designed in accordance with a certain regulatory technique; the consequence of this would be that national tax rules fall from the outset outside the scope of control of State aid merely because they were adopted under a different regulatory technique although they produce the same effects in law and/or in fact.", "93 Those considerations apply particularly with regard to a tax system which, as in the present case, instead of laying down general rules applying to all undertakings from which a derogation is made for certain undertakings, achieves the same result by adjusting and combining the tax rules in such a way that their very application results in a different tax burden for different undertakings.", "94 Thirdly, the General Court was wrong in criticising the Commission, in paragraphs 184 to 186 of the judgment under appeal, for not demonstrating the existence of a selective advantage for offshore companies, having failed to identify in the contested decision a reference framework for establishing the existence of a selective advantage.", "95 It should be noted in that respect that, contrary to what the General Court held with regard to recitals 143, 144 and 150 of the contested decision, it is apparent from those recitals that the Commission examined the existence of selective advantages for offshore companies in the light of the tax regime at issue, which formally applies to all undertakings.", "It is thus apparent that the contested decision identifies that regime as a reference framework in relation to which offshore companies are, in fact, favoured.", "96 Lastly, the Commission, contrary to what the General Court held, did demonstrate to the requisite legal standard in the contested decision that offshore companies enjoy, in the light of that reference framework, selective advantages within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 75 above.", "97 It is true that, in the absence of European Union rules governing the matter, it falls within the competence of the Member States, or of infra‑State bodies having fiscal autonomy, to designate bases of assessment and to spread the tax burden across the different factors of production and economic sectors, as the General Court held in paragraph 146 of the judgment under appeal.", "98 However, the General Court failed to assess the regime at issue as a whole and did not take into account the factors on which the Commission based its assessment of the regime at issue in the contested decision.", "99 In that respect, it is necessary to recall the permanent features of the regime at issue as described in paragraphs 21 to 25 of the judgment under appeal.", "100 The features of that regime are, first, a combination of the payroll tax and BPOT as the sole bases of assessment, together with the requirement to make a profit, the tax on which is capped at 15%, and second, the absence of a generally applicable basis of assessment providing for the taxation of all companies covered by that regime.", "101 In view of the features of that regime, outlined in the preceding paragraph, it is apparent that the regime at issue, by combining those bases, even though they are founded on criteria that are in themselves of a general nature, in practice discriminates between companies which are in a comparable situation with regard to the objective of the proposed tax reform, namely to introduce a general system of taxation for all companies established in Gibraltar .", "102 Combining those bases of assessment not only results in taxation according to the number of employees and the size of the business premises occupied, but also, due to the absence of other bases of assessment, excludes from the outset any taxation of offshore companies, since they have no employees and also do not occupy business property.", "103 Admittedly, according to the case-law cited in paragraph 73 above, a different tax burden resulting from the application of a ‘general’ tax regime is not sufficient on its own to establish the selectivity of taxation for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC.", "104 Thus, the criteria forming the basis of assessment which are adopted by a tax system must also, in order to be capable of being recognised as conferring selective advantages, be such as to characterise the recipient undertakings, by virtue of the properties which are specific to them, as a privileged category, thus permitting such a regime to be described as favouring ‘certain’ undertakings or the production of ‘certain’ goods within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC.", "105 That is specifically the case here.", "106 In that regard, it should be observed that the fact that offshore companies are not taxed is not a random consequence of the regime at issue, but the inevitable consequence of the fact that the bases of assessment are specifically designed so that offshore companies, which by their nature have no employees and do not occupy business premises, have no tax base under the bases of assessment adopted in the proposed tax reform.", "107 Thus, the fact that offshore companies, which constitute a group of companies with regard to the bases of assessment adopted in the proposed tax reform, avoid taxation precisely on account of the specific features characteristic of that group gives reason to conclude that those companies enjoy selective advantages.", "108 It follows from all the foregoing that the General Court erred in law in finding that the proposed tax reform does not confer selective advantages, for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC, on offshore companies.", "109 Consequently, the Commission’s single ground of appeal and the eighth ground of appeal of the Kingdom of Spain are well founded on this point, and so the judgment under appeal must be set aside on that basis.", "110 It follows that there is no longer any need to examine the Kingdom of Spain’s first seven grounds of appeal or its ninth ground of appeal, relating to regional selectivity and to the status of Gibraltar.", "Nor is it necessary to examine the Kingdom of Spain’s 10th and 11th grounds of appeal, relating to the proceedings before the General Court.", "VII – The actions before the General Court", "111 As provided in the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the Court of Justice, when it quashes the decision of the General Court, may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.", "112 In the circumstances, the Court considers that the actions for annulment of the contested decision brought by the applicants at first instance are ready for judgment and that final judgment should be given on them.", "113 It is appropriate, therefore, to consider the actions brought before the General Court by the Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom.", "114 The applicants at first instance essentially put forward three pleas in law.", "The first plea and the second plea, which subdivides into three parts, allege errors concerning application of the criteria of regional and material selectivity respectively.", "The third plea alleges breach of essential procedural requirements in the context of the Commission’s investigation with regard to offshore companies.", "That plea is subdivided into two parts, of which the first, concerning breach of the rights of the defence, is put forward both by the Government of Gibraltar and by the United Kingdom and the second, concerning an error in the statement of reasons, is put forward solely by the Government of Gibraltar.", "115 It is appropriate to deal first with the three parts of the second plea, concerning material selectivity, and the second part of the Government of Gibraltar’s third plea, also concerning a matter relating to material selectivity.", "The first part of the third plea, relating to the rights of defence, must be examined second.", "Lastly, a ruling must be given on the first plea, relating to regional selectivity.", "A – The second plea of the Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, and the second part of the Government of Gibraltar’s third plea", "116 The second plea put forward by the applicants at first instance, relating to material selectivity, comprises three parts.", "By the first part, the applicants complain that the Commission departed from its decision‑making practice and from the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation.", "By the second part, which is the only part on which the General Court gave a ruling in the judgment under appeal, the applicants claim that none of the three elements identified in the contested decision confers selective advantages.", "Lastly, the third part seeks to demonstrate that that decision disregarded the fact that any selective advantages are, in any event, justified by the nature and general scheme of the tax system at issue.", "By the second part of its third plea, the Government of Gibraltar alleges an error in the statement of reasons for the contested decision.", "1.", "The second part of the second plea", "117 With regard to the complaints raised in the second part of the second plea, relating to the classification of the three elements identified in the contested decision, it is apparent from the considerations set out in paragraphs 86 to 110 above that the Commission does not infringe Article 87(1) EC in finding, in the contested decision, that the tax regime at issue confers selective advantages.", "118 Although it is clear from paragraphs 77 to 84 above that the General Court did not err in law in concluding that the first two elements identified in the contested decision, namely the requirement to make a profit and the capping of tax at 15% of profits, do not confer selective advantages, the fact remains that the Commission was correct in finding, as regards the third element identified in the contested decision, concerning the tax treatment of offshore companies, that such companies do enjoy such advantages.", "119 While, according to the contested decision, the tax regime at issue confers selective advantages, that conclusion is justified to a sufficient legal standard by the existence of selective advantages for offshore companies, without it being necessary in addition that the other two elements identified in that decision as being selective also confer selective advantages (see, to that effect, Case C-66/02 Italy v Commission [2005] ECR I‑10901, paragraph 98).", "Consequently, the second part of the second plea is ineffective.", "120 The second part of the second plea put forward by the Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom at first instance against the contested decision must therefore be rejected.", "2.", "The second part of the third plea, put forward by the Government of Gibraltar", "121 It is necessary to reject from the outset the second part of the Government of Gibraltar’s third plea, which alleges an error in the reasoning in that the Commission did not state which companies constitute the ‘large offshore sector’ referred to by recital 143 of the contested decision, failing to identify an individual company, a number of individual companies or an economic sector that would allegedly benefit from the proposed tax reform.", "122 In that connection, it is sufficient to note that the Court of Justice has consistently held that the Commission may, in the case of an aid scheme, confine itself to examining the general characteristics of the scheme in question, without being required to examine each particular case in which it applies, in order to determine whether that scheme comprises aid elements (Joined Cases C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P Comitato ‘Venezia vuole vivere’ and Others v Commission [2011] ECR I‑0000, paragraph 130 and the case-law cited).", "3.", "The first part of the second plea", "(a) Arguments of the parties", "123 By the first part of their second plea, the applicants at first instance complain that in the contested decision the Commission departed from the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation.", "The Government of Gibraltar also claims that the decision is not consistent with the Commission’s decision-making practice.", "124 As regards the purport of the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation, the applicants submit that it is clear from paragraph 13 of that notice that Member States have the power to decide on the economic policy which they consider most appropriate and, in particular, to spread the tax burden as they see fit across the different factors of production.", "Moreover, according to paragraphs 9 and 16 of the notice, it is necessary for the Commission to establish that a tax measure provides, in favour of certain undertakings in the Member States, an exception to the application of the tax system, which means that the common system applicable, from which a derogation is then made, must first be determined.", "Lastly, according to paragraph 14 of the notice, the fact that some firms or some sectors benefit more than others from a particular tax measure does not mean that the measure is caught by the State aid rules.", "125 The approach taken by the Commission in the contested decision with regard to the advantages enjoyed by offshore companies is inconsistent with the guidance contained in that notice.", "By departing from the notice, the Commission infringed the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations.", "126 In support of the complaint, raised solely by the Government of Gibraltar, that the Commission introduced a new material selectivity principle which was not consistent with its previous decision-making practice, the Government of Gibraltar lists several Commission decisions.", "127 The Commission contends that the applicants at first instance misread the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation.", "It also contends that it has not derogated from its decision-making practice and that the approach taken in the contested decision is consistent with the case-law of the Court of Justice.", "(b) Findings of the Court", "128 With regard, first, to the complaint that, in the contested decision, the Commission departed from the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation, it should be observed that that notice, which, being an internal measure adopted by the administration, cannot be regarded as a rule of law, nevertheless forms rules of practice from which the administration may not depart in an individual case without giving reasons which are compatible with the principle of equal treatment (see, with regard to the guidelines on State aid, the judgment of 9 June 2011 in Joined Cases C‑465/09 P to C‑470/09 P Diputación Foral de Vizcaya and Others v Commission, paragraph 120 and the case-law cited).", "129 Thus, it is necessary to consider whether the Commission did in fact depart from that notice, so far as the investigation of the selectivity of the scheme at issue was concerned.", "130 In that regard, it should be stated first of all that, contrary to what the applicants at first instance claim, paragraph 13 of that notice cannot be construed as exempting the power of Member States to spread the tax burden across the different factors of production from all scrutiny under the rules on State aid.", "Paragraph 13 merely explains that ‘[t]ax measures which are open to all economic agents’ do not constitute State aid, whilst, in the present case, the tax advantages enjoyed by offshore companies are not in fact open to all economic agents, as is clear from paragraph 102 above.", "131 Also, as regards paragraphs 9 and 16 of the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation, it should be pointed out that, contrary to what the applicants at first instance claim, it does not follow from those paragraphs that the existence of an advantage can be shown only by establishing a derogation from a normal tax regime.", "132 Paragraph 9 only gives examples of selective advantages which are common.", "Paragraph 16 explains that advantages resulting from an apparently general measure may none the less be recognised as being selective.", "This finding is supported by paragraph 13 of the notice, which is the first paragraph to address the distinction between State aid and general measures and which clearly states that the latter must be ‘effectively open to all firms on an equal access basis, and [that] they may not de facto be reduced in scope’.", "133 Lastly, the argument put forward by the applicants at first instance that the Commission departed from the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation is not supported by paragraph 14 of that notice either.", "It is already clear from the words ‘does not necessarily mean that they are caught by the competition rules governing State aid’ that that paragraph is not intended to exclude certain measures categorically from application of the rules on State aid.", "134 Therefore, the complaint that, in the contested decision, the Commission departed from the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation must be rejected.", "135 Secondly, the Government of Gibraltar’s complaint that, in the contested decision, the Commission departed from its decision-making practice must be rejected.", "136 In that regard, it is sufficient to observe that, according to case-law, the question whether a measure constitutes State aid must be assessed solely in the context of Article 87(1) EC and not in the light of an alleged earlier decision-making practice of the Commission (see, to that effect, the judgment of 21 July 2011 in Case C‑459/10 P Freistaat Sachsen and Land Sachsen-Anhalt v Commission, paragraph 50).", "137 In the light of the foregoing, the first part of the second plea must be rejected.", "4.", "The third part of the second plea", "(a) Arguments of the parties", "138 By the third part of their second plea, the applicants at first instance claim in essence that the Commission infringed Article 87(1) EC by not considering that the selective advantage for offshore companies was justified by the nature and general scheme of the system.", "139 According to those parties, the features of the proposed tax reform are the result of a necessarily small tax administration in Gibraltar and of Gibraltar’s small tax base which imposes limitations that are unavoidable and inherent in the functioning and effectiveness of Gibraltar’s tax system.", "140 The use of employment and business property occupation as bases of assessment is the logical choice in the light of Gibraltar’s specific circumstances since such a tax regime will create a simple, easily‑verified tax which is cheap to collect and which is similar to other taxes which the small Gibraltar tax administration has experience in collecting.", "The Government of Gibraltar also argues that as a consequence of the proposed tax reform all trading companies will be taxed.", "The fact that non-trading companies, which merely hold assets, will not be taxed corresponds to the norm for tax systems.", "141 According to the Commission, supported by the Kingdom of Spain, the selective advantages enjoyed by offshore companies cannot be justified by the nature or general scheme of the proposed tax reform, since that reform consists, by its very nature, in the creation of a system which, de facto, introduces different rates of taxation for different types of undertakings.", "142 Although the proposed tax reform may represent a reasonable strategic choice by the Government of Gibraltar, it is none the less selective.", "Furthermore, the applicants at first instance do not explain to what extent it is necessary, in order to avoid the over-taxation of many small undertakings, to tax some of those undertakings and not others, without taking into account the ability of such undertakings to pay tax.", "Nor can the argument that the Government of Gibraltar needed to have a simple tax that could be verified effectively justify a large number of companies in Gibraltar being exempt from tax.", "(b) Findings of the Court", "143 In assessing the third part of the second plea put forward by the applicants at first instance, it is important to note that the contested decision does not deal with the question whether the advantage enjoyed by offshore companies might be justified by the nature and general scheme of the tax system.", "144 Thus, it must be considered whether the Commission should have adopted a position, in the contested decision, on whether the selective advantage enjoyed by offshore companies might be justified by the nature and general scheme of the tax system.", "145 According to well-established case-law, the concept of State aid does not refer to State measures which differentiate between undertakings and which are, therefore, prima facie selective where that differentiation arises from the nature or the general scheme of the system of which they form part (see, to that effect, inter alia, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke, paragraph 42; Portugal v Commission, paragraph 52; and British Aggregates v Commission, paragraph 83).", "146 It is for the Member State which has introduced such a differentiation between undertakings in relation to charges to show that it is actually justified by the nature and general scheme of the system in question (Case C‑159/01 Netherlands v Commission [2004] ECR I‑4461, paragraph 43, and Commission v Netherlands, paragraph 77).", "147 A Member State which seeks to be allowed to grant aid by way of derogation from the Treaty rules has a duty to collaborate with the Commission.", "In pursuance of that duty, it must in particular provide all the information necessary to enable the Commission to verify that the conditions for the derogation sought are fulfilled (see Case C‑364/90 Italy v Commission [1993] ECR I‑2097, paragraph 20, and Case C‑372/97 Italy v Commission [2004] ECR I‑3679, paragraph 81).", "148 Lastly, it should be noted that the Commission is required, in the interests of sound administration of the rules relating to State aid, to conduct a diligent and impartial examination of the evidence at its disposal (see, inter alia, Case C‑367/95 P Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France [1998] ECR I‑1719, paragraph 62).", "149 It should be pointed out in that regard, first, that the United Kingdom did not, either in the notification of the proposed tax reform or at the stage of its formal investigation, adduce any justification for the selective advantages enjoyed by offshore companies.", "It is common ground that when the proposed tax reform was formally investigated the United Kingdom did not adopt a position on the Kingdom of Spain’s arguments concerning those advantages.", "150 Secondly, nor did the applicants at first instance claim in their actions before the General Court that the Commission had at its disposal evidence on the basis of which it should have examined, in the contested decision, possible justification for the selective advantage enjoyed by offshore companies.", "151 Hence, it must be concluded that there was no reason for the Commission to examine whether the selective advantages enjoyed by offshore companies might be justified by the nature and general scheme of the tax system, so the Commission cannot be criticised for not having addressed that point in the contested decision.", "152 In those circumstances, it is necessary to reject the argument put forward by the applicants at first instance that the Commission infringed Article 87(1) EC by not considering that the selective advantage for offshore companies was justified by the nature and general scheme of the system.", "153 Accordingly, the third part of the second plea must be rejected.", "154 In the light of all of the foregoing, the whole of the second plea and also the second part of the third plea, put forward by the Government of Gibraltar, must be rejected.", "B – The United Kingdom’s third plea and the first part of the Government of Gibraltar’s third plea, alleging breach of the rights of the defence", "155 The United Kingdom and the Government of Gibraltar, the former in its third plea, and the latter in the first part of its third plea, raised before the General Court against the contested decision, claim a breach of their rights of defence.", "1.", "Arguments of the parties", "156 The Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom claim that the Commission infringed their rights of defence in that it raised for the first time in the contested decision the issue of material selectivity from the viewpoint of the allegedly favourable treatment of offshore companies, that issue being different in nature from those examined during the preliminary assessment made in the decision to initiate the formal procedure.", "157 In carrying out an investigation of State aid, the Commission must take account of the legitimate expectations which the parties concerned may entertain as a result of what was said in the decision to initiate the formal procedure, meaning that it will not base its final decision on considerations in regard to which, in the light of those indications, the parties concerned would not have considered that they must express a view.", "In that regard, the applicants at first instance refer inter alia to Case T‑6/99 ESF Elbe-Stahlwerke Feralpi v Commission [2001] ECR II‑1523, paragraph 126, and to Case T‑176/01 Ferriere Nord v Commission [2004] ECR II‑3931, paragraph 88.", "158 Neither the question addressed to the United Kingdom in paragraph 60(f) of that decision, concerning companies that make no profit or have no employees, nor the fact that the Kingdom of Spain referred to the offshore sector in its observations lodged following the decision to initiate the formal procedure gave the Government of Gibraltar or the United Kingdom reason to suppose that the Commission would also examine material selectivity from the viewpoint of the treatment of offshore companies.", "159 First, that question was not related to the detailed analysis of the proposed tax reform contained in paragraphs 2 to 59 of the decision to initiate the formal procedure.", "Secondly, the Kingdom of Spain’s observations were of a purely formal nature and the Commission at no time intimated that it regarded that factor as relevant for its investigation.", "160 If the Commission had duly drawn their attention to the aspect of the tax treatment of offshore companies, the outcome of the investigation procedure could have been different.", "161 The Commission, supported by the Kingdom of Spain, considers that the rights of defence of the Government of Gibraltar and of the United Kingdom were not infringed.", "162 Its principal submission is that the question of the selective nature of the taxation of offshore companies was raised both in paragraph 60(f) of the decision to initiate the formal procedure and by the Kingdom of Spain in its observations in connection with the formal investigation procedure, upon which the Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom had the opportunity to express their views.", "163 The Commission’s alternative submission is that the outcome of the procedure would not have been different even if the rights of defence of the Government of Gibraltar and of the United Kingdom had been infringed.", "2.", "Findings of the Court", "164 It is appropriate to consider first of all whether the United Kingdom’s rights of defence were infringed.", "165 According to established case-law, observance of the rights of the defence, during the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC, requires the Member State concerned to be placed in a position in which it may effectively make known its views on the truth and relevance of the facts and circumstances alleged and on the documents obtained by the Commission to support its claim that there has been infringement of European Union law (see, to that effect, Case 40/85 Belgium v Commission [1986] ECR 2321, paragraph 28, and Case 234/84 Belgium v Commission [1986] ECR 2263, paragraph 27), as well as on the observations submitted by interested third parties in accordance with Article 88(2) EC.", "In so far as the Member State has not been afforded the opportunity to comment on those observations, the Commission may not use them in its decision against that State (see Case C‑301/87 France v Commission [1990] ECR I‑307, paragraph 30; Case C‑142/87 Belgium v Commission [1990] ECR I‑959, paragraph 47; and Case C‑288/96 Germany v Commission [2000] ECR I‑8237, paragraph 100).", "166 In that regard, it is common ground in the present case that the United Kingdom did have the opportunity to make known its views on the truth and relevance of the facts and circumstances alleged and on the observations submitted by interested third parties, such as, here, those of the Kingdom of Spain, and so the obligations under the case-law cited in the preceding paragraph were met.", "167 In so far as the United Kingdom contends that it was not able to make known its views effectively since, first, the preliminary assessment included in the decision to initiate the formal procedure did not contain any considerations with regard to offshore companies and, secondly, the Commission did not, in its discussions with the Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom during the formal investigation procedure, state that it considered that offshore companies enjoyed selective advantages, its arguments cannot succeed.", "168 With regard, first, to the fact that the preliminary assessment did not contain any considerations with regard to offshore companies, it should be noted that it is true that the Commission is required to express its doubts clearly as to the compatibility of the aid when it initiates a formal investigation procedure, in order to allow the Member State and other parties concerned to respond as fully as possible (judgment of 8 May 2008 in Case C‑49/05 P Ferriere Nord v Commission, paragraph 92).", "169 However, the mere fact that the preliminary assessment of the proposed tax reform notified did not contain any considerations with regard to offshore companies cannot constitute a factor capable of giving rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of the United Kingdom that the Commission would limit its investigation solely to the aspects considered in those preliminary assessments.", "Similarly, nor does that fact mean that the Commission failed to meet its obligation to express its doubts clearly.", "170 First of all, paragraph 60(f) of the decision to initiate the formal procedure contained questions relating specifically to that sector even though the word ‘offshore’ was not used.", "171 Consequently, the United Kingdom was given sufficient warning, in the actual decision to initiate the procedure, that the detailed investigation during the formal procedure for investigation of the proposed tax reform might also relate to sectors which escape taxation by having no employees and not requiring the occupation of property.", "172 Also, the assessment which is included, in accordance with Article 6(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, in the decision to initiate the formal procedure is, as the wording of that provision makes clear, only a ‘preliminary assessment’, marking the start of the formal investigation procedure and above all affording interested parties the opportunity to put forward their views effectively.", "173 In order, inter alia, to ensure the effectiveness of that opportunity, the Commission cannot be prevented, in its final decision, at the end of the formal investigation procedure, from supplementing its ‘preliminary’ assessment by adopting the point of view expressed by those interested parties.", "174 In those circumstances, the conclusion must be drawn that the mere fact that the preliminary assessment of the proposed tax reform notified did not contain specific considerations concerning offshore companies does not lead to a breach of the United Kingdom’s rights of defence.", "175 Secondly, contrary to the United Kingdom’s contention, the Kingdom of Spain’s observations during the formal investigation procedure do not only contain purely factual arguments, but seek specifically to demonstrate that the proposed tax reform notified is also selective because it favours offshore companies enjoying total tax exemption.", "176 The Commission submitted those observations to the United Kingdom, which set out its comments in its letter of 13 February 2003 but did not adopt a position with regard to offshore companies.", "177 The United Kingdom, in contending that it was not able to put forward its views effectively because the Commission had not intimated that it attached importance to the Kingdom of Spain’s observations, adopts a line of argument which amounts to obliging the Commission to adopt a position, during the formal investigation procedure, on the comments received by the interested parties.", "178 The existence of such an obligation is not apparent from Regulation No 659/1999.", "Article 6(2) of that regulation only requires the Commission to submit to the Member State concerned the comments received during the formal procedure, a requirement which the Commission fully complied with in the present case.", "179 In the light of the above, the United Kingdom’s third plea, alleging infringement of its rights of defence, must be rejected, and there is no need to consider whether, had it not been for the irregularity alleged, the outcome of the procedure might have been different, which is a condition to be met in order for an infringement of the rights of the defence to result in annulment of the contested decision (see France v Commission, paragraph 31; Case C-142/87 Belgium v Commission, paragraph 48; and Case C-288/96 Germany v Commission, paragraph 101).", "180 With regard to the rights of defence of the Government of Gibraltar, it should be noted first of all that the latter had the opportunity to submit comments to the Commission, and that it took that opportunity.", "Since the Government of Gibraltar puts forward in essence the same arguments as the United Kingdom, it is sufficient to note that the latter’s rights of defence have not been infringed and so the same applies with regard to those of the Government of Gibraltar.", "The procedural rights of the Government of Gibraltar are, in any event, less extensive than those of the United Kingdom as the Member State concerned in the formal investigation procedure, in accordance with Article 88(2) EC.", "181 In that regard, it is clear from the case-law of the Court that interested parties other than the Member State concerned, such as in the present case the Government of Gibraltar, have, in the procedure for reviewing State aid, only the opportunity to send to the Commission all information intended for the guidance of the latter with regard to its future action and they cannot themselves seek to engage in an adversarial debate with the Commission in the same way as is offered to that Member State (see Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France, paragraph 59, and Joined Cases C‑74/00 P and C‑75/00 P Falck and Acciaierie di Bolzano v Commission [2002] ECR I‑7869, paragraphs 80 and 82).", "182 In the light of all of the foregoing, the United Kingdom’s third plea and the first part of the Government of Gibraltar’s third plea must be rejected as unfounded.", "C – The first plea, relating to regional selectivity", "183 The applicants at first instance claim, in their first plea, that the contested decision infringed Article 87(1) EC in that it concluded that the proposed tax reform was regionally selective.", "184 In that regard, it is clear from paragraphs 86 to 108 above that the proposed tax reform is materially selective in that it confers selective advantages on offshore companies.", "185 That finding is sufficient in itself to substantiate the operative part of the contested decision, which states that the proposed tax reform constitutes a scheme of State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC which the United Kingdom is not authorised to implement.", "186 In those circumstances, as the applicants’ first plea, relating to regional selectivity, does not call into question the existence of material selective advantages, it cannot form grounds for even partial annulment of the contested decision (see, by analogy, the order of the President of the Court in Case C‑159/98 P(R) Netherlands Antilles v Council [1998] ECR I‑4147, paragraph 111).", "187 Thus, the conclusion must be drawn that the first plea, even supposing it were founded, cannot result in annulment of the contested decision and is therefore ineffective.", "188 In the light of all the foregoing, the actions brought by the Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom must be dismissed in their entirety.", "VIII – Costs", "189 Under the first paragraph of Article 122 of the Rules of Procedure, where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court shall make a decision as to costs.", "Article 69 of the Rules of Procedure, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 118 thereof, provides in paragraph 2 that the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "The first subparagraph of Article 69(4) provides that the Member States which intervene in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.", "190 Since the appeals of the Commission and of the Kingdom of Spain have been upheld and the actions of the Government of Gibraltar and of the United Kingdom against the contested decision have been dismissed, the Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom must be ordered, in accordance with the forms of order sought by the Commission and the Kingdom of Spain, to bear, in addition to their own costs, the costs incurred by the Commission and the Kingdom of Spain on appeal and by the Commission at first instance.", "191 The Kingdom of Spain and Ireland as interveners before the General Court and the Court of Justice, respectively, must each bear their own costs.", "On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby:", "1.", "Sets aside the judgment of the Court of First Instance of

Republic to pay the costs.", "The appeal", "First ground of appeal, relating to the concept of State aid, the obligation to state reasons and distortion of evidence", "Arguments of the parties", "22", "By the first part of the first ground of appeal, the Hellenic Republic complains that the General Court infringed Article 107(1) TFEU by distorting the facts and describing them incorrectly, when it held that the compulsory insurance contributions paid in 2008 and 2009 by farmers who received compensation aid paid by ELGA in those years constituted State resources.", "23", "First, the Hellenic Republic submits that the General Court relied on the judgment in Freskot (C‑355/00, EU:C:2003:298) in concluding that that aid constituted State aid; yet, in paragraph 87 of that judgment, the Court held, on the contrary, that it was not — in the case that gave rise to that judgment — sufficiently apprised of the relevant points of fact and law needed in order to rule on the classification of the benefits granted by ELGA as State aid.", "24", "Secondly, the General Court was wrong in finding that the contributions paid by farmers were not ‘private resources’ because they were accounted for as State revenue under Article 5a of Law 1790/1988.", "The Hellenic Republic observes that it is clear from that provision that the special insurance contribution for ELGA was collected by the State or by banks before being paid to ELGA.", "25", "The fact that the legislature lays down detailed rules under which the special insurance contribution collected by the State is to be paid to ELGA does not make that contribution a State resource.", "If such an interpretation were accepted, the classification of that contribution as a private resource or a public resource would turn on its method of collection, and it would therefore be necessary to distinguish the contributions collected by the State from those collected through banks and paid to ELGA.", "Moreover, if the State collected the funds in question without being required to pay them out in full, it would not have provided, in Article 5a(16) of Law 1790/1988, for the levying of a commission.", "26", "Consequently, the State or the banks are merely intermediaries with regard to, or remunerated collectors of, the special insurance contribution.", "It constitutes ELGA revenue exclusively and is not subject to public control, but is merely collected by banking institutions and by the State in order to be paid to ELGA without ever having been available to the competent authority.", "27", "By the second part of the first ground of appeal, the Hellenic Republic complains that the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by not responding to the argument that the special insurance contributions ought to have been deducted from the amount of State aid to be recovered because, in the light of the fact that they were paid in 2008 and 2009 by farmers who were beneficiaries of the alleged aid, they did not satisfy the condition relating to the existence of an economic advantage.", "28", "In the alternative, the Hellenic Republic submits that the General Court applied that condition incorrectly to the facts of the present case, since, because of the existence of those contributions, the payment of compensation aid had only a limited effect on competition, if indeed any impact at all.", "In its assessment, the General Court even upheld an interpretation of the decision at issue that is contrary to the principle prohibiting reformatio in peius.", "29", "The Commission disputes the admissibility of the argument alleging distortion of the facts as well as the merits of both parts of the present ground of appeal.", "Findings of the Court", "30", "With regard to the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be recalled, in the first place, as regards the argument that the General Court distorted the facts, that it follows from the second subparagraph of Article 256(1) TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union that the General Court has exclusive jurisdiction, first, to find the facts, except where the substantive inaccuracy of its findings is apparent from the documents in the file submitted to it, and, second, to assess those facts (judgments in General Motors v Commission, C‑551/03 P, EU:C:2006:229, paragraph 51, and ThyssenKrupp Nirosta v Commission, C‑352/09 P, EU:C:2011:191, paragraph 179).", "31", "Therefore, the appraisal of the facts by the General Court does not constitute, save where the clear sense of the evidence produced before it is distorted, a question of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice (judgments in Archer Daniels Midland and Archer Daniels Midland Ingredients v Commission, C‑397/03 P, EU:C:2006:328, paragraph 85, and ThyssenKrupp Nirosta v Commission, C‑352/09 P, EU:C:2011:191, paragraph 180).", "32", "Where an appellant alleges distortion of the evidence by the General Court, he must, under Article 256 TFEU, the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 168(1)(d) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, indicate precisely the evidence alleged to have been distorted by the General Court and show the errors of appraisal which, in his view, led to such distortion.", "In addition, it is settled case-law of the Court that distortion must be obvious from the documents in the Court’s file, without there being any need to carry out a new assessment of the facts and the evidence (judgments in Lafarge v Commission, C‑413/08 P, EU:C:2010:346, paragraph 16 and the case-law cited, and Austria v Scheucher-Fleisch and Others, C‑47/10 P, EU:C:2011:698, paragraph 59 and the case-law cited).", "33", "In the present case, the General Court found as follows in paragraphs 122 to 128 and 130 to 132 of the judgment under appeal:", "‘122", "The Commission recalled in the contested decision, that the Court had already held in the judgment in Freskot [(C‑355/00, EU:C:2003:298)] that “the national legislation at issue clearly establishe[d] that the benefits provided by ELGA [were] granted through State resources and [were] imputable to the State within the meaning of the Court’s case-law (see, in particular, France v Commission, [C‑482/99, EU:C:2002:294], paragraph 24)” (recital 58).", "123", "The Commission found that:", "“... under Article 5(a) of Law … 1790/1988 ... and other provisions of Greek legislation in force, ELGA’s income from the special contribution was collected by the tax authorities, entered in the State budget as State revenue and paid to ELGA from the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture (now the Ministry of Rural Development and Food).", "Consequently, the fact that the contributions in question are entered into the accounts as State revenue is sufficient to consider that the payments made by ELGA were financed by State resources” (recital 58).", "124", "Those findings, which are not disputed by the Hellenic Republic, suffice to conclude that the compensation payments that correspond to the contributions by farmers are State resources and are imputable to the State.", "125", "Therefore, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claims, the part of the payments corresponding to the contributions by farmers may not be regarded as being private funds.", "Accordingly, the fact that a part of the payments made in 2008 was financed by contributions by farmers does not preclude these being State aid financed by resources imputable to the State.", "126", "Moreover, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claims, the classification as State aid does not apply to the contributions paid by farmers but to the payments made in 2008.", "In that regard, it must be recalled that it has been held in the context of the first and second pleas in law that neither the compensatory nature of the measures, nor the fact that they are justified by a social objective, precludes the payments made by ELGA being classified as an advantage.", "127", "Furthermore, the Hellenic Republic concedes that the contributions paid by farmers are not proportionate to risk and that it is possible that certain farmers pay a contribution without receiving compensation payments from ELGA.", "The payments made in 2008 were therefore independent of the contributions paid by the farmers and constituted an advantage that the beneficiary undertaking could not have obtained under normal market conditions.", "128", "It follows from the foregoing that the Commission was fully entitled to find that the payments made by ELGA in 2008 were advantages financed by State resources, even if they were financed in part by contributions by farmers.", "The Hellenic Republic has not shown that the Commission erred in classifying those payments as State aid.", "...", "130", "The contested decision states that the compensation payments made by ELGA in 2009, of EUR 415019452 in total, were made on the basis of the Inter-ministerial decree.", "The Inter-ministerial decree provided for compensation of EUR 425 million, on an exceptional basis, for damage in 2008 and stated that, for the purpose of paying that compensation, ELGA would take out a loan, guaranteed by the State, with a bank, for the total amount ...", "131", "It follows that the Commission was correct in finding that the compensation payments made in 2009 were not financed by the contributions paid under the ELGA compulsory insurance scheme ... .", "132", "Therefore, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claims, the contributions paid by farmers in 2009 under the compulsory insurance scheme may not be regarded as financing part of the aid paid in 2009.’", "34", "In the light of the General Court’s findings set out above, the argument alleging distortion of the facts must be rejected at the outset, since, by its line of argument, the Hellenic Republic has not shown that the General Court distorted the facts in a manner obvious from the documents in the file.", "35", "In the second place, with regard to the argument that the General Court described the facts incorrectly, it should be stated that, having first of all pointed out, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, that the classification as State aid did not apply to the special insurance contribution paid by farmers but to the payment of compensation aid by ELGA;  having then found, in paragraph 127 of that judgment, that the payments made in 2008 were independent of those contributions;  and, lastly, having pointed out, in paragraphs 130 to 132 of that judgment, that the payments made in 2009 were financed not by the contributions but by means of a loan, guaranteed by the State, taken out to that end with a bank,  the General Court was entitled to conclude, without erring in law, that those payments were advantages financed by State resources.", "36", "Nor did the General Court err in law, in the third place, in relying, in paragraph 122 of the judgment under appeal, on paragraph 81 of the judgment in Freskot (C‑355/00, EU:C:2003:298), since the Court held in that paragraph, with regard to a previous version of Article 5a of Law 1790/1988 but a version in essence identical to that applicable to the present dispute, that that legislation ‘clearly establishe[d] that the benefits provided by ELGA [were] granted through State resources and [were] imputable to the State within the meaning of the Court’s case-law’.", "37", "Moreover, it should be pointed out that the Hellenic Republic does not dispute that the contributions to the special insurance contribution, in so far as they were collected by the tax authorities, were included in the State budget.", "38", "As regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, it must be recalled that, according to the settled case-law of the Court, the duty incumbent upon the General Court under Article 36 and the first paragraph of Article 53 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union to state reasons for its judgments does not require the General Court to provide an account that follows exhaustively and one by one all the arguments articulated by the parties to the case.", "The reasoning may therefore be implicit, on condition that it enables the persons concerned to understand the grounds of the General Court’s judgment and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient information to exercise its powers of review on appeal (see, inter alia, judgment in A2A v Commission, C‑320/09 P, EU:C:2011:858, paragraph 97).", "39", "In the present case, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court pointed out that, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claimed, the classification as State aid did not apply to the contributions paid by farmers but to the payments made in 2008 by ELGA.", "40", "Furthermore, in that same paragraph, the General Court referred to its findings made in the context of the examination of the first and second pleas in law in the action for annulment.", "In the context of that examination, the General Court stated, in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal, ‘that the fact that the payments made by ELGA in 2009 were intended to compensate for damage caused to agricultural production because of adverse weather conditions d[id] not preclude the existence of an advantage and the classification as State aid’ and, in paragraph 102 of that judgment, ‘that, according to settled case-law, competition is distorted where a measure mitigates the burden imposed on a beneficiary undertaking and thereby strengthens its position as regards competing undertakings’.", "41", "In those circumstances, it must be held that the statement of reasons in the judgment under appeal meets the requirements referred to in paragraph 38 of this judgment.", "42", "Moreover, having found that the payments of compensation aid made in 2008 and 2009 were independent of the contributions paid by the farmers, the General Court was entitled to conclude, without erring in law, that those payments constituted an advantage that the beneficiary undertaking could not have obtained under normal market conditions, and therefore affected competition.", "43", "In view of the independence of the contributions paid by the farmers in relation to the compensation aid received by them, those contributions cannot be regarded as specific charges imposed on the advantage consisting, in the present case, of the payment of that aid; nor can those contributions be regarded as connected with the introduction of that advantage.", "Accordingly, the General Court was fully entitled to conclude that, in the present case, the Commission was justified, under Article 107(1) TFEU, in refusing to offset the advantage and those same contributions (see, to that effect, judgment in France Télécom v Commission, C‑81/10 P, EU:C:2011:811, paragraphs 43 and 48).", "44", "It follows that the first ground of appeal must be rejected as, in part, inadmissible and, in part, unfounded.", "Second ground of appeal, relating to the concept of State aid and the obligation to state reasons", "Arguments of the parties", "45", "The Hellenic Republic complains that the General Court rejected its first and second pleas in law in the action by relying on the settled case-law of the Court that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or which are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are to be regarded as State aid (judgment in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 84 and the case-law cited).", "In so doing, the General Court failed to have regard to the fact that those principles are valid only under normal market and economic conditions and not under the exceptional conditions experienced by the Greek economy in 2009.", "46", "The Hellenic Republic submits that, against that exceptional background, the General Court ought to have interpreted and applied Article 107 TFEU differently and, in particular, ought to have assessed whether the compensation aid paid to Greek farmers in 2009 had in fact conferred an advantage on them and placed them in a more advantageous position as regards their commercial transactions within the European Union.", "47", "In view of the fact that, during that period, the Greek economy had to face a series of budgetary measures aimed at stabilising the economy, such as the over-taxation of farmers, the introduction of exceptional and solidarity contributions, the dismantling of the welfare state, increased value added tax, higher heating oil prices, and cuts in wages and pensions, any ‘economic advantage’ that the farmers might have received from ELGA would automatically have been wiped out.", "48", "The General Court failed to examine whether, in such exceptional circumstances, the financial impact of the measures adopted by the Inter-ministerial decree could in fact affect trade between Member States and threaten to distort competition.", "In particular, it ought to have determined whether those exceptional circumstances were such as to alter the conditions for the application of the de minimis scheme relating to aid which does not have a significant impact on trade and competition between the Member States.", "49", "Lastly, the Hellenic Republic submits, in the alternative, that the General Court failed to examine its arguments fully.", "50", "The Commission disputes the admissibility as well as the merits of the present ground of appeal.", "Findings of the Court", "51", "The documents of the proceedings at first instance show that the argument put forward by the Hellenic Republic before the Court to the effect that the settled case-law of the Court relating to the concept of State aid, referred to in paragraph 45 of this judgment, is inapplicable to the present case because of the exceptional economic conditions experienced by the Hellenic Republic in 2009, was not put forward before the General Court.", "52", "At first instance, the Hellenic Republic complained that the Commission did not adequately explain, in the decision at issue, in what respect the compensation payments had conferred on the farmers concerned a competitive advantage affecting trade between Member States, and could, therefore, be classified as State aid, notwithstanding the serious crisis affecting the Greek economy at that time.", "53", "However, in raising such an argument, the Hellenic Republic cannot be regarded as having set out a complaint other than one alleging that the decision at issue failed to state reasons.", "54", "Therefore, the argument that the General Court infringed Article 107(1) TFEU by failing to find — in the context of the serious crisis affecting the Greek economy in 2009 — that the payment of compensation aid neither conferred any competitive advantage on the farmers concerned nor affected trade between Member States, is new in character.", "55", "Consequently, that argument must be rejected as inadmissible.", "According to the settled case-law of the Court of Justice, to allow a party to put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it has not raised before the General Court, would in effect allow that party to bring before the Court of Justice a wider case than that heard by the General Court (see, to that effect, judgments in Alliance One International and Standard Commercial Tobacco v Commission and Commission v Alliance One International and Others, C‑628/10 P and C‑14/11 P, EU:C:2012:479, paragraph 111, and Groupe Gascogne v Commission, C‑58/12 P, EU:C:2013:770, paragraph 35).", "56", "It follows that the second ground of appeal is admissible only in so far as, by that ground, the Hellenic Republic in essence complains that the General Court did not respond to the complaint that the decision at issue was inadequately reasoned.", "57", "As stated in paragraph 38 of this judgment, the duty incumbent upon the General Court to state reasons for its judgments does not require the General Court to provide an account that follows exhaustively and one by one all the arguments articulated by the parties to the case.", "The reasoning may therefore be implicit, on condition that it enables the persons concerned to understand the grounds of the General Court’s judgment and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient information to exercise its powers of review on appeal (judgment in Isdin v Bial-Portela, C‑597/12 P, EU:C:2013:672, paragraph 21).", "58", "It has already been held in paragraph 41 of this judgment that the statement of reasons in the judgment under appeal enabled the parties, and the Hellenic Republic in particular, to understand the grounds on which the General Court found that there was an economic advantage liable to distort competition.", "59", "It should be added that, in its response to the complaint that the statement of reasons concerning the condition as to there being an adverse effect on competition and an effect on trade was inadequate, the General Court stated, in paragraph 108 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘the economic crisis in the European Union from 2008 does not constitute a circumstance that is capable of calling in question the fact that the agricultural sector is exposed to strong competition within the European Union’ and that ‘the Commission has moreover adopted specific rules aimed at authorising certain State aid during the economic crisis, in particular, the [TCF], which precluded aid granted in the primary agricultural sector being declared compatible with the internal market’.", "60", "It follows that the second ground of appeal must be rejected as, in part, inadmissible and, in part, unfounded.", "Third ground of appeal, relating to misinterpretation and misapplication of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and the obligation to state reasons", "First part of the third ground of appeal, relating to misinterpretation and misapplication of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU", "– Arguments of the parties", "61", "The Hellenic Republic complains that the General Court infringed Article 107(3)(b) TFEU by failing to examine whether the Commission had made a manifest error of assessment, at the very least, on account of its refusal to apply that provision notwithstanding the serious disturbances in the Greek economy.", "62", "Furthermore, the General Court did not examine its arguments relating to the Commission’s incorrect restriction of the scope of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU, in view of the exceptional conditions in the Greek economy in 2009, which were different from those contemplated in the TCF.", "By relying on the amended TCF, the General Court refused to apply that provision directly, even though it had pointed out that the validity of communications issued by the Commission is conditional on their being consistent with the provisions of the TFEU.", "63", "The Commission contends that the Hellenic Republic has put forward out of time the exceptional circumstances of the economic crisis in Greece at the material time, which circumstances were not established before the General Court.", "Consequently, the Hellenic Republic may not legitimately claim before the Court that those unproven circumstances ought to have led the General Court to reach a different conclusion as regards the application of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU.", "The Commission also disputes the merits of that line of argument.", "– Findings of the Court", "64", "As regards the admissibility of the first part of the third ground of appeal, the documents of the proceedings at first instance show that, in support of the fourth plea in law in the action for annulment, by which the Hellenic Republic complained that the Commission misused its discretion and misinterpreted and misapplied Article 107(3)(b) TFEU, the Hellenic Republic put forward evidence, which — in its view — was such as to establish, inter alia, the existence of a very serious disturbance in the Greek economy as a whole in 2009.", "65", "Consequently, as the Advocate General observed in points 32 and 34 of her Opinion, even if it is apparent from paragraphs 185 to 188 of the judgment under appeal that, in its response to the fourth plea in law in the action for annulment, the General Court did not rule on the existence in 2009 of a very serious disturbance in the Greek economy, the Hellenic Republic is entitled to claim before the Court that the General Court erred in law in rejecting its argument that such a disturbance justified the application of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU to the facts of the present case.", "66", "As regards the substance, the General Court held as follows in paragraphs 185 to 188 of the judgment under appeal:", "‘185", "With regard to the arguments raised in the fourth plea, it is clear that, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claims, the Commission had to base its decision on the [TCF] and not directly apply Article 107(3)(b) TFEU in order to assess the compatibility of the payments made by ELGA in 2009 on account of the economic crisis experienced in Greece.", "186", "It is clear from the case-law that, in adopting rules of conduct and announcing by publishing them that they will henceforth apply to the cases to which they relate, the Commission imposes a limit on the exercise of its aforementioned discretion and cannot depart from those rules without being found, where appropriate, to be in breach of general principles of law, such as equal treatment or the protection of legitimate expectations (see judgment[s] in Germany and Others v Kronofrance, [C‑75/05 P and C‑80/05 P, EU:C:2008:482], paragraph 60 and the case-law cited, and … Holland Malt v Commission, C‑464/09 P, [EU:C:2010:733], paragraph 46).", "187", "Accordingly, in the specific area of State aid, the Commission is bound by the guidelines and notices that it issues, to the extent that they do not depart from the rules in the Treaty (see judgment in Holland Malt v Commission, [C‑464/09 P, EU:C:2010:733], paragraph 47 and the case-law cited).", "188", "Therefore, it is necessary to reject the arguments of the Hellenic Republic to the effect that, on account of the serious disturbance in the Greek economy due to the economic crisis experienced in Greece since the end of 2008 and in 2009, the Commission should have declared the payments made by ELGA in 2009 compatible directly on the basis of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU.’", "67", "Under Article 107(3)(b) TFEU, ‘the following may be considered to be compatible with the internal market: … aid … to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State’.", "68", "As the General Court stated in paragraphs 159 to 161 of the judgment under appeal, it is settled case-law of the Court that, in the application of Article 107(3) TFEU, the Commission enjoys wide discretion, the exercise of which involves complex economic and social assessments (judgments in Germany and Others v Kronofrance, C‑75/05 P and C‑80/05 P, EU:C:2008:482, paragraph 59, and Banco Privado Português and Massa Insolvente do Banco Privado Português, C‑667/13, EU:C:2015:151, paragraph 67).", "69", "Furthermore, as the General Court stated in paragraphs 186 and 187 of the judgment under appeal, the Court has also consistently held that, in adopting rules of conduct and announcing by publishing them that they will henceforth apply to the cases to which they relate, the Commission imposes a limit on the exercise of its aforementioned discretion and, in principle, cannot depart from those rules without being found, where appropriate, to be in breach of general principles of law, such as equal treatment or the protection of legitimate expectations (judgments in Holland Malt v Commission, C‑464/09 P, EU:C:2010:733, paragraph 46, and Banco Privado Português and Massa Insolvente do Banco Privado Português, C‑667/13, EU:C:2015:151, paragraph 69).", "70", "However, in the specific area of State aid, the Commission is bound by the guidelines that it issues, to the extent that they do not depart from the rules in the TFEU, including, in particular, Article 107(3)(b) TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment in Holland Malt v Commission, C‑464/09 P, EU:C:2010:733, paragraph 47), and to the extent that their application is not in breach of general principles of law, such as equal treatment, in particular where exceptional circumstances, different from those envisaged in those guidelines, distinguish a given sector of the economy of a Member State.", "71", "Consequently, first, the Commission may not fail to have regard to Article 107(3) TFEU by adopting guidelines vitiated by an error of law or a manifest error of assessment, nor may it waive, by the adoption of guidelines, the exercise of the discretion that that provision confers on it.", "Further, when, in the exercise of that discretion, it adopts guidelines of that nature, these must be kept under continuous review for the purposes of anticipating any major developments not covered by those measures.", "72", "Secondly, the adoption of such guidelines does not relieve the Commission of its obligation to examine the specific exceptional circumstances relied on by a Member State, in a particular case, for the purpose of requesting the direct application of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU, and to provide reasons for its refusal to grant such a request, should the case arise.", "73", "In the present case, it is not in dispute that, precisely because of the effect of the economic crisis experienced by the Member States, and in particular, the Hellenic Republic, on the primary agricultural sector of the European Union, the Commission exercised the discretion conferred on it by Article 107(3)(b) TFEU by adopting the TCF and then the amended TCF, since both the former and the latter expressly mention that sector.", "74", "However, the fact remains that although the Hellenic Republic claimed before the General Court that Article 107(3)(b) TFEU ought to be applied directly to the facts of the case, notwithstanding the existence of the rules of conduct set out in the TCF and the amended TCF, it did not argue, in support of that claim, that there were, in the present case, specific exceptional circumstances in the primary agricultural sector concerned, such as those referred to in paragraphs 70 and 72 of this judgment.", "75", "Indeed, it is apparent from the documents in the file that the material that the Hellenic Republic put before the General Court was intended to establish the existence of a very serious disturbance affecting the Greek economy from the end of 2008 and in 2009, but it was not such as to prove to the requisite legal standard that that economy was faced with specific exceptional circumstances that ought, in this case, to have led the Commission to assess the aid at issue directly in the light of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU.", "76", "Consequently, the first part of the third ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "The second part of the third ground of appeal, relating to the obligation to state reasons", "– Arguments of the parties", "77", "The Hellenic Republic complains that the General Court failed to respond to its argument that the decision at issue was excessive in that it also required the recovery of the compensation aid that constituted compensation for actual damage.", "Furthermore, the situation in the Greek agricultural sector, already exceptionally difficult when the compensation aid was paid, was even more precarious at the date the decision at issue was adopted.", "78", "Specifically, the General Court did not examine to what extent the decision at issue, in so far as it ordered the recovery of the contributions paid to farmers, was compatible with the provisions of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and of Article 14(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [108 TFEU] (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1).", "79", "The Commission contends that that line of argument is too vague in that it does not identify precisely the complaint raised at first instance to which — it is claimed — the General Court did not respond, and that it is, in any event, unfounded.", "– Findings of the Court", "80", "First, as the Commission correctly contends, the General Court responded in detail to the complaint relating to an alleged breach of the principle of proportionality, raised in the fifth plea in law in the action for annulment, and to that relating to the calculation of the amount of aid to be

a finding of misuse of power and, second, failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on that point", "Arguments of the parties", "31 Ramondín complains that the Court of First Instance, at paragraphs 82 to 88 of the judgment under appeal, rejected its plea based on misuse of powers on the part of the Commission.", "The Commission used its powers relating to the State aid procedure, an area in which it has exclusive competence and wide powers, in order to implement tax harmonisation.", "Such harmonisation belongs in reality to the procedure provided for in Articles 101 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 96 EC) and 102 of the EC Treaty (now Article 97 EC), which confers competence on the Council of the European Union.", "32 The Commission began with small communities or small Member States, with limited scope for decisions and action.", "It acted in that way because of the difficulties it had encountered in relation to tax harmonisation, since the powerful Member States refused to give up their competences.", "33 In Ramondín’s submission, since the only tangible objective aspect of the instant case was the absence of any complaint from a competitor, it had to be presumed that the aims pursued were other than those stated.", "Therefore, the procedure initiated was flawed ab initio.", "34 The Territorio Histórico de Álava submits that the Court of First Instance ought to have made a finding of misuse of powers.", "It is in doubt as to the reasons which led the Commission to initiate a large number of procedures against the Normas Forales of the Basque Country.", "It also is in doubt as to why a series of fiscal measures were removed from the list drawn up by a group called ‘Primarolo’, responsible within the Council for detecting fiscal measures to be abolished for the purposes of tax harmonisation, only to be subsequently challenged through the State aid procedures.", "35 In its submission, the reluctance of a number of Member States makes any agreement within the Council regarding tax harmonisation impossible.", "That is why the Commission chose the quicker and simpler route of State aid procedures.", "36 The Territorio Histórico de Álava also complains that the Court of First Instance failed to state grounds as regards the plea alleging misuse of powers.", "The Court gave a fairly superficial answer, refraining from discussion of the reasons why the Commission initiated a large number of procedures against the Normas Forales of the Basque Country and failing to establish why the abovementioned series of fiscal measures was removed from the list by the Primarolo group only to be challenged through the State aid procedures.", "37 The Commission, responding to Ramondín’s arguments, contends that the Court of First Instance rightly stated, at paragraphs 82 to 87 of the judgment under appeal, that the conditions laid down by Community case-law for a finding of misuse of powers were not fulfilled.", "In the present case, the allegation that there has been a misuse of powers is based on Ramondín’s subjective assessment of the Commission’s conduct.", "That assessment is not supported by any objective element.", "It is thus founded not on relevant evidence, as is required by case-law, but on purely subjective assertions concerning the Commission’s supposed intentions.", "38 In reality, in relation to its plea, Ramondín merely reiterates its extremely narrow interpretation of what constitutes aid and of the criterion of selectivity.", "The alleged misuse of powers consists only in an interpretation of ‘aid’ which differs from that advocated by Ramondín.", "39 In reply to the arguments of the Territorio Histórico de Álava, the Commission submits that the plea alleging misuse of powers was not invoked by the appellant before the Court of First Instance.", "This ground of appeal is thus manifestly inadmissible.", "In any event, it is unfounded, for the same reasons as those invoked vis-à-vis Ramondín.", "Finally, the Court of First Instance adequately stated the grounds of the judgment under appeal for the purpose of rejecting the plea.", "40 The Comunidad Autónoma de La Rioja contends that the Territorio Histórico de Álava’s ground of appeal alleging misuse of powers is inadmissible, since that plea was not raised before the Court of First Instance.", "41 In any event, it contends that Ramondín and the Territorio Histórico de Álava have produced no objective, relevant or consistent evidence from which it may be concluded that the Commission’s objective in adopting the contested decision was tax harmonisation.", "Findings of the Court", "42 Contrary to the assertions of the Commission and the Comunidad Autónoma de La Rioja, the Territorio Histórico de Álava did raise before the Court of First Instance, in the initial application itself, at paragraph 71 et seq., a plea alleging misuse of powers on the part of the Commission.", "43 That plea was examined with regard to Ramondín and the Territorio Histórico de Álava at paragraphs 82 to 88 of the judgment under appeal.", "44 The Court of First Instance rightly observed that a measure is only vitiated by misuse of powers if it appears, on the basis of objective, relevant and consistent evidence, to have been taken with the exclusive or main purpose of achieving an end other than that stated (see, inter alia, Case C‑110/97 Netherlands v Council [2001] ECR I‑8763, paragraph 137 and the cases cited).", "45 At paragraphs 85 to 87, it analysed and assessed the applicants’ allegations and their arguments.", "It found that they had not adduced any objective evidence from which it could be concluded that the Commission’s real purpose in adopting the contested decision was to achieve tax harmonisation.", "46 In doing that, the Court of First Instance undertook an assessment of the facts which does not, unless the clear sense of the evidence produced to it was distorted, constitute a question of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice (see inter alia Joined Cases C‑280/99 P to C‑282/99 P Moccia Irme and Others v Commission [2001] ECR I‑4717, paragraph 78, and Joined Cases C‑238/99 P, C‑244/99 P, C‑245/99 P, C‑247/99 P, C‑250/99 P to C‑252/99 P and C‑254/99 P Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij and Others v Commission [2002] ECR I‑8375, paragraph 285).", "47 The appellants confine themselves, by assertions, to challenging those findings of fact.", "They do not produce any evidence such as to establish that the Court of First Instance distorted the clear sense of the evidence produced to it.", "In any event it cannot be maintained that the Court of First Instance should have concluded from the absence of any complaint from a competitor that the Commission’s objectives were other than those stated.", "The mere fact that there was no complaint does not admit of such a hypothesis.", "48 It follows that the ground of appeal alleging misuse of powers must be rejected.", "As regards the ground of appeal based on a failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on this point, it must be held that Ramondín did not raise that plea in its appeal.", "50 In stating, in its pleading lodged on 18 February 2004, that it was maintaining its ground of appeal concerning the failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal in relation to the plea alleging misuse of powers, Ramondín is thus, in reality, introducing a new plea in law.", "That plea is inadmissible under Articles 42(2) and 118 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice.", "51", "As regards the Territorio Histórico de Álava, which put forward a ground of appeal concerning failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal and maintained it in its pleading lodged on 20 February 2004, it is to be noted that that judgment states:", "– at paragraph 85, that all the applicants’ arguments were based on speculation regarding possible underlying reasons for the contested decision and that they had not even shown that any harmonisation had in fact been achieved at Community level by the contested decision;", "– at paragraph 86, that the Territorio Histórico de Álava referred to the cases which gave rise to the order of the President of the Court of Justice of 16 February 2000 in Joined Cases C-400/97 to C‑402/97 Juntas Generales de Guipúzcoa and Others [2000] ECR I-1073, cases in which the Commission, in the applicant’s submission, undermined the legislative capacity of the Basque authorities in the field of taxation in finding that the Normas Forales constituted State aid since they were applicable exclusively to a particular area of a Member State;", "– at paragraph 87, that the last-mentioned argument had to be rejected, since in the contested decision the Commission had not taken the criterion of regional selectivity as a basis for establishing that the tax advantages from which Ramondín benefited constituted State aid falling within the scope of Article 92 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 87 EC).", "52 That statement of the grounds appears adequate in the light of the arguments presented before the Court of First Instance in the application and the reply.", "Those arguments did not include any reference to withdrawal of a series of tax measures from a list drawn up by a group set up within the Council.", "53 It follows that the Territorio Histórico de Álava’s ground of appeal concerning a failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal so far as concerns the alleged misuse of powers on the part of the Commission must be rejected.", "The grounds of appeal whereby the Territorio Histórico de Álava alleges, first, incorrect categorisation of the impugned tax measures as State aid incompatible with the common market and, second, failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on that point", "Arguments of the parties", "54 Before the Court of First Instance, the Territorio Histórico de Álava maintained that the Commission had infringed Article 92 of the Treaty by considering the tax credit of 45% and the reduction in the basis of assessment to corporation tax to be State aid incompatible with the common market on the ground that Normas Forales 22/1994 and 24/1996 constituted specific measures favouring ‘certain undertakings’.", "It claimed that, in any event, any selective nature which those measures might have was justified by the nature and scheme of the tax system.", "55 The Territorio Histórico de Álava complains that the Court of First Instance, at paragraphs 23 to 65 of the judgment under appeal, rejected that argument and thus erred in law in applying Article 92 of the Treaty.", "56 In the pleading which it lodged on 20 February 2004, it states that it maintains its ground of annulment, but at an earlier stage than that of the categorisation of the impugned tax measures as State aid.", "It claims that during the proceedings at first instance it maintained that those measures were outside the scope of Article 92 of the Treaty, in so far as, as tax measures, they were justified for the purpose of attaining an economic-policy objective.", "The Court of First Instance took the view that that did not preclude its categorisation as State aid incompatible with the Treaty.", "That conclusion is incorrect because it was formulated at an inappropriate point in the interpretation process.", "In reality, the Court of First Instance should, before addressing any question of categorisation as State aid, have considered that tax measures adopted before the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning taxation policy (OJ 1998 C 2, p. 1) and the Commission notice of 10 December 1998 on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation (OJ 1998 C 384, p. 3) were excluded from the review of State aid.", "Where such measures formed part of the industrial policy implemented by the Member State concerned, they should have been excluded from the outset from the scope of Article 92 of the Treaty.", "57 In the same pleading, the Territorio Histórico de Álava further states that it also maintains its ground of appeal alleging failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal as regards the point of law raised.", "58", "The Commission contends that, in its present form, the ground of appeal alleging incorrect categorisation of the impugned tax measures as State aid incompatible with the common market, notwithstanding the amended form in which it is presented, still requires an examination by the Court of the question of the nature as aid of those measures.", "The analysis carried out pursuant to Article 92 of the Treaty contains no stage preceding that of the discussion of whether the measure in question must be categorised as State aid; the fiscal nature of a measure is of no relevance to the determination of whether or not it constitutes aid.", "Nor could the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning taxation policy and the code of conduct annexed thereto alter the allocation of powers established in the Treaty.", "In those circumstances, by disputing the competence of the Commission, the Territorio Histórico de Álava is persisting in challenging the categorisation as State aid of the impugned tax measures.", "59 The Comunidad Autónoma de La Rioja submits that the Territorio Histórico de Álava is in actual fact maintaining that the impugned fiscal measures do not constitute State aid, although it is now putting forward new arguments in support of its proposition.", "The Court should thus not exclude an examination and categorisation of those measures in the light of Article 92 of the Treaty.", "Findings of the Court", "60 It must be borne in mind that to allow a party to put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it has not raised before the Court of First Instance would be to allow it to bring before the Court, whose jurisdiction in appeals is limited, a case of wider ambit than that which came before the Court of First Instance.", "In an appeal the Court’s jurisdiction is confined to review of the findings of law on the pleas argued before the Court of First Instance (see, in particular, Case C-136/92 P Commission v Brazzelli Lualdi and Others [1994] ECR I-1981, paragraph 59, Case C‑7/95 P John Deere v Commission [1998] ECR I‑3111, paragraph 62, and Case C‑217/01 P Hendrickx v Cedefop [2003] ECR I‑3701, paragraph 37).", "61", "In the present case, the Territorio Histórico de Álava did not contend at first instance that:", "– the impugned tax measures are precluded as such from the scope of the law on State aid;", "– Article 92 of the Treaty has applied to the provisions of tax law only since the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning tax policy and the Commission notice of 10 December 1998 on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation.", "62 In reality, it referred to the economic-policy objectives of the measure reducing the basis of assessment in the course of argument concerning the selectivity of that measure, that is to say, at the stage of the argument concerning the categorisation of the measures as State aid incompatible with the common market for the purposes of Article 92 of the Treaty.", "63 The Court of First Instance examined the corresponding arguments at paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal.", "64 The argument submitted to the Court in the present appeal, namely that, in substance, the tax measure at issue was excluded at the outset, at a stage preceding the legal reasoning, from the scope of Article 92 of the Treaty and, subsequently, from actual review by the Commission, therefore constitutes a plea raised for the first time in the appeal.", "65 This new plea must be declared inadmissible, as must the ground of appeal alleging failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on the point of law raised, since the latter cannot be dissociated from the former.", "66 It follows from all of the foregoing that the appeals must be dismissed.", "Costs", "67 Under the first paragraph of Article 122 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs.", "68 Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, applicable to the appeal procedure by virtue of Article 118, the

Principal Administrator,", "having regard to the written procedure and further to the hearing on 4 February 2013,", "after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 21 March 2013,", "gives the following", "Judgment", "1", "By its appeal, Telefónica SA (‘Telefónica’) asks the Court to set aside the order of the General Court of the European Union of 21 March 2012 in Case T-228/10 Telefónica v Commission (‘the order under appeal’), by which the General Court dismissed as inadmissible its action for annulment of Article 1(1) of Commission Decision 2011/5/EC of 28 October 2009 on the tax amortisation of financial goodwill for foreign shareholding acquisitions C 45/07 (ex NN 51/07, ex CP 9/07) implemented by Spain (OJ 2011 L 7, p. 48; ‘the contested decision’).", "Background to the dispute", "2", "Article 12(5) of Law 43/1995 of 27 December 1995 on corporation tax (BOE No 310 of 28 December 1995, p. 37072) provided that the acquisition of a shareholding in a company not established in Spain could, under certain conditions, result in financial goodwill that was capable of being amortised for up to 20 years, thereby reducing the acquiring company’s tax burden (‘the scheme at issue’).", "3", "The European Commission took the view that the scheme at issue, which did not apply to the acquisition of shareholdings in companies established in Spain, constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, and it accordingly initiated the formal investigation procedure in accordance with Article 88(2) EC by a decision of 10 October 2007 inviting the Kingdom of Spain and the potential beneficiaries of that scheme to submit their comments.", "4", "On completion of the procedure, the Commission adopted the contested decision.", "5", "Article 1(1) of the contested decision states that the scheme at issue was put into effect in breach of Article 88(3) EC and declares it incompatible with the common market.", "6", "However, the Commission acknowledged that it had, before the initiation of the formal investigation procedure and as a result of statements of two Commissioners to the European Parliament, provided specific, unconditional and consistent assurances of a nature such that the beneficiaries of the scheme at issue could entertain justified hopes that it was lawful, in the sense that it did not fall within the scope of the State aid rules because it was not selective.", "Accordingly, the Commission concluded that those beneficiaries had a legitimate expectation that no aid would be recovered and it therefore decided that advantages granted by 21 December 2007, the date on which the Commission’s decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union, could be preserved subject to certain conditions.", "7", "That is the reason why Article 1(2) of the contested decision provides that the scheme at issue can continue to apply, on the basis of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations, to shareholdings acquired by that date.", "8", "Under Article 4(1) of the contested decision, the Kingdom of Spain is to recover the incompatible aid referred to in Article 1(1) thereof from the beneficiaries whose rights in foreign companies, acquired in the context of intra-Community acquisitions, do not fulfil the conditions described in Article 1(2).", "9", "Article 5 of the contested decision provides that recovery of the aid in question is to be immediate and effective and that the Kingdom of Spain is to ensure that that decision is implemented within four months of the date of notification thereof.", "10", "Finally, Article 6 of the contested decision provides that the Kingdom of Spain is required to submit certain information to the Commission and to keep it informed of the progress of the national measures taken to implement that decision.", "In particular, under Article 6(1)(a) the Kingdom of Spain is required to submit to the Commission the list of beneficiaries that received aid under the scheme at issue.", "It is undisputed that Telefónica appeared on that list.", "11", "In 2005 and 2006 Telefónica had acquired two shareholdings – in a company established in the Czech Republic and in another company whose seat was in the United Kingdom – with the benefit of the scheme at issue and in both cases those acquisitions took place before the date laid down in Article 1(2) of the contested decision.", "Procedure before the General Court and the order under appeal", "12", "In its action against the contested decision, brought on 21 March 2010, Telefónica claimed that Article 1(1) of the contested decision should be annulled.", "13", "By separate document lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 30 September 2010, the Commission raised an objection of inadmissibility under Article 114(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court.", "It contended that the action was inadmissible on the ground that Telefónica had not shown either that it had a legal interest in bringing proceedings or that it was individually concerned by the contested decision.", "Telefónica submitted written observations on that objection of inadmissibility.", "14", "By the order under appeal, the General Court dismissed Telefónica’s action as inadmissible the basis of the second of the two pleas of inadmissibility raised by the Commission. onThe General Court held, in paragraph 41 of the order under appeal, that Telefónica is not individually concerned by the contested decision within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU and, in paragraph 45 of the order, that that decision cannot be classified as an act not entailing implementing measures within the meaning of the final limb of that provision.", "Consequently, the General Court dismissed Telefónica’s action without examining the first plea of inadmissibility, to the effect that Telefónica had no interest in bringing proceedings.", "Forms of order sought", "15", "Telefónica claims that the Court should:", "—", "set aside the order under appeal;", "—", "declare the action for annulment in Case T-228/10 admissible and refer the case back to the General Court for it to give judgment on the substance of the dispute; and", "—", "order the Commission to pay the costs ‘of the proceedings at both instances relating to admissibility’.", "16", "The Commission contends that the appeal should be dismissed and Telefónica ordered to pay the costs.", "The appeal", "17", "Telefónica relies on three pleas in law in support of its appeal.", "First, it complains that the General Court infringed its right to effective judicial protection.", "Second, it contends that the General Court misinterpreted the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU in holding that it is not individually concerned by the contested decision.", "Third, in its submission, the General Court interpreted incorrectly the concept of an act not entailing implementing measures within the meaning of the final limb of that provision.", "18", "The question whether Telefónica’s right to effective judicial protection is affected by the order under appeal arises only if the General Court declared its action inadmissible on the basis of a correct interpretation of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU.", "Consequently, the first plea relied upon by Telefónica in support of its appeal should not be examined until after its two other pleas, concerning errors of law committed by the General Court in interpreting that provision.", "19", "It is also to be recalled that the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU provides for two situations in which natural or legal persons are accorded standing to institute proceedings against an act not addressed to them.", "First, such proceedings may be instituted if the act is of direct and individual concern to them.", "Second, they may bring proceedings against a regulatory act not entailing implementing measures if that act is of direct concern to them.", "20", "If the contested decision were to be regarded as a regulatory act not entailing implementing measures, as Telefónica submits in its third plea, there would be no need for it to show that, as it contends in its second plea, it is individually concerned by that decision.", "It is accordingly appropriate to examine the third plea first.", "The third plea", "Arguments of the parties", "21", "Telefónica contends that the General Court erred in law in holding that State aid decisions such as the contested decision entail implementing measures within the meaning of the final limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU.", "22", "Telefónica states that the decision declaring an aid scheme incompatible with the common market has direct effect and does not require implementing measures in that it immediately renders the aid granted unlawful and normally entails an obligation on the Member State concerned to recover the aid.", "The measures subsequent to such a decision that may be necessary in order to discharge the obligation to recover the aid from certain beneficiaries, as referred to in Article 6(2) of the contested decision and taken into account by the General Court in paragraph 43 of the order under appeal, concern only an ancillary obligation that cannot call into question the direct effect of the articles of the operative part of that decision.", "In Telefónica’s submission, if it were accepted, as the General Court considers, that any measure, however minor it may be, that a Member State is required to adopt in order to give effect to a European Union act constitutes an implementing measure within the meaning of the final limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, a wide variety of regulatory acts would be automatically excluded from the scope of that provision, contrary to the objective pursued by the European Union legislature of facilitating access to the General Court for persons whose interests are affected by non-legislative acts adopted by the European Union institutions.", "23", "According to the Commission, the General Court did not err in law in concluding that the contested decision cannot be classified as an act not entailing implementing measures.", "24", "As the concept of implementing measures is not defined in the Treaties, it seems logical to interpret it literally, that is to say, to consider that it refers to any legal act necessary for implementation of another legal act.", "The literal meaning of that concept is equivalent to that adopted by Advocate General Jacobs in point 43 of his Opinion in Case C-50/00 P Unión de Pequeños Agricultores v Council [2002] ECR I-6677 in order to point out a possible gap in the European Union’s judicial system.", "According to the Commission, it is apparent from the documents relating to the work of the European Convention for the drawing up of a Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (OJ 2004 C 310, p. 1) that, when the provision which subsequently became the final limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU was drawn up, the founders’ intention was to fill that possible gap in the European Union’s judicial system.", "The Commission considers that the relaxing of the conditions relating to standing to bring proceedings thus reflected the intention that individuals should have a direct legal remedy against acts of general application, while, however, restricting that remedy to situations in which it is impossible for those individuals to contest the validity of an implementing act.", "25", "The Commission adds that, where a regulatory act requires an implementing measure, be it a national measure or a measure adopted at European Union level, the judicial protection of individuals is ensured because they can contest the legality of the implementing measure while raising, where appropriate, a plea of illegality relating to the basic regulatory act upon which such a measure is founded.", "It is therefore unnecessary for them to have standing to challenge the basic act directly.", "26", "As regards the contested decision, there is no doubt that a decision requiring a Member State to recover aid declared incompatible with the common market requires implementing measures.", "Such a decision is addressed solely to the Member State concerned and cannot give rise to an obligation of direct payment on the beneficiaries.", "The Commission recalls in this regard that, in accordance with the second sentence of the fourth paragraph of Article 288 TFEU, a decision which specifies those to whom it is addressed is to be binding only on them.", "It considers that, in order for an obligation to apply to the beneficiaries, it is necessary for the Member State to adopt implementing measures consisting in their being required to refund the aid that has been paid improperly.", "Furthermore, the contested decision imposes upon the Kingdom of Spain other implementing measures in addition to the obligation to recover aid, such as the obligation to bring the scheme at issue to an end.", "Findings of the Court", "27", "As the Advocate General has observed in points 40 and 41 of her Opinion, the concept of a ‘regulatory act which … does not entail implementing measures’, within the meaning of the final limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, is to be interpreted in the light of that provision’s objective, which, as is clear from its origin, consists in preventing an individual from being obliged to infringe the law in order to have access to a court.", "Where a regulatory act directly affects the legal situation of a natural or legal person without requiring implementing measures, that person could be denied effective judicial protection if he did not have a direct legal remedy before the European Union judicature for the purpose of challenging the legality of the regulatory act.", "In the absence of implementing measures, natural or legal persons, although directly concerned by the act in question, would be able to obtain a judicial review of that act only after having infringed its provisions, by pleading that those provisions are unlawful in proceedings initiated against them before the national courts.", "28", "It should be explained in this regard, first, that where a regulatory act entails implementing measures, judicial review of compliance with the European Union legal order is ensured irrespective of whether those measures are adopted by the European Union or the Member States.", "Natural or legal persons who are unable, because of the conditions governing admissibility laid down in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, to challenge a regulatory act of the European Union directly before the European Union judicature are protected against the application to them of such an act by the ability to challenge the implementing measures which the act entails.", "29", "Where responsibility for the implementation of such acts lies with the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the European Union, natural or legal persons are entitled to bring a direct action before the European Union judicature against the implementing acts under the conditions stated in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, and to plead in support of that action, pursuant to Article 277 TFEU, the illegality of the basic act at issue.", "Where that implementation is a matter for the Member States, those persons may plead the invalidity of the basic act at issue before the national courts and tribunals and cause the latter to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice, pursuant to Article 267 TFEU (Case C-583/11 P Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council [2013] ECR, paragraph 93).", "30", "Second, as the Advocate General has observed in point 48 of her Opinion, the question whether a regulatory act entails implementing measures should be assessed by reference to the position of the person pleading the right to bring proceedings under the final limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU.", "It is therefore irrelevant whether the act in question entails implementing measures with regard to other persons.", "31", "Third, in order to determine whether the measure being challenged entails implementing measures, reference should be made exclusively to the subject-matter of the action and, where an applicant seeks only the partial annulment of an act, it is solely any implementing measures which that part of the act may entail that must, as the case may be, be taken into consideration.", "32", "It is in the light of those explanations that the third plea relied upon by Telefónica in support of its appeal should be examined.", "33", "As the Advocate General has observed in point 33 of her Opinion, Telefónica’s action was concerned solely with challenging the declaration in Article 1(1) of the contested decision that the scheme at issue is partially incompatible with the common market, and did not criticise the recovery of the aid, ordered in Article 4(1) of that decision, or the other directions issued to the Kingdom of Spain in Article 6(2) thereof.", "34", "First, as the Advocate General has observed in point 48 of her Opinion, the declaration in Article 1(1) of the contested decision that the scheme at issue is partially incompatible with the common market is addressed solely to the Member State to which that decision is addressed, namely the Kingdom of Spain, and therefore the decision is not binding on other persons, in accordance with the fourth paragraph of Article 288 TFEU.", "35", "Second, Article 1(1) of the contested decision is concerned exclusively with declaring the scheme at issue incompatible with the common market.", "It does not define the specific consequences which that declaration has for each taxpayer.", "Those consequences will be embodied in administrative documents such as a tax notice, which constitutes as such an implementing measure that Article 1(1) of the contested decision ‘entails’ within the meaning of the final limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU.", "36", "Consequently, the General Court was correct in holding, in paragraph 44 of the order under appeal, that the measures for giving effect to the decision as to incompatibility – including in particular the measure consisting of rejection of an application for grant of the tax advantage at issue, a rejection which Telefónica will also be able to contest before the national courts – are implementing measures in respect of the contested decision.", "37", "Such a finding in itself justifies rejection of Telefónica’s line of argument before the General Court that the contested decision does not entail implementing measures.", "38", "The General Court was therefore correct in holding, in paragraph 45 of the order under appeal, that, irrespective of whether the contested decision is a regulatory act, the conditions governing admissibility laid down in the final limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU are not met in the case in point.", "39", "In the light of all these considerations, the third plea relied upon by Telefónica in support of its appeal should be dismissed.", "The second plea", "Arguments of the parties", "40", "In Telefónica’s submission, the General Court erred in law by reason of its overly restrictive interpretation of the concept of an actual beneficiary of an aid scheme that is the subject of a Commission decision, as is clear in particular from Joined Cases C-71/09 P, C-73/09 P and C-76/09 P Comitato ‘Venezia vuole vivere’ and Others v Commission [2011] ECR I-4727.", "Telefónica contends that, contrary to what the General Court held in paragraphs 24 and 25 of the order under appeal, the important point is not that a party who has in fact benefited from the aid in question is among those who must certainly repay aid; instead it would suffice for there to be a risk of his interests being seriously affected, as would be the case if he were led to be required to repay the aid.", "41", "Telefónica submits that it is exposed on two counts to the risk of having to repay the aid received notwithstanding the Commission’s acknowledgment that it entertained legitimate expectations.", "First, the exception to the obligation to recover, laid down in Article 1(2) and (3) of the contested decision, is the subject of an action for annulment before the General Court, in Case T-207/10 Deutsche Telekom v Commission which is pending before it.", "If that action were to be successful, Telefónica could be obliged to repay the aid that it has received.", "Second, the finding in the contested decision that the rules concerning the amortisation of goodwill constituted unlawful aid enables third parties in competition with the beneficiaries of the aid to bring actions at national level in order to obtain compensation for any loss suffered.", "42", "The Commission contends, on the other hand, that the case-law requires two conditions to be met in order for an applicant to be individually concerned in circumstances such as those here.", "First, the applicant must be an actual recipient of individual aid granted under an aid scheme.", "Second, he must be obliged to repay the aid in question or, at least, be exposed to the risk of having to repay it.", "Contrary to Telefónica’s assertions, it is not, on the other hand, sufficient that the applicant runs the risk of his interests being, in a more general way, seriously harmed.", "The Court rejected the proposition that an applicant is individually concerned simply by virtue of being the beneficiary of an aid scheme in Joined Cases 67/85, 68/85 and 70/85 Kwekerij van der Kooy and Others v Commission [1988] ECR 219, paragraph 15, and Case C-6/92 Federmineraria and Others v Commission [1993] ECR I-6357, paragraphs 11 to 16.", "43", "In the present case, there is in any event no risk of Telefónica having to repay the aid that it has received, or even of its interests being seriously harmed, because it was clear, from when the contested decision was adopted, that it would enjoy the benefit of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations.", "Findings of the Court", "44", "The contested decision is not addressed to Telefónica and, as is clear from paragraphs 34 to 36 of the present judgment, it entails implementing measures.", "45", "Under the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, natural or legal persons may institute proceedings against an act which is not addressed to them and entails implementing measures only if that act is of direct and individual concern to them.", "46", "As regards the second of those conditions, that is to say, being individually concerned by the act in question, it is settled case-law that persons other than those to whom a decision is addressed may claim to be individually concerned only if that decision affects them by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons and by virtue of these factors distinguishes them individually just as in the case of the person addressed (Case 25/62 Plaumann v Commission [1963] ECR 95, at 107; Comitato ‘Venezia vuole vivere’ and Others v Commission, paragraph 52; and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, paragraph 72).", "47", "As the General Court pointed out in paragraph 28 of the order under appeal, it is also clear from settled case-law that the possibility of determining more or less precisely the number, or even the identity, of the persons to whom a measure applies by no means implies that it must be regarded as being of individual concern to them as long as that measure is applied by virtue of an objective legal or factual situation defined by it (see, to this effect, Case C-451/98 Antillean Rice Mills v Council [2001] ECR I-8949, paragraph 52).", "48", "This is so in the case of Article 1(1) of the contested decision, whose annulment Telefónica seeks and in the light of which Telefónica’s standing to bring proceedings must therefore be examined.", "Article 1(1) applies to objectively determined situations and produces legal effects with respect to categories of persons viewed generally and in the abstract.", "Telefónica therefore cannot claim to be individually distinguished by that provision .", "49", "The sole effect of Article 1(1) of the contested decision is to prevent, in the future, any person from benefiting from the scheme at issue.", "It is settled case-law that an undertaking cannot, in principle, contest a Commission decision prohibiting an aid scheme if it is concerned by that decision solely by virtue of belonging to the sector in question and being a potential beneficiary of the scheme (see Joined Cases C-15/98 and C-105/99 Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission [2000] ECR I-8855, paragraph 33 and the case-law cited).", "50", "Accordingly, the General Court was correct in holding, in paragraph 41 of the judgment under appeal, that Telefónica is not individually concerned, within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, by Article 1(1) of the contested decision.", "51", "It follows from the foregoing that the second plea relied upon by Telefónica in support of its appeal must also be dismissed.", "The first plea", "Arguments of the parties", "52", "Telefónica submits that, in dismissing its action as inadmissible, the General Court failed to have regard to its right to effective judicial protection flowing from Articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed at Rome on 4 November 1950, and from Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.", "53", "Telefónica argues in particular that it is not possible for it to obtain a judicial review of Article 1(1) of the contested decision by way of preliminary objection, namely by provoking a dispute with the tax authorities and relying on the scheme at issue, even though it no longer forms part of the legislation in force in Spain, in order that the national court with jurisdiction refers to the Court for a preliminary ruling a question as to validity pursuant to subparagraph (b) of the first paragraph of Article 267 TFEU.", "That would require it to decide to commit an infringement of the law, that is to say, to act deliberately in a manner contrary to the legislation in force.", "In voluntarily breaching the law, it would not only be acting contrary to the codes of conduct to which it has agreed to adhere, but would also expose itself to a definite risk that the Spanish tax authorities would decide to exercise their power to impose penalties on the basis of a series of provisions of the applicable tax legislation.", "54", "The Commission states that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, the FEU Treaty, by Articles 263 TFEU and 277 TFEU, on the one hand, and Article 267 TFEU, on the other, has established a complete system of legal remedies and procedures designed to ensure judicial review of the legality of acts of the institutions, and has entrusted such review to the European Union judicature.", "55", "Telefónica’s submission that the General Court should have examined the circumstances in which it would in fact have been possible to seek judicial remedies at national level must moreover be rejected.", "It is not possible to accept an interpretation of the system of remedies to the effect that a direct action for annulment before the European Union judicature will be available where it can be shown, following an examination by the latter of the particular national procedural rules, that those rules do not allow the individual to bring proceedings to contest the validity of the European Union measure at issue.", "Such an interpretation would require the European Union judicature to examine and interpret national procedural law.", "That would go beyond its jurisdiction when reviewing the legality of acts of the European Union institutions.", "It is in any event not possible for an action for annulment before the European Union judicature to be available to an individual even if it turns out that the national procedural rules permit him to contest the validity of the European Union measure at issue only after he has infringed it.", "Findings of the Court", "56", "First of all, it is to be remembered that the European Union is a union based on the rule of law in which the acts of its institutions are subject to review of their compatibility with, in particular, the Treaties, general principles of law and fundamental rights (Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, paragraph 91).", "57", "Judicial review of compliance with the European Union legal order is ensured, as can be seen from Article 19(1) TEU, by the Court of Justice and the courts and tribunals of the Member States.", "To that end, the FEU Treaty has established, by Articles 263 TFEU and 277 TFEU, on the one hand, and Article 267 TFEU, on the other, a complete system of legal remedies and procedures designed to ensure judicial review of the legality of European Union acts, and has entrusted such review to the European Union judicature (Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, paragraphs 90 and 92).", "58", "As is clear from paragraphs 34 to 36 of the present judgment, the contested decision entails implementing measures, in the Member State concerned, with regard to Telefónica.", "59", "Consequently, even though Telefónica cannot, because of the conditions governing admissibility laid down in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, challenge the contested decision directly before the European Union judicature, it can contend that it is invalid before the national courts and cause the latter to refer questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling, pursuant to Article 267 TFEU, in particular by bringing before the national courts the administrative act which refuses it amortisation under the regime at issue.", "60", "It follows that the first plea relied upon by Telefónica in support of its appeal must be dismissed.", "61", "Since none of the three pleas raised by Telefónica in support of its appeal can be successful, the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.", "Costs", "62", "Under Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded the Court is to make a decision as to the costs.", "Article 138(1) of those Rules, which applies to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, provides that the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "63", "Since the Commission has applied for costs and Telefónica has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay the costs.", "On those grounds, the Court

new district (‘the aid at issue’).", "The investment costs of this project amounted to EUR 9 500 000 and the aid at issue amounted to EUR 3 800 000.", "9.", "By letter of 13 May 2003, the Commission notified the Italian Republic of its decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC with regard to the aid at issue.", "It was of the view that the aid at issue was

Cases T‑244/93 and T‑486/93 TWD v Commission [1995] ECR II‑2265, (‘the TWD v Commission case-law’) had to be applied.", "10.", "The Commission, in that regard, stated, first, that ACEA was one of the

June 2002 on State aid granted by Italy in the form of tax exemptions and subsidised loans to public utilities with a majority public capital holding (OJ 2003 L 77, p. 21) (‘the earlier decision’)

Article 3 of that decision.", "11.", "According to the Commission, ACEA was the initial beneficiary of the aid at issue, AEP having become the current beneficiary only following a series of

ACEA, had to be deemed to be the beneficiary of the aid at issue.", "12.", "On 16 March 2005, the Commission adopted the contested decision, by which it declared the aid at issue compatible with the

pointed out that the condition precedent for payment of the aid at issue could not therefore be regarded as having been fulfilled.", "19.", "In the judgment under appeal, the General Court dismissed the action .", "20.", "As regards the first plea, the General Court took the view that the Commission was entitled, without infringing Article 87(1) EC, to classify the aid at issue as State aid, since the local nature of the urban heating network concerned did not preclude either competitive relationships with other energy products or any adverse effect on trade between Member States, and that sufficient reasons were given for that finding.", "Moreover, the General Court rejected as inadmissible the arguments that the statement of reasons for the contested decision was contradictory

not, in its view, contain any argument relating to the purported infringements.", "In so far as the second plea alleged errors of law and that the statement of reasons for the contested decision was inadequate and contradictory as regards the identity of the beneficiary of the aid at issue, the General Court held, first, that the Commission had not committed a manifest error of assessment in holding that, for the purpose of examining the aid at issue, ACEA and AEP were to be regarded as an economic unit and that ACEA was to be deemed to be one of the beneficiaries of the aid at issue.",

plea, the General Court rejected the arguments alleging that ACEA and AEP were not one and the same and that the earlier aid and the aid at issue did not have a cumulative effect, by referring to the considerations set out in connection with its assessment of the second plea.", "It further held that, contrary to AEP’s submissions, the TWD v Commission case-law was also applicable to general aid schemes and not solely to individual aid.", "Lastly, the General Court found that the Commission had not failed to have regard to that decision by taking the view that it was not required to prove the

identification of the beneficiary of the aid at issue", "The first part of the first ground of appeal, alleging distortion of the pleas in law relied on at first instance", "– Arguments of the parties", "26.", "AEP is of the view that the finding that the second plea relied on at first instance was inadmissible, in that it alleged infringement of Article 88 EC and of Regulation No 659/1999,

the beneficiary of the aid at issue.", "The correct identification of the beneficiary, it claims, was relevant in the context of compliance with the rules of procedure governing State aid.", "27.", "According to AEP, the question whether there was economic continuity between ACEA and AEP as a result of the transfer of the branch of the undertaking which was responsible for the project that is the subject‑matter of the aid at issue was addressed in detail both in the parties’ written pleadings and at the hearing.", "However, the General Court failed to take account of that exchange of views, thereby distorting the plea relied on and the results of the investigations.", "– Findings of the Court", "28.", "It is settled case‑law that the General Court is obliged to reject as inadmissible a head of claim in an application brought before it if the essential matters of law and of fact on which the head of claim is based are not indicated coherently and intelligibly in the

ruling, to reject the argument alleging infringement of Article 88 EC and Regulation No 659/1999 as inadmissible on the ground that it did not satisfy those conditions.", "30.", "The application before the General Court failed to identify in a clear, unequivocal, coherent and intelligible manner in what way the contested decision infringed those provisions.", "Moreover, AEP has failed to produce before the Court of Justice any concrete evidence to demonstrate that the application presented before the General Court satisfied those conditions.", "31.", "In particular, it is not sufficient to claim that the reference to those provisions was to be read in conjunction with the arguments concerning the error in the identification of the beneficiary of the aid at issue, since the application at first instance did not make that connection clear or specify in what way the purported error would result in infringement of those provisions.", "32.", "Accordingly, the first part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected.", "The second part of the first ground of appeal, alleging errors of law", "– Arguments of the parties", "33.", "AEP submits that the General Court erred in law in upholding the Commission’s claim that ACEA and AEP form an economic unit.", "While ACEA has a holding of less than 30% in AEP, Electrabel has a 70% holding in that company, with the result that it is not possible to claim that AEP formed an economic unit together with ACEA.", "34.", "According to AEP, it is clear from all the case‑law cited by the General Court in support of its analysis that the discretion enjoyed by the Commission in determining whether, for the purpose of identifying the beneficiary of aid, two or more undertakings form an economic unit is restricted to cases in which the same person or group has sole control.", "On the other hand, in a case where, as here, an undertaking is controlled by a joint venture, which itself is controlled by two separate groups, it cannot be inferred from that case-law that the Commission is entitled to conclude that there is an economic unit between the controlled undertaking and one of the two companies which control the joint venture.", "35.", "AEP also considers that the Commission would never have adopted such an approach in other areas of competition law, even though that law applies the same concepts in all areas covered by it.", "Contrary to view taken by the General Court, the concepts applicable to concentrations or restrictive practices can be transposed to the field of State aid, except in certain specific situations in which a different interpretation is justified.", "36.", "In its decision approving AEP’s constitution, the Commission classified that joint venture as a concentration because it was an undertaking which operated independently of its parent companies.", "The concept of operational independence, however, is used, in competition law, for joint ventures which, albeit controlled by different economic groups, have their own organisational and administrative structure and operate on the market with independent operational and financial means.", "37.", "According to AEP, the General Court therefore erred in concluding at paragraph 142 of the judgment under appeal, in spite of that earlier finding by the Commission, that AEP did not have genuine operational independence vis-à-vis ACEA and Electrabel because it was jointly controlled by those companies.", "The General Court, it claims, confused the concepts of operational independence and control, since not all control affects the operational independence of an undertaking.", "38.", "Moreover, in so far as the General Court took the view, at paragraph 142 of the judgment under appeal, that AEP is not operationally independent because the energy which it produces is marketed by AE Trading, AEP observes that such considerations are irrelevant, given that the separation of production and wholesale marketing, carried out in this case by AEP, and retail marketing, carried out in this case by AE Trading, is common in the energy sector and the Commission was aware of this when it approved the concentration.", "39.", "AEP adds that, while the General Court stated that the Commission did not attribute any liability to AEP or request that it reimburse the earlier aid, the fact remains that AEP and, through its intermediary, Electrabel bear the consequences of the suspension of the aid at issue.", "If the Commission’s intention was to reach ACEA, through the intermediary of AEP, it should have avoided affecting the situation of Electrabel and, therefore, have suspended the aid at issue only to an extent commensurate with ACEA’s holding, namely 29.705%.", "40.", "The reference made by the General Court to Case C‑91/01 Italy v Commission [2004] ECR I‑4355, paragraphs 50 to 53, is, according to AEP, irrelevant, since the case which gave rise to that judgment concerned the issue of whether a company was entitled to preferential treatment granted to small and medium‑sized undertakings and not whether a company formed part of an economic unit.", "Moreover, at most, that case concerned exclusive control of a single group.", "41.", "In so far as the General Court found that there was economic continuity between ACEA and AEP as a result of the transfer of the branch of the undertaking which was responsible for the project that is the subject-matter of the aid at issue, AEP considers that that transfer is not sufficient for it to be established that it carries on the activities previously pursued by ACEA and that it became the beneficiary of that aid.", "Nor can that transfer provide any justification for the finding that AEP and ACEA form an economic unit.", "42.", "AEP states, in that connection, that the transfer of that project took place in the context of a joint venture agreement which marked the end of a tendering procedure organised by ACEA, in the course of which the branch of the undertaking transferred was appropriately evaluated in accordance with market rules.", "It is apparent from paragraph 33 of the Commission Notice entitled ‘Towards an effective implementation of Commission decisions ordering Member States to recover unlawful and incompatible State aid’ (OJ 2007 C 272, p. 4) that, in cases involving the transfer of assets (‘asset deals’), such as that in the present case, there is no continuity between the old and the new undertaking.", "43.", "With regard to the reasoning of the General Court concerning the possibility that the purpose of the transfer to AEP of the branch of undertaking in question from ACEA might have been to circumvent the recovery order in the contested decision, AEP points out that it stated before the General Court that an operation as important, from an economic and strategic point of view, as the formation of AceaElectrabel could not have been devised in order to avert the risk that State aid of such an insignificant amount, in relation to the overall value of the operation, might be suspended.", "44.", "Moreover, by finding, first, that it was not for the Commission to prove that the purpose was to circumvent the recovery order and, second, that the finding that there had been a transfer and the account of the risks which that entailed in the light of the rules on State aid constituted sufficient arguments on the part of the Commission, the General Court exempted the Commission from its obligation to state the reasons for its decisions other than by reference to hypothetical or paradoxical situations.", "45.", "At the hearing, Electrabel supported AEP’s arguments seeking to establish that there was no economic unity between AEP and ACEA and no intention to circumvent the recovery order in the earlier decision when the branch of the undertaking in question was transferred from ACEA to AEP.", "In particular, Electrabel submits that any risk of circumvention must be evaluated not in the abstract but on the basis of concrete facts.", "– Findings of the Court", "46.", "Since AEP and Electrabel challenge the General Court’s finding that the Commission was entitled to consider AEP and ACEA as forming an economic unit for the purpose of the earlier aid and the aid at issue, it is necessary to determine whether that court was entitled, without erring in law, to confirm the contested decision on that point.", "47.", "According to the established case‑law of the Court, following a restructuring entailing a transfer of production facilities from one company to other newly constituted manufacturing companies, since the former company continues to have an interest in those newly constituted manufacturing companies, all those companies may, as far as the aid granted is concerned, together form a single group, notwithstanding the fact that each of the newly constituted manufacturing companies has a legal personality separate from the former company (see, to that effect, Case 323/82 Intermills v Commission [1984] ECR 3809, paragraph 11).", "48.", "The former company and the new operating companies can form an economic unit, inter alia, where the restructuring carried out constitutes an indivisible whole, from an industrial and economic point of view (see, to that effect, Intermills v Commission , paragraph 12).", "49.", "It is also apparent from the Court’s case‑law that an entity which, owning controlling shareholdings in a company, actually exercises that control by involving itself directly or indirectly in the management thereof must be regarded as taking part in the economic activity carried on by the controlled undertaking (Case C‑222/04 Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others [2006] ECR I‑289, paragraphs 112 and 118).", "50.", "If that is not the case, the simple separation of an undertaking into two different entities, the first of which pursues directly the former economic activity and the second of which controls the first, being fully involved in its management, would be sufficient to deprive the rules of the European Union relating to State aid of their practical effect.", "It would enable the second entity to benefit from subsidies or other advantages granted by the State or by means of State resources and to use them in whole or in part for the benefit of the former, in the interest, also, of the economic unit formed by the two entities ( Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others , paragraph 114).", "51.", "What may reveal that it is possible to exercise functions relating to control, direction and financial support – going beyond the simple placing of capital by an investor – and illustrate the existence of organic and functional links between an entity owning a controlling shareholding in a company and the controlled company itself, is the fact that members of the management committee and the controlling body of that entity are appointed to the equivalent bodies of the controlled company (see, to that effect, Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others , paragraphs 116 and 117).", "52.", "In the present case, neither AEP nor Electrabel have disputed the following findings of the General Court: first, that court found, at paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that ACEA was the original beneficiary of the aid at issue, that the branch of the undertaking receiving that aid was transferred from ACEA to AEP and that the latter carries on the activity of that branch of the undertaking.", "The General Court also stated, at paragraph 142 of the judgment under appeal, that the marketing of the energy produced by AEP was carried out by AE Trading, in which AceaElectrabel has a 84.17% holding, ACEA having, in turn, a 59.41% holding in AceaElectrabel.", "53.", "Second, the General Court stated, at paragraph 109 of the judgment under appeal, that AEP is linked to both ACEA and Electrabel and that ACEA holds a majority of the capital in AceaElectrabel, which itself holds 50% of the capital in AEP and, at paragraph 111 of the judgment, that ACEA expressly affirmed that it has joint control over AEP, together with Electrabel.", "54.", "Third, the General Court pointed out, at paragraph 119 of the judgment under appeal, that, although Electrabel is represented by eight members out of twelve on AEP’s board of directors and by four members out of six on its executive committee, the agreement of one of the members representing ACEA is required for the most important matters, which gives it the power to block decisions.", "55.", "It is apparent from the case‑law cited at paragraphs 47 and 48 above that, in such circumstances, the Commission was entitled to take the view, without overstepping the bounds of its discretion, that, following the restructuring carried out by ACEA with the support of Electrabel, ACEA and AEP form part of an indivisible whole in so far as the earlier aid and the aid at issue are concerned, since that restructuring entailed the transfer of the branch of the undertaking in question from ACEA to AEP, AEP continued the activities of that branch of the undertaking, ACEA retained an interest in AEP and the energy generated by AEP was marketed by AE Trading, which was controlled by ACEA through its majority holding in AceaElectrabel.", "56.", "Moreover, in the light of the case‑law referred to at paragraphs 49 and 51 above, it is apparent from those findings that the Commission was entitled to take the view that, since it had holdings giving it joint control in AEP, ACEA in fact exercised that control by involving itself directly or indirectly in the management of that company by means of both the presence of its representatives on AEP’s board of directors and on its executive committee and its majority holding in AceaElectrabel, which in turn held 50% of the capital in AEP.", "57.", "Moreover, the General Court pointed out, at paragraph 125 of the judgment under appeal, first, that the agreement allocating the branch of the undertaking transferred from ACEA to AEP contained a clause precluding any possible dispute concerning that branch and, second, that ACEA had already, at that point, contested the earlier decision.", "58.", "In such circumstances, the General Court cannot be criticised for having erred in taking the view, at paragraph 130 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission has established in the present case that the restructuring carried out by ACEA together with Electrabel could have given rise to the risk of circumvention of the recovery order in the earlier decision.", "59.", "First, it must be concluded that, contrary to what is claimed by AEP and Electrabel, the risk that the order for recovery of the earlier aid might be circumvented cannot be taken into account only where such an objective can be proved to exist in the factual circumstances of the case.", "If that were so, undertakings would be encouraged to devise company structures designed to circumvent the recovery of unlawful aid by taking advantage of the fact that the burden of proving that such an objective was being pursued lay with the Commission.", "60.", "The General Court therefore acted correctly in finding that it was sufficient for the Commission to show that there was such a risk in the present case.", "61.", "Second, the Commission was entitled to take the view that, in the absence of any finding that it formed an economic unit with ACEA, AEP could, following the restructuring carried out and under the joint control of ACEA, pursue the transferred activity which had benefited from the earlier aid and obtain the aid at issue.", "The Commission was also entitled to find that ACEA was able to benefit from the aid at issue granted to AEP, given that they pursued their respective economic activities as an indivisible whole.", "62.", "In the light of the case‑law cited at paragraph 50 above, if ACEA had been able to benefit from the aid at issue, that would have been sufficient to deprive the rules of the European Union on State aid of their practical effect and would also have been incompatible with the reasoning of the TWD v Commission case-law.", "63.", "Accordingly, the General Court was entitled to form the view, without erring in law, that the Commission, which has broad discretion in this field, did not commit a manifest error of assessment in concluding that ACEA and AEP formed an economic unit in so far as the earlier aid and the aid at issue are concerned.", "64.", "In particular, the General Court was entitled to consider that the fact that ACEA exercised control over AEP only in conjunction with Electrabel and that Electrabel had a greater share in the capital of AEP than in that of ACEA did not, in the circumstances, preclude the Commission from concluding that ACEA and AEP formed such an economic unit.", "65.", "That conclusion cannot be affected by the other arguments put forward by AEP.", "66.", "First, it must be concluded that, in the light of the above analysis, the arguments relating to, first, the Commission’s finding in its assessment of the concentration that AEP was operationally independent of ACEA and, second, the concept of an economic unit as applied in the field of restrictive practices and concentrations, cannot be accepted.", "Indeed, as the General Court correctly held at paragraphs 135, 137 and 138 of the judgment under appeal, the concept of an economic unit in State aid matters can differ from that applicable in other areas of competition law.", "67.", "In any event, neither any operational independence on the part of AEP nor the concept of an economic unit applicable in the field of restrictive practices and concentrations is capable of altering the fact that in the light, in particular, of ACEA’s power to block decisions for the most important matters concerning the management of AEP, the General Court was entitled, in the circumstances, to confirm the Commission’s finding that ACEA exercised joint control over AEP and that the latter formed part of an indivisible whole.", "68.", "Second, with regard to the argument relating to the transfer of the branch of the undertaking in question to AEP as part of a purported transfer of assets (‘asset deal’), suffice it to note that the rules governing that kind of transaction cannot be applied in circumstances such as those in the present case, in which ACEA retained joint control over the branch of the undertaking in question and could therefore be regarded as forming an economic unit together with AEP.", "69.", "Third, as regards the argument relating to the reference made by the General Court to the judgment in Case C‑91/01 Italy v Commission , it is clear from the considerations set out at paragraphs 55 to 64 above that, even if that reference were incorrect, as AEP claims, the General Court was nevertheless entitled to conclude that it was possible for the Commission to find that ACEA and AEP formed an economic unit.", "Accordingly, that argument is ineffective.", "70.", "Fourth, as regards the argument that the aid at issue should have been suspended only to an extent commensurate with ACEA’s share in the capital of AEP, suffice it to point out that, on the grounds set out at paragraph 61 above, the Commission and the General Court were entitled to consider that all aid, even in a small amount, granted to AEP was capable of conferring advantages on ACEA.", "71.", "In the light of all the foregoing, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected.", "The third part of the first ground of appeal, alleging that the reasoning of the judgment under appeal was irrational and contradictory", "– Arguments of the parties", "72.", "AEP criticises the General Court for having simply adopted as its own all the Commission’s arguments without pointing out their inherent contradiction or the manifest error of law and assessment vitiating those arguments.", "73.", "In particular, AEP is of the view that, since the General Court acknowledged that AEP is controlled by two separate groups and that, within those two groups, Electrabel has the greatest shareholding, its conclusion that AEP and ACEA have one and the same control centre is contradictory, arbitrary and illogical, since a sole company cannot, logically, form a single economic unit with two separate legal personalities.", "74.", "Furthermore, no explanation capable of clarifying its implications has been given for the General Court’s finding that AEP is not operationally independent because AE Trading markets the energy which it produces.", "75.", "AEP is of the view that it is unrealistic and illogical to consider, as the General Court did, that AceaElectrabel was conceived in order to circumvent the rules applicable to State aid and that it was not for the Commission to prove that that was the objective, but that the finding that there had been a transfer and the account of the risks which that entailed in the light of the rules on State aid constituted sufficient reasoning on the part of the Commission.", "76.", "According to AEP, the General Court also contradicted itself by taking the view, at paragraph 140 of the judgment under appeal, that in order to determine whether there is an economic unit, it is necessary to take account of the stake held by the undertaking concerned in a group of companies, over which control is exercised directly or indirectly by one of those companies, and whether a single group controlled by one entity has been formed, whereas the General Court itself found that AEP was controlled by two separate entities.", "– Findings of the Court", "77.", "It is settled case‑law that the duty incumbent upon the General Court under Article 36 and the first paragraph of Article 53 of the Statute of the Court of Justice to state reasons for its judgments does not require the General Court to provide an account that follows exhaustively and one by one all the arguments articulated by the parties to the case.", "The reasoning may therefore be implicit, on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why the measures in question were taken and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its powers of review (Case C‑431/07 P Bouygues and Bouygues Télécom v Commission [2009] ECR I‑2665, paragraph 42, and order of 21 January 2010 in Case C‑150/09 P Iride and Iride Energia v Commission , not published in the ECR, paragraph 42).", "78.", "In the present case, it need merely be observed that the reasoning followed by the General Court is clear and intelligible and is such as to enable both AEP and Electrabel to know why the General Court rejected the pleas in question and to provide the Court with sufficient material to enable it to exercise its powers of review.", "79.", "In particular, it should be noted that the purported inconsistencies alleged by ACEA in the reasoning of the General Court relate in fact to the same purported errors in law which have already been examined and rejected in connection with the second part of the first ground of appeal, and do not relate to defective reasoning.", "80.", "Accordingly, the third part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected, as must, consequently, the first ground of appeal in its entirety.", "The second ground of appeal, concerning the scope of the TWD v Commission case-law", "The first part of the second ground of appeal, alleging distortion of the pleas in law relied on at first instance", "– Arguments of the parties", "81.", "AEP submits that, by stating, at paragraph 172 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was not required, in the earlier decision, to analyse aid individually granted under a scheme, the General Court distorted the third plea relied on in the application seeking to establish that, to order recovery of individual aid granted under a scheme, it is necessary first to ascertain the individual situation of each undertaking concerned.", "82.", "According to AEP, it is essential to determine, before a recovery order is made, whether and to what extent each undertaking belonging to the category affected by the scheme in question benefited from aid that is incompatible with the rules of the EC Treaty.", "In the present case, however, no such assessment has yet been made.", "– Findings of the Court", "83.", "As regards those claims, it need merely be noted, first, that it is apparent from a reading of paragraphs 23 to 28 of the application at first instance and paragraphs 147 to 151 of the judgment under appeal that the General Court faithfully summarised the arguments put forward by AEP and, second, that the General Court addressed those arguments at paragraphs 164 to 181 of that judgment.", "84.", "In particular, it is clear from the final section of paragraph 25 of the application at first instance that AEP argued in particular that, in order for it to be able to claim as against ACEA and AEP that the earlier aid received by ACEA was unlawful, the Commission should have examined, in the earlier decision, the application of the earlier aid schemes to ACEA and that, having failed to carry out such an examination, it was not entitled to put forward such a claim of illegality.", "85.", "The General Court cannot therefore be criticised for having distorted the third plea relied on at first instance when it responded to the arguments put forward by AEP, in particular by its finding at paragraph 172 of the judgment under appeal that the Commission was not required in the earlier decision to analyse aid granted on an individual basis under those schemes.", "86.", "It follows that the first part of the second ground of appeal must be rejected.", "The second part of the second ground of appeal, alleging errors of law", "– Arguments of the parties", "87.", "First, AEP submits that the TWD v Commission case-law, which concerns the assessment of the effects of cumulative aid on an undertaking, can be applied only in relation to one and the same undertaking.", "AEP argues that it has, however, shown, in the context of the first ground of appeal, that ACEA and AEP itself cannot be regarded as forming part of an economic unit.", "The General Court therefore incorrectly confirmed the contested decision, in so far as it applied that case-law.", "88.", "Second, AEP is of the view that, in order to demonstrate that the cumulation of the earlier aid and the aid at issue could have had adverse effects, the General Court should have verified that ACEA had in fact received unlawful aid, since that verification was carried out neither by the Italian Republic nor by the Commission.", "89.", "According to AEP, since it is apparent from the reasoning of the General Court that the Commission’s analysis should have taken into account, in particula r, the effects of the aid on ACEA, the General Court distorted the TWD v Commission case-law by creating a new condition of compatibility which is not laid down by the Treaty and which seeks to impose penalties where earlier aid has not been repaid.", "Instead of taking account of any possible cumulative effect as a simple factor in assessing whether or not the aid at issue is compatible with the common market, the General Court applied that decision and transformed it into an instrument for securing reimbursement of the earlier aid, while at the same time ensuring that the company which received the earlier aid should not enjoy any further advantage, even of an indirect nature, until that aid had been reimbursed.", "The General Court failed to define its position on that fundamental objection and rejected it, at paragraph 188 of the judgment under appeal, in a statement given for the sake of completeness and which is based on mere hypotheses.", "90.", "AEP states that, at the time when the contested decision was adopted, it was impossible to operate on the presumption of the existence of a cumulative effect or to assess its importance.", "When it examines an aid scheme, the Commission can choose either to proceed on a case-by-case basis or simply to carry out a general abstract assessment.", "If it chooses the second option, the means available to it for ensuring that the Member State concerned has implemented the decision are confined to actions for failure to comply with obligations, since the TWD v Commission case-law was not designed to provide it with an alternative means of imposing penalties.", "91.", "AEP takes the view that, since the aim of that decision is to prevent the beneficiary of new aid from enjoying an excessive advantage on the market as a result of its failure to reimburse earlier unlawful aid, the application of that decision requires a specific and detailed examination of the advantages conferred by the new aid, which should be conducted by way of specific reference to the position of the recipient undertaking on the market in question relative to that of its competitors and to trends in Community trade.", "92.", "Accordingly, AEP takes the view that, in order to be able to suspend payment of the new aid, the Commission should have come to the informed conclusion that the distortion of competition and trade arising from the combined effect of the two aid measures in the sectors in question would be such that the adverse effects of the new aid would prevail over the positive effects, thereby making it impossible to authorise the new aid until the initial aid had been reimbursed.", "93.", "Accordingly, in so far as it took the view, at paragraph 186 of the judgment under appeal, that the TWD v Commission case-law does not require the Commission to establish that the combined effect of the two aid measures is such as to affect trade but that the mere possibility alone is sufficient, the General Court erred in law.", "94.", "Third, according to AEP, the General Court erred in law in considering that the Member State and the undertaking receiving new aid are required to provide the Commission with evidence to show that the new aid and earlier unlawful aid which has not been repaid do not have any cumulative effect.", "While the Member State concerned is under a duty to provide the Commission with evidence capable of demonstrating that new aid is compatible with the common market, neither that Member State nor the undertaking concerned is required, according to AEP, to provide negative evidence, that is to say, evidence that the cumulation of the aid measures in question has no effect on trade.", "– Findings of the Court", "95.", "First, it should be borne in mind that the argument that ACEA and AEP are two separate economic entities in so far as the earlier aid and the aid at issue are concerned was rejected in the context of the examination of the second part of the first ground of appeal.", "It was also pointed out in that examination that the General Court did not, therefore, err in law in finding that the Commission was entitled to form the view that the grant of the aid at issue to AEP enabled ACEA to benefit from it.", "96.", "Next, it is clear from the Court’s case‑law that the need to prevent the cumulative effect of aid that has not been repaid and of aid which is planned is the same, regardless of whether individual aid or aid covered by an aid scheme is in issue, and that the TWD v Commission case-law allows the Commission to make compatibility of aid conditional upon prior repayment of earlier unlawful aid (see, to that effect, the order in Iride and Iride Energia v Commission, paragraphs 49, 50 and 70).", "97.", "First, the Commission must, where appropriate, take into account any cumulative effect of the earlier unlawful aid that has not been repaid and the new aid (see, to that effect, Case C‑355/95 P TWD v Commission , paragraphs 26 and 27) and, second, it can find that the new aid is compatible with the common market only when the evidence at its disposal enables it to reach such a conclusion (see, to that effect, the order in Iride and Iride Engergia v Commission , paragraph 70).", "98.", "In the present case, the General Court found, first, that the Commission had at its disposal evidence indicating that ACEA had benefited from the earlier aid and, second, that the Commission did not have at its disposal evidence from which it could conclude that the cumulation of the earlier aid and the aid at issue was not unlawful and incompatible with the common market.", "99.", "As the General Court correctly pointed out at paragraph 187 of the judgment under appeal, it is apparent from the TWD v Commission case-law that, where the Commission decides to initiate a formal investigation procedure, it is for the Member State and the potential beneficiary of new aid to provide the Commission with evidence capable of showing that the aid is compatible with the common market and that obligation also extends to the need to establish that the new aid and the earlier unlawful aid that is incompatible with the common market and has not been repaid do not have a cumulative effect.", "100.", "The General Court was therefore correct in finding that, since the earlier decision related to an aid scheme and not to individual aid, with the result that it fell to the Italian Republic to determine the amounts to be repaid by the beneficiaries of that scheme, it was for the latter, ACEA and AEP to communicate to the Commission, in the procedure which led to the contested decision, the amounts to be repaid and, if any, actually repaid in respect of the earlier aid, in order to demonstrate, if relevant, that there had not been any accumulation of unlawful aid.", "101.", "Since the Commission was not provided with any such information, it follows that the General Court cannot be criticised for finding, on the basis of the TWD v Commission case-law, that it was not for the Commission, in those circumstances, to determine precisely the amount of earlier aid received by ACEA prior to any suspension of payment of the aid at issue.", "102.", "Lastly, since it is clear from the Court’s case‑law that it is sufficient for the Commission to establish that the aid at issue is capable of affecting trade between Member States and distorting competition (order in Iride and Iride Energia v Commission , paragraph 72), the General Court acted correctly in finding that the Commission was not required, in the circumstances of the case, to carry out a specific detailed examination of the advantages to be derived from the aid at issue by referring specifically to the position of AEP and ACEA on the market in question relative to that of their competitors, and to trends in Community trade.", "103.", "In the light of all the foregoing, it is clear that the reasoning of the General Court is not vitiated by any error of law and that the second part of the second ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.", "The third part of the second ground of appeal, alleging contradictory and inadequate reasoning in the judgment under appeal", "– Arguments of the parties", "104.", "AEP points out that, at paragraph 179 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court acknowledges that it could not say with any certainty that ACEA had received aid that was incompatible with the rules of the Treaty.", "AEP therefore fails to understand why, in the following paragraph of that judgment, the General Court expressed the view that the mention in ACEA’s financial report of the possibility that a certain sum might have to be repaid constituted sufficient reasoning on the part of the Commission.", "105.", "AEP considers paragraph 186 of the judgment under appeal to be unclear and paragraph 187 thereof to be inexplicable and not properly reasoned.", "Further, it claims, paragraph 188 of that judgment is not reasoned.", "106.", "AEP adds, in that connection, that, since the reasoning set out by the General Court in those paragraphs suggests that it took the view that the Commission had not received from the Italian Republic the information necessary to enable it to carry out its examination, the General Court ought to have addressed the argument put forward at the hearing that, in such a case, the Commission cannot take a decision on the basis of the information at its disposal alone but is required to follow the procedure laid down in Article 5 of Regulation No 659/1999.", "The General Court, however, failed to address that argument.", "– Findings of the Court", "107.", "It has been pointed out, at paragraph 77 above, that the duty incumbent upon the General Court to state reasons for its judgments does not require it to address expressly all the arguments articulated by the parties and that the reasoning is sufficient where it enables the persons concerned to know why the measures in question were taken and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its powers of review.", "108.", "In the present case, it is sufficient, first, to observe that the reasoning of the General Court is clear and intelligible and is such as to enable both AEP and Electrabel to know why the General Court rejected the plea in question and to provide the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its powers of review.", "109.", "In particular, the General Court explained, at paragraph 180 of the judgment under appeal, why, in its opinion, the Commission was entitled take the view, notwithstanding AEP’s arguments examined at paragraph 179 of that judgment, that ACEA had benefited from earlier unlawful aid.", "Moreover, it is clear from paragraphs 186 to 188 of the judgment under appeal that the General Court set out therein its interpretation of the TWD v Commission case-law.", "110.", "Second, it is apparent from the case-file that AEP did not put forward the argument referred to at paragraph 106 above at the stage of the written procedure before the General Court but did so for the first time at the hearing before that Court, a fact which AEP itself acknowledges.", "In those circumstances, the view must be taken that this constituted a new argument directed at the annulment of the contested decision.", "111.", "It is apparent from the case‑file that that argument did not expand on an argument raised previously, whether directly or by implication, in the original application which is closely connected to the original complaint.", "However, Articles 48(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court provides that no new plea in law may be introduced in the course of proceedings unless it is based on matters of law or of fact which come to light in the course of the procedure (see, to that effect, the judgment of 12 November 2009 in Case C‑564/08 P SGL Carbon v Commission , not published in the ECR, paragraphs 20 to 34).", "112.", "Accordingly, since the argument referred to in paragraph 106 of the present judgment was not based on new matters which came to light during the procedure, the General Court cannot be criticised for having failed to address that argument expressly.", "113.", "Moreover, in so far as AEP presented that argument for the first time at the stage of the written procedure before the Court of Justice, it follows from settled case‑law that to allow a party to put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it has not raised before the General Court would in effect allow that party to bring before the Court a wider case than that heard by the General Court.", "In an appeal, the Court’s jurisdiction is, as a general rule, confined to a review of the assessment by the General Court of the pleas argued before it (see, inter alia, Case C‑97/08 P Akzo Nobel and Others v Commission [2009] ECR I‑8237, paragraph 38, and the order in Iride and Iride Energia v Commission , paragraph 32).", "114.", "Consequently, the third part of the second ground of appeal must be rejected, as must, therefore, the second ground of appeal in its entirety.", "115.", "It follows that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.", "Costs", "116.", "Under Article 69(2) of the Court’s Rules of Procedure, which applies to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 118 of those Rules, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "Since the Commission has applied for costs and AEP has been unsuccessful, AEP must be ordered to pay the costs.", "Moreover, since Electrabel has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs.", "Operative part", "On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby:", "1.", "Dismisses the appeal;", "2.", "Orders AceaElectrabel

Açúcar Portugueses (ARAP), Alcântara Refinarias - Açúcares SA and Refinarias de Açúcar Reunidas SA (RAR) brought an appeal under Article 49 of the EC Statute of the Court of Justice against the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 17 June 1999 in Case T-82/96 ARAP and Others v Commission [1999] ECR II-1889 (the judgment under appeal), by which that Court dismissed their application for annulment of the Commission decision of 11 January 1996 not to raise objections to State aid in favour of Sociedade de Desenvolvimento Agro-Industrial SA (DAI) notified under No N11/95 (hereinafter the contested decision or the contested measure), and of the Commission's letter of 19 March 1996, informing the applicants of that decision (hereinafter the letter of 19 March 1996).", "Legal background", "2 According to the first paragraph of Article 42 of the EC Treaty (now the first paragraph of Article 36 EC), [t]he provisions of the Chapter relating to rules on competition shall apply to production of and trade in agricultural products only to the extent determined by the Council ... , account being taken of the objectives [of the common agricultural policy] set out in Article 39.", "3 In that connection, Article 44 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (OJ 1981 L 177, p. 4) provides: [s]ave as otherwise provided in this Regulation, Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty shall apply to the production of, and trade in, the products listed in Article 1(1), which include in particular beet sugar and cane sugar, and also sugar beet and sugar cane.", "Under Article 45 of that regulation, it is to be applied so that appropriate account is taken, at the same time, of the objectives set out in Articles 39 and 110 of the Treaty.", "4 Under Article 26 of Annex I, Chapter XIV(c), of the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic and the adjustments to the Treaties (OJ 1985 L 302, p. 23, hereinafter the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic), a quota for beet sugar production of 60 000 tonnes per year was allocated to the Portuguese Republic.", "That quota was intended for undertakings established in mainland Portugal which were likely to start up sugar production.", "It was raised to 70 000 tonnes by Council Regulation (EC) No 1599/96 of 30 July 1996 amending Regulation No 1785/81 (OJ 1996 L 206, p. 43).", "5 With a view to strengthening economic and social cohesion in accordance with Article 130a of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 158 EC), Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (OJ 1988 L 185, p. 9) entrusts the Structural Funds with inter alia the tasks of promoting the development and structural adjustment of the regions whose development is lagging behind (Objective 1), speeding up the adjustment of agricultural structures (Objective 5(a)) and promoting the development of rural areas (Objective 5(b)).", "According to the Annex to that regulation, Portugal in its entirety is regarded as a region covered by Objective 1.", "6 The Council laid down provisions for implementing Regulation No 2052/88 as regards the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guidance Section, in its Regulation (EEC) No 4256/88 of 19 December 1988 (OJ 1988 L 374, p. 25).", "7 Pursuant to Article 10 of Regulation No 4256/88, the Council laid down the forms of and the conditions for the contribution by the Guidance Section of the EAGGF to measures to improve conditions under which agricultural products are processed and marketed, with a view to achieving the objectives of Regulation No 2052/88, in its Regulation (EEC) No 866/90 of 29 March 1990 on improving the processing and marketing conditions for agricultural products (OJ 1990 L 91, p. 1).", "8 Article 1(1) of Regulation No 866/90, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 3669/93 of 22 December 1993 (OJ 1993 L 338, p. 26, hereinafter Regulation No 866/90), introduces a common measure under Objective 5(a), which is also designed to help to achieve Objectives 1 and 5(b).", "9 Regulation No 866/90 provides for the adoption by the Commission of selection criteria, which, under Article 8(1), are to be used to determine which investments are to receive assistance from the EAGGF Guidance Section, laying down priorities and indicating those investments which must be excluded from Community financing.", "Under Article 8(2), [t]he selection criteria shall be drawn up in accordance with the guidelines of the Community's policies, particularly the common agricultural policy.", "10 Pursuant to Article 8(3) of Regulation No 866/90, the Commission adopted Decision 94/173/EC of 22 March 1994 on the selection criteria to be adopted for investments for improving the processing and marketing conditions for agricultural and forestry products and repealing Decision 90/342/EEC (OJ 1994 L 79, p. 29).", "According to the preamble to that decision the selection criteria reflect the guidelines of the common agricultural policy (seventh recital) and their application should take account of the duly justified specific needs of certain local productions (fifth recital).", "Paragraph 2.8 of the Annex to that decision excludes all investments concerning sugar ... with the exception of those which provide for:", "- ...", "- utilisation of the quota provided for in the Act of Accession of Portugal (for mainland Portugal, 60 000 tonnes of sugar).", "11 Under Article 16(5) of Regulation No 866/90, [w]ithin the field of application of this Regulation, Member States may take aid measures which are subject to conditions or rules concerning granting which differ from those provided for in this Regulation, or, where the amounts of aid exceed the ceilings specified herein, on condition that such measures comply with Articles 92 to 94 of the EC Treaty.", "12 According to the Commission communication of 12 July 1994 regarding State aid for investments in the processing and marketing of agricultural products (OJ 1994 C 189, p. 5, hereinafter the communication of 12 July 1994), when applying those provisions of the Treaty to State aid measures, the Commission will apply by analogy inter alia the sectoral restrictions governing the part-financing of such investments by the Community.", "That rule of assessment was reiterated in the Commission communication of 23 March 1995, concerning State aid in that sector (OJ 1995 C 71, p. 6, hereinafter the communication of 23 March 1995) and in that of 2 February 1996 on the same subject (OJ 1996 C 29, p. 4, hereinafter the communication of 2 February 1996).", "According to the last communication all State aid relating to the investments referred to in point 2.8 of the Annex to Decision 94/173 is excluded if the particular conditions laid down therein are not fulfilled.", "Background to the dispute", "13 In the contested decision, notified to the Portuguese Government by letter of 11 January 1996, the Commission raised no objection under Article 92 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 87 EC) and Article 93 of the EC Treaty (now Article 88 EC) with regard to State aid N11/95 granted by the Portuguese Republic to DAI's investment project for the establishment of a beet sugar refining plant at Coruche (Portugal) in the Tagus and Sorraia valley.", "14 That investment project was intended for the production of the white sugar quota allocated to the Portuguese Republic by the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic.", "15 The procedure for examination by the Commission of the aid in favour of DAI was as follows: initially, the Portuguese authorities notified the aid with a view to obtaining financial assistance from the Structural Funds.", "That application for Community aid, submitted first to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), was amended for subsequent submission to the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guidance Section, since it had to be examined under the rules relating not to industry but to the agricultural sector.", "16 The cane sugar refineries Alcântara Refinarias - Açúcares SA and Refinarias de Açúcar Reunidas SA (RAR), which were then the only sugar producers established in mainland Portugal, and the association of which those two refineries were members, Associação dos Refinadores de Açúcar Portugueses (ARAP), lodged complaints against the aid granted to DAI.", "17 Following those complaints, the Portuguese authorities subsequently also notified that aid under Article 93(3) of the Treaty.", "18 The aid granted to DAI is of three kinds.", "19 A first grant of aid of PTE 1 275 290 000 takes the form of tax reliefs granted under the general aid scheme introduced in Portugal by Decree-Law No 95/90 of 20 March 1990 amending the Estatuto dos Beneficios Fiscais (Tax benefits measure) and introducing a scheme specifically for large-scale investment projects.", "The scheme provides for special tax reliefs, limited to a period of 10 years, for companies making investments in excess of PTE 10 000 million.", "The maximum aid available is 10% of the net investments made or, in exceptional cases, 20%.", "20 The scheme introduced by Decree-Law No 95/90 was approved pursuant to Article 92 of the Treaty by Commission decision of 3 July 1991 (SG (91) D/13312) (hereinafter the decision of 3 July 1991), notified to the Portuguese Government on 15 July 1991, subject to the condition that the individual aid was in conformity with the rules and guidelines laid down by Community law in relation to certain industrial, agricultural and fisheries sectors.", "The approval decision also required the Portuguese Government to notify all projects enjoying reliefs of between 10 and 20% (ESL) and all those in sensitive sectors.", "That general aid scheme remained in force until 31 December 1995.", "By decision notified to the Portuguese Government on 30 May 1996 the Commission approved extension of the scheme under the same conditions until 1999, but removed the obligation to give notice of projects in sensitive sectors, which was no longer mentioned.", "21 In the contested decision the Commission first noted that the public investment aid granted in the form of tax reliefs in favour of DAI was granted in accordance with the aid scheme set up by Decree-Law 95/90.", "It went on to observe that that part of the aid did not exceed 10% of the investment and that the Community rules applicable to the agricultural sector, to which its decision of 3 July 1991 made reference, did not, in those circumstances, require the prior notification referred to in Article 93(3) of the Treaty.", "Finally, having explained that its examination, under Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty, of the part relating to investments involved verification of compliance with the Community provisions on State aid in the agricultural sector, the Commission stated that the tax reliefs in question were not excluded by Decision 94/173.", "22 A second grant of aid of PTE 380 000 000 for vocational training for staff at the new refinery was regarded as compatible with the common market.", "The contested decision indicated in that regard that, according to Commission practice, measures of this kind intended to impart new knowledge are authorised for up to 100% of the eligible expenses and that, [i]n this case, the aid does not exceed 68% of eligible expenses.", "23 The Commission took the view in the contested decision that the third type of aid in question, the grant of PTE 1 912 335 000 (that is, 15% of the eligible investments) by way of co-financing of investments eligible for Community aid in the amount of PTE 6 372 065 000 (that is, 49.97% of the eligible investments) under Regulation No 866/90, did not fall within the scope of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.", "It postponed consideration of the question whether the sugar refinery project met the conditions for Community financing under that regulation.", "24 By letter of 19 March 1996 the Commission informed the three complainants of its decision of 11 January 1996 not to raise any objection under Article 92 of the Treaty with regard to the aid granted to DAI.", "Proceedings before the Court of First Instance and the judgment under appeal", "25 By application received at the Registry of the Court of First Instance on 29 May 1996, the applicants brought an action under Article 173 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 230 EC), for annulment of the contested decision and the letter of 19 March 1996.", "The Portuguese Republic and DAI intervened in support of the forms of order sought by the Commission.", "That action was dismissed by the judgment under appeal.", "26 The Court of First Instance considered, as a preliminary point, the pleas of inadmissibility raised by the Commission, supported by the Portuguese Republic and DAI, against the application for annulment.", "27 First, it dismissed the application for annulment of the letter of 19 March 1996 as inadmissible.", "It held, at paragraphs 29 and 30 of the judgment under appeal, that the letter was purely informative and was not therefore an act open to challenge under Article 173 of the Treaty.", "28 Next, at paragraphs 35 to 37 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance considered the Commission's first objection of inadmissibility, inasmuch as the contested decision concerned aid granted in the form of tax reliefs.", "The Commission contended that those reliefs were covered by the decision of 3 July 1991 and that it had therefore confined itself to recording, in the contested decision, that those reliefs constituted existing aid.", "In its view, the annulment of the contested decision could in no way call such aid into question, so that the applicants had no interest in bringing proceedings.", "The Court of First Instance rejected that plea of inadmissibility.", "It held that it had first of all to examine whether those measures were compatible with the common agricultural policy in order to assess whether they were actually covered by the decision of 3 July 1991 and then to consider whether that decision was lawful.", "It stated that, if it were to annul the contested decision because of the incompatibility of those reliefs with the rules of the common agricultural policy or because the decision of 3 July 1991 was unlawful, that annulment would have the effect of calling into question the aid paid to DAI, which demonstrated that the applicants had an interest in bringing proceedings.", "In that regard, it held that the separate question of the admissibility of the plea that the decision of 3 July 1991 was illegal could only be examined later in connection with the assessment of the substance of the claim for annulment.", "29 Finally, at paragraphs 38 to 40 of the judgment under appeal, it rejected the second objection of inadmissibility in which it was contended that the applicants were not directly and individually concerned by the contested decision within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of Article 173 of the Treaty.", "It held that the applicants could secure compliance with the procedural guarantees afforded them by Article 92(2) of the Treaty as interested third parties, if the Commission decided not to open the procedure under that provision, only if they had the opportunity to challenge that decision before the Court of First Instance.", "Moreover, the Court held, only the adoption of the contested decision enabled the applicants to appraise the extent to which their interests were affected.", "30 As regards the substance of the contested decision, the Court of First Instance considered in turn the pleas raised by the applicants against the three categories of aid granted to DAI, that is to say, tax reliefs, aid for vocational training and investment aid under Regulation No 866/90.", "31 The first plea raised by the applicants as regards the tax reliefs was that the decision of 3 July 1991 was illegal.", "32 As regards the objection of inadmissibility raised against that plea on the basis that the applicants should have brought an action against those measures before the national court, relying on Article 184 of the EC Treaty (now Article 241 EC) in order to prevent implementation of the decision, the Court of First Instance held, at paragraphs 46 to 50 of the judgment under appeal, that that objection could not be upheld.", "It held that effective judicial protection of the applicants' rights was assured only if they had an opportunity to raise an objection alleging the irregularity of the decision of 3 July 1991 in proceedings challenging the Commission decision relating to individual aid, which alone allowed them to determine precisely the extent to which their individual interests are affected.", "33 In paragraphs 55 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance rejected the first part of the first plea, alleging failure to examine the sectoral consequences of the general scheme of tax reliefs.", "It held that the applicants had not demonstrated that compliance with the rules applicable to the sugar sector was not ensured by the conditions laid down in the decision of 3 July 1991.", "Further, it pointed out that the aid granted in the sugar sector under the general scheme of tax reliefs did not escape Commission control since the Commission could at any time verify the compatibility of such individual aid with that decision and in particular with the rules applicable to the agricultural sector concerned.", "34 The second part of the first plea, alleging a lack of transparency in the procedure for approval of the decision of 3 July 1991, was rejected by the Court of First Instance at paragraphs 61 to 63 of the judgment under appeal.", "The Court of First Instance held that the lack of any publicity concerning notification and examination of a grant of aid under Article 93(3) of the Treaty cannot be assimilated to a lack of transparency.", "While the Court recognised that the examination of State aid forming part of the preliminary stage did not enable the Commission to take account of the interests of third parties, it pointed out that the procedure incorporated sufficient guarantees and was therefore fully justified by the need to avoid delay where it was clear that the measure notified by the Member State concerned or complained about by a third party did not constitute State aid or constituted State aid compatible with the common market.", "35 The Court of First Instance also rejected, at paragraphs 66 to 68 of the judgment under appeal, the third part of the first plea, concerning the alleged impropriety of the internal procedure for the adoption of the decision of 3 July 1991, since the applicants had not, in its view, produced any significant evidence capable of raising serious doubts as to the legality of that procedure.", "36 At paragraphs 72 to 75 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance rejected the second plea raised by the applicants, alleging that the Commission should have assessed the tax reliefs in the light of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.", "It recalled that the Court of Justice had held, in Case C-47/91 Italy v Commission [1994] ECR I-4635, that once a general aid scheme has been approved by the Commission, the individual implementing measures do not need to be notified to it unless reservations to that effect were expressed in the approval decision.", "It stated that direct examination of each individual aid would, in that case, be contrary to the principles of protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty.", "The Court of First Instance also held that an individual aid granted in implementation of a general aid scheme could not in principle be regarded as an unforeseeable application of that scheme.", "The Court of First Instance also observed that, in the present case, the tax reliefs did not exceed 10% of the investment made and were compatible with the Community law applicable in the sector concerned.", "According to the Court of First Instance, they therefore complied with the conditions laid down by the decision of 3 July 1991 and did not thus need to be notified to the Commission, so that it would not have been entitled to examine them in the light of Article 92 of the EC Treaty.", "37 The third plea relating to the tax reliefs, alleging that they were incompatible with the common agricultural policy, was rejected by the Court of First Instance at paragraphs 84 to 94 of the judgment under appeal.", "The Court of First Instance first recalled that the Commission had to examine the propriety of the tax reliefs granted to DAI having regard only to the conditions it imposed in the decision of 3 July 1991 and, in particular, to the rules applicable to the sugar sector.", "It went on to point out that those tax reliefs, which were intended to facilitate the development of certain economic regions in accordance with Article 92(3)(c) of the Treaty, were compatible with the aims pursued by both Regulation No 1785/81 and by the Community's structural measures in the agricultural sector.", "The Court of First Instance concluded that the applicants' arguments concerning aggravation of the overproduction of sugar in the Community and an increase in the charges borne by the Guidance Section of the EAGGF, were not such as to call into question the aid for the setting up of a beet sugar refinery in Portugal.", "Finally, it noted that the file contained no persuasive evidence casting doubt on the viability of the beet sugar refinery which benefited from the measures in question.", "38 At paragraphs 98 to 101 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance rejected the sole plea raised by the applicants relating to the aid for vocational training of infringement of Article 92(3)(c) of the EC Treaty.", "The Court of First Instance held, first, that each of the three types of aid granted to DAI had to be examined individually in the light of the legal rules applicable to it.", "It went on to point out that, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice (Case C-225/91 Matra v Commission [1993] ECR I-3203, paragraphs 24 and 25), in its review of the legality of a decision taken under Article 92(3)(c) of the Treaty, the Community Court must restrict itself to determining whether the Commission has exceeded the scope of its discretion by a manifest error of assessment or by misuse of powers.", "The Court of First Instance held, finally, that the applicants had put forward no argument sufficient to call into question the notion that the vocational training aid at issue would contribute to the development of certain economic activities without adversely affecting trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.", "39 The applicants put forward two pleas in law in support of the claim for annulment of the contested decision in so far as it relates to investment aid under Regulation No 866/90.", "First, they submitted that grants of State aid fulfilling the conditions laid down by that regulation to qualify for Community co-financing were nevertheless subject to the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.", "Second, they claimed that Regulation No 866/90 excluded investment aid at issue.", "40 At paragraphs 111 to 120 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance rejected the first of those pleas, which it held to be based on Article 44 of Regulation No 1785/81, which provides, on the basis of Article 42 of the Treaty, that Article 92 of the Treaty inter alia applies to production of and trade in agricultural products only to the extent determined by the Council.", "The Court of First Instance noted, first of all, that actions of a structural nature conducted under the auspices of the Guidance Section of the EAGGF did not fall within the scope of Regulation No 1785/81 but within that of Regulation No 866/90, a regulation based on Article 42 of the Treaty and Article 43 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 37 EC).", "It inferred from the absence of any provision in Regulation No 866/90 expressly providing for the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty and Article 94 of the EC Treaty (now Article 89 EC) to aid eligible for Community co-financing under the Guidance Section of the EAGGF, that such aid had to be assessed in the specific context of the common action undertaken in accordance with that regulation and could not be the subject of examination under Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.", "41 The Court of First Instance went on to point out that, even if Article 44 of Regulation No 1785/81 could be interpreted as specifically providing for the application of Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty to every aid measure concerning sugar production and marketing, it had to be applied having regard to the aims of the common agricultural policy, whose precedence over the application of the Treaty provisions relating to competition is enshrined in the Treaty itself, in Article 42.", "According to the Court, the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty to aid eligible for Community co-financing in the context of Regulation No 866/90 would be liable to frustrate the pursuit of certain aims of the common agricultural policy by means of specific structural action undertaken in conformity with the criteria laid down in Decision 94/173.", "The Court held that Regulation No 866/90 itself ensured the consistency of investment aid, co-financed by the Community and the Member State concerned pursuant to that regulation, with the common agricultural policy.", "It thus concluded that the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty to investment aid eligible for Community co-financing under Regulation No 866/90 would be incompatible with the precedence over the rules on competition accorded by the Treaty to the common agricultural policy.", "42 Finally, at paragraph 124 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance rejected the applicants' second plea, according to which the investment aid was excluded by Regulation No 866/90 because it was incompatible with the common agricultural policy and could not be based on Decision 94/173, which was itself incompatible with that policy.", "The Court held, referring to paragraphs 89 and 90 of its judgment, that aid granted with a view to utilising the quota allocated to mainland Portugal was not incompatible with the aims of the common agricultural policy.", "Forms of order sought", "43 The appellants claim that the Court should:", "- declare their appeal admissible;", "- set aside the judgment under appeal to the extent required by that appeal;", "- annul the contested decision or refer the case back to the Court of First Instance in accordance with Article 54 of the EC Statute of the Court of Justice;", "- order the Commission to pay the costs of both sets of proceedings.", "44 The Commission contends that the Court should:", "- set aside paragraphs 35 to 95 of the judgment under appeal and declare the application inadmissible in so far as it was directed against the part of the contested decision relating to the tax reliefs; or, in the alternative,", "- set aside paragraphs 35 to 41 and 46 to 50 of the judgment under appeal but confirm the remainder of the judgment or, in the further alternative,", "- set aside the words in their view contained in paragraph 36 of the judgment under appeal and such other parts of the judgment the Court considers appropriate, and decide on the pleas of admissibility raised by the Commission but dismissed by the Court of First Instance;", "and", "- dismiss the appeal as manifestly inadmissible and/or unfounded without opening the oral procedure and order the appellants to bear the costs;", "or", "- dismiss the appeal and order the appellants to bear the costs.", "45 The Portuguese Republic contends that the Court should:", "- uphold the judgment under appeal;", "- dismiss the appeal against that judgment in its entirety.", "46 DAI contends that the Court should:", "- dismiss the appeal as inadmissible with respect to the first and second limbs of the first plea, the second and third limbs of the second plea, the fourth plea and the sixth plea;", "- dismiss the remainder of the appeal as unfounded; and", "- order the appellants to pay the costs of both sets of proceedings,", "or", "- dismiss the appeal in its entirety as unfounded; and", "- order the appellants to pay the costs of both sets of proceedings.", "Admissibility of the main appeal", "47 The Commission and DAI seek a declaration by the Court that the main appeal is clearly inadmissible since it does no more than repeat or reproduce verbatim the pleas in law relied on before the Court of First Instance and contains no specific legal argument for having the judgment under appeal set aside.", "48 According to settled case-law, where an appeal merely repeats or reproduces verbatim the pleas in law and arguments previously submitted to the Court of First Instance, including those based on facts expressly rejected by that Court, it fails to satisfy the requirements under Article 51 of the EC Statute of the Court of Justice and Article 112(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure.", "In reality, such an appeal amounts to no more than a request for re-examination of the application submitted to the Court of First Instance, which, under Article 49 of the EC Statute of the Court of Justice, falls outside the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice (see, in particular, the order of 25 March 1998 in Case C-174/97 P FFSA and Others v Commission [1998] ECR I-1303, paragraph 24).", "49 However, provided that the appellant challenges the interpretation or application of Community law by the Court of First Instance, the points of law examined at first instance may be discussed again in the course of an appeal (Case C-210/98 P Salzgitter v Commission [2000] ECR I-5843, paragraph 43).", "Indeed, if an appellant could not thus base his appeal on pleas in law and arguments already relied on before the Court of First Instance, an appeal would be deprived of part of its purpose.", "50 In the present case the main appeal, taken as a whole, specifically seeks to challenge the position adopted by the Court of First Instance on various points of law raised before it at first instance.", "It indicates clearly the aspects of the judgment under appeal which are criticised and the pleas in law and arguments on which it is based.", "51 The claim that the Court should dismiss the appeal as manifestly inadmissible in its entirety must therefore be rejected.", "The Commission's cross-appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "52 The Commission contends that the action before the Court of First Instance, to the extent that it was directed against the part of the contested decision relating to tax reliefs, was inadmissible.", "The Court was wrong to hold, at paragraphs 35 to 37 of the judgment under appeal, that a letter from the Commission containing information that an individual aid is covered by a general aid scheme already approved by the Commission always constitutes an act susceptible to judicial review under Article 173 of the Treaty.", "The Commission contends that at first instance the appellants had no legal interest in seeking annulment of the contested measure because annulment would not affect their legal position in any way.", "That measure merely recorded that the tax reliefs at issue constituted existing aid covered by an approved general scheme.", "It thus had no legal effects and could not, therefore, be regarded as constituting a decision.", "The Commission puts forward the following arguments in support of its contentions.", "53 As a preliminary point, the Commission contends that the statements by the Court of First Instance at paragraphs 35 and 36 of the judgment under appeal that, on the one hand, the objection of inadmissibility raised by the Commission could not be upheld and, on the other hand, the question of inadmissibility could not be examined at that stage of the judgment, contradict one another.", "That internal contradiction is incompatible with the obligation to state reasons under Article 190 of the EC Treaty (now Article 253 EC).", "54 The Commission's other arguments develop its central assertion that the contested measure is not in the nature of a decision as regards the appellants as third parties, but rather a statement of facts.", "The reasoning followed by the Court of First Instance, which makes the question of the admissibility of the action conditional on examination of its merits, allows complainants to call into question, by means of a challenge to an individual aid, the validity of a Commission decision approving a general aid scheme, a decision which is, after all, by then definitive.", "This prejudices the interests of the beneficiaries of the aid and of the Member States concerned, in breach of the principles of legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations, as was acknowledged in Italy v Commission, cited above, and Case C-188/92 TWD Textilwerke Deggendorf [1994] ECR I-833.", "Complainants are thereby given a further means of redress, whereas their objections in connection with aid such as that at issue should be made before the national court, it being for that court to refer, if it considers it necessary, a question to the Court of Justice on the validity of the decision approving the general aid scheme.", "55 In the alternative, the Commission requests the Court to set aside paragraph 36 of the judgment under appeal in so far as, in the English version, English being the language of the case, it relies on the words in their view.", "The Commission contends that it constitutes an error in law to base the admissibility of an action for annulment before the Court of First Instance on the subjective view of the applicant.", "56 The appellants submit, as regards the alleged contradiction between paragraphs 35 and 36 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission has not established an error of law.", "In any event, such a contradiction could not lead to that judgment's being set aside.", "57 As regards the other arguments of the Commission, the appellants submit that the grounds of the judgment under appeal must be upheld.", "They take the view that the question of the admissibility of the action for annulment does indeed depend on the question whether the tax reliefs granted under Decree-Law No 95/90 fall within the scope of the decision of 3 July 1991.", "They argue that the decision by which the Commission deemed an individual aid measure to be covered by a general aid scheme which had already been approved does affect their interests directly and cannot therefore be defined as a statement of facts.", "Judicial protection of the appellants under the rules relating to State aid entails that their action be held admissible, as it represents the only legal means of examining the legality of the decision of 3 July 1991 and of assessing whether the individual aid measure at issue complied with the general scheme.", "58 As regards the Commission's argument that the Court should set aside the words in their view in paragraph 36 of the English version of the judgment under appeal, the appellants submit that the Court of First Instance did not base the admissibility of the action on a subjective analysis of their interests.", "It merely held that they had an interest in seeking the annulment of the contested decision, basing their action on the fact that the tax reliefs were not, in their view, covered by the decision of 3 July 1991.", "The Court of First Instance considered the merits of that view at paragraphs 44 to 50 of the judgment under appeal.", "Findings of the Court", "59 First, it is clear from reading paragraphs 35 and 36 of the judgment under appeal that they are not vitiated by any contradiction, contrary to the contention of the Commission.", "To begin with, in paragraph 35, the Court of First Instance rejected the objection of inadmissibility raised by the Commission.", "In paragraph 36 it set out the reasons why it considered that the objection could not be upheld.", "Whilst, at the end of paragraph 36, it deferred consideration of one question of admissibility, that question concerned the more specific allegation by the Commission that the objection that the decision of 3 July 1991 was illegal was itself inadmissible.", "The Court of First Instance analysed that separate question at paragraphs 44 to 50 of the judgment under appeal.", "The argument alleging a contradiction in the grounds thus cannot be upheld.", "60 Second, as regards the appellants' interest in bringing proceedings against the part of the contested decision relating to tax reliefs, it is clear from the case-law of the Court of Justice, as the Commission points out, that individual grants of aid under a general aid scheme approved by the Commission which meet the conditions of that scheme constitute existing aid which does not need to be notified  (Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraphs 21 to 26).", "Since it is not notified before it is implemented, such aid does not require an express decision by the Commission and its legality can only be assessed by the national courts (TWD Textilwerke Deggendorf, cited above, paragraphs 15 to 18).", "61 However, the background to the present dispute is not the same.", "It is clear from the documents on the Court file that the individual tax reliefs at issue were examined by the Commission, which had received complaints about them from the appellants.", "The Commission took the view that those measures did comply with the two conditions laid down by the decision of 3 July 1991 for them to be classified as existing aid, exempt as such from formal notification and from examination of their compatibility with Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.", "In taking that position, the Commission did not confine itself to recording that the individual measures at issue were in the nature of existing aid.", "Taking the view that those measures were covered by the decision of 3 July 1991, it also decided not to open the procedure provided for by Article 93(2) of the Treaty.", "The appellants, who could have intervened as complainants in such a procedure if the Commission had opened it, would be deprived of that guarantee if they did not have the option of challenging before the Court of First Instance the assessment made by the Commission (see, to that effect, Case C-198/91 Cook v Commission [1993] ECR I-2487, paragraphs 20 to 24).", "62 Accordingly, in holding, at paragraph 36 of the judgment under appeal, that the fact that the aid at issue was existing aid did not deprive the applicants of an interest in bringing proceedings in that case, on the ground that such aid might not be covered by the decision of 3 July 1991, and, at paragraphs 39 and 40 of that judgment, that the applicants could secure compliance with the procedural guarantees under Article 93(2) of the Treaty only if they were able to challenge the contested decision before the Community Court, the Court of First Instance did not err in law.", "63 As regards, thirdly, the Commission's claim in the alternative that the Court should set aside the words in their view in paragraph 36 of the English version of the judgment under appeal, it is clear from the grounds of that judgment that the Court of First Instance did not decide on the admissibility of the application on the basis of a subjective appraisal of the interests of the applicants, but, as explained above, on the basis of the rules governing the admissibility of actions under Article 173 of the Treaty.", "Against that background, the Commission's claim, even if it is admissible, is not well founded.", "64 It follows from the foregoing that the Commission's cross-appeal must be dismissed.", "The merits of the main appeal", "The first plea, concerning the objection that the decision of 3 July 1991 was illegal.", "Arguments of the parties", "65 By their first plea the appellants allege that the Court of First Instance erred in law in holding, at paragraphs 55 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, that the decision of 3 July 1991, by which the Commission approved the general scheme of tax reliefs laid down by Decree-Law No 95/90, ensured compliance with the rules applicable to the sugar sector.", "They submit that that conclusion is based on two erroneous findings.", "66 First, in the decision of 3 July 1991, the Commission made the grant of individual aid under Decree-Law No 95/90 conditional on compliance with the rules and guidelines laid down by Community law in relation to certain industrial, agricultural and fisheries sectors.", "However, contrary to what the Court of First Instance held, such a condition is inadequate and too imprecise to be regarded as an appropriate condition to safeguard the interests of the common agricultural policy in a sensitive sector such as sugar.", "67 Second, the Court of First Instance was wrong to infer from Article 93 of the Treaty that the Commission can at any time verify the compatibility of individual aid granted to the sugar sector with the rules applicable to the agricultural sector concerned.", "In that connection, the appellants submit that the Commission's powers under Article 93(1) of the Treaty, which do not allow it to suspend the payment of aid, cannot be regarded as an appropriate alternative to the procedure provided for by Article 93(3) and (2) of the Treaty, where a general aid scheme is applied.", "Moreover, the position of third parties is substantially weaker in the case of constant review under Article 93(1) of the Treaty than it is in the case of the application of Article 93(2) and (3) of the Treaty.", "68 The Commission contends that this plea, which merely repeats the arguments relied on at first instance, is not admissible.", "As to the merits, it agrees with the analysis set out at paragraphs 55 to 57 of the judgment under appeal and contends that, when it approves a general aid scheme, it must, as it did in the present case, take the necessary steps to ensure that the relevant special sectoral rules that it has adopted are also taken into consideration.", "69 The Portuguese Government submits that the Court of First Instance's view is, for the most part, based on the idea that approval of a general aid scheme does not entail any derogations from the rules applicable to each sector.", "Since approval by the Commission of such schemes is legally possible, the reasoning it followed in its decision of 3 July 1991, which was upheld by the Court of First Instance, is the best guarantee of compliance with all the rules which may be relevant at the time of implementation of the general aid scheme.", "The Portuguese Government dismisses, moreover, the appellants' suggestion that the approval of such a scheme must be accompanied by a statement of the applicable sectoral conditions.", "Such a solution entails practical and legal disadvantages, since the alleged need to set out the sectoral conditions would detract from the clarity of the scheme.", "The Portuguese Government also points out that the Court of First Instance took account, at paragraph 56 of the judgment under appeal, of compliance with sectoral rules and the protection of the interests of third parties, where it stressed that the Commission could at any time verify the compatibility of aids.", "70 DAI contends, for the same reasons as the Commission, that the first plea is inadmissible.", "As to the merits, it contends that the protection of the interests of third parties is not weaker under Article 93(1) of the Treaty than under Article 93(3) thereof.", "Findings of the Court", "71 As regards the admissibility of this plea, the same response must be given to the Commission and DAI as was given at paragraphs 48 to 51 of this judgment to the objection of inadmissibility raised against the main appeal as a whole, that is to say, the objection must be rejected.", "72 As regards the merits, it is settled case-law that the Commission may approve general aid schemes in the course of the review it must carry out under Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty and dispense with notification by Member States of individual aid measures taken under such schemes, subject to the reservations it may express in the decision allowing such schemes (Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraph 21, and Case C-278/95 P Siemens v Commission [1997] ECR I-2507, paragraphs 31 to 33).", "The Commission has a wide discretion in this matter (Case C-169/95 Spain v Commission [1997] ECR I-135, paragraph 18).", "73 Second, it is for the Commission, when it approves a general aid scheme, to take the necessary measures to ensure that the sectoral rules other than the general competition rules will be complied with by the Member State concerned.", "74 In the event, the Commission made the approval under its decision of 3 July 1991 subject to the express condition that the individual aid was in conformity with the rules and guidelines laid down by Community law in relation to certain industrial, agricultural and fisheries sectors.", "It also required the Portuguese Government to notify all projects enjoying reliefs of between 10 and 20% (ESL) and all those in sensitive sectors.", "75 The appellants have not put forward any more arguments than they did at first instance capable of establishing that those instructions were in breach of the rules applicable to the sugar sector or were insufficient to the extent that the decision of 3 July 1991 was vitiated by illegality.", "76 Moreover, it is common ground that the Commission is not prevented, after the adoption of a decision approving a general aid scheme, from examining the compatibility of an individual aid measure with that decision.", "Such an examination can be carried out at any time under Article 93(1) of the Treaty, particularly in the event of any complaints which the Commission may receive.The decision of 3 July 1991 thus does not have the effect of preventing the legitimate interests of third parties from being taken into account and cannot, therefore, be regarded as an illegal restriction of the scope of Article 93(2) and (3) of the Treaty.", "77 Accordingly, since the conditions laid down by the Commission in the decision of 3 July 1991 were not inadequate and that decision did not prejudice the protection of the legitimate interests of the appellants, the Court of First Instance did not err in law.", "The first plea must, therefore, be rejected.", "The second plea, alleging that the tax reliefs should have been notified to the Commission", "Arguments of the parties", "78 The appellants submit that the Court of First Instance erred in law in holding, at paragraphs 72 to 75 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was not entitled to examine the compatibility of the tax reliefs granted to DAI with Article 92 of the Treaty.", "They argue that the reliefs did not constitute the foreseeable implementation, purely and simply, of the general aid scheme approved by the Commission.", "In a sensitive sector like sugar, characterised by large production surpluses, the Portuguese Government should have notified such measures to the Commission which should then have examined their compatibility directly in relation to Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty, taking into account requirements which it was not able to assess when the general scheme was approved.", "The Court of First Instance thus applied the judgment in Italy v Commission, cited above, incorrectly.", "79 The Commission considers that the second plea is manifestly inadmissible, like the first plea and for the same reasons.", "As to the substance, it points out that it is under an obligation to apply the relevant rules of the Treaty, as it did in the present case, in such a way as to take the objectives of regional and sectoral policy into account.", "Moreover, contrary to what the appellants allege, it is clear from the Italy v Commission judgment that, having approved a general aid scheme, the Commission cannot open the procedure under Article 93(2) of the Treaty in relation to an individual aid granted under such a scheme, without first ascertaining whether that aid met the terms of the approved scheme.", "80 The Portuguese Government submits that the Commission did not fail to analyse the sectoral compatibility of the tax relief scheme at issue.", "That aid was approved in accordance with Article 16(5) of Regulation No 866/90, which provides that Member States may take aid measures where the amount of aid exceeds that laid down for common measures in the context of the EAGGF, Guidance Section.", "81 DAI submits that the second plea of the appeal is inadmissible in so far as it merely repeats the arguments put forward before the Court of First Instance and challenges a finding of pure fact regarding the foreseeability of the application of Decree-Law No 95/90 to the aid in question.", "In the alternative, DAI submits that there was no need to notify the aid as there was no provision in the decision of 3 July 1991 which required the Portuguese Republic to do so.", "Findings of the Court", "82 First, the second plea of the appeal sets out clearly the aspects of the judgment under appeal which are challenged and gives an account of the legal arguments in support of it.", "In addition, this claim relates to the infringement of Community law the Court of First Instance is alleged to have committed in holding that the Commission did not have to examine the compatibility of an individual aid measure with Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty and does not, therefore, constitute a challenge to a finding of fact, which, in an appeal, is outside the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice.", "Accordingly, this plea is admissible.", "83 Second, when the Commission has before it a specific grant of aid alleged to have been made in pursuance of a previously authorised scheme, it cannot at the outset examine it directly in relation to the Treaty.", "Prior to the initiation of any procedure, it must first examine whether the aid is covered by the general scheme and satisfies the conditions laid down in the decision approving it.", "If it did not do so, the Commission could, whenever it examined an individual aid measure, go back on its decision approving the aid scheme, which had already involved an examination in the light of Article 92 of the Treaty.", "This would jeopardise the principles of the protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty (Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraph 24).", "Aid which constitutes the strict and foreseeable application of the conditions laid down in the decision approving the general aid scheme is thus considered to be existing aid (Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraph 25), which does not need to be notified to the Commission or examined in the light of Article 92 of the Treaty.", "84 In the present dispute, as pointed out at paragraph 20 of this judgment, the decision of 3 July 1991, approving the aid scheme set up by Decree-Law No 95/90, made authorisation for tax reliefs subject to two conditions, compliance with which the Commission, in the contested decision, verified before confirming that they had been fulfilled.", "85 In that regard, the condition relating to the rules applicable in the agricultural sector concerned was not made subject, in the decision of 3 July 1991, to an obligation of prior notification of the planned aid.", "Rather, in that decision, the Commission required those rules to be respected in practice when individual grants of aid were made.", "It is clear from the terms of the contested decision that the Commission took the view that the project for the construction of a beet sugar refinery in Portugal, eligible for Community financing under the EAGGF, was therefore compatible with the objectives of the common agricultural policy.", "86 It follows from the foregoing that, in holding, at paragraphs 72 to 75 of the judgment under appeal, that the tax reliefs granted to DAI did not need to be notified and that the Commission was not entitled to examine them directly in relation to Article 92 of the Treaty, the Court of First Instance did not err in its application of Community law.", "The second plea must, therefore, be rejected.", "The third plea alleging that the tax reliefs are incompatible with the aims of the common agricultural policy", "Arguments of the parties", "87 The appellants allege that Court of First Instance erred in law in holding, at paragraphs 84 to 94 of the judgment under appeal, that the application of Decree-Law No 95/90 to the sugar industry was not incompatible with the aims of the common agricultural policy.", "They rely on three arguments in support of that plea.", "88 First, they submit that the refinery project at issue was not exempt from the Treaty provisions relating to State aid or from those concerning the common organisation of the market in sugar.", "Unlike Article 141 of the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the European Union is founded (OJ 1994 C 241, p. 21, and OJ 1995 L 1, p. 1), the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic does not contain any provision authorising exceptional measures of State aid.", "In the absence of such exceptional authorisation in that Act, it must be assumed that the rule prohibiting aid for the processing of sugarbeet in Regulation No 1785/81 applies to the investment project at issue.", "89 Next, the appellants claim that the Court of First Instance erred in holding, at paragraphs 89 and 90 of the judgment under appeal, that the grant of a sugar quota to the Portuguese Republic entitled the Portuguese Government to grant State aid for the construction of a sugar refinery in mainland Portugal, aid which, in their view, creates an entirely artificial sugar producer and distorts competition by aggravating overproduction on the common market in sugar.", "90 Finally, contrary to what the Court of First Instance held at paragraph 90 of the judgment under appeal, neither Regulation No 866/90 nor Decision 94/173 support the conclusion that the aid concerned is compatible with the common market organisation for sugar.", "The appellants assert that Decision 94/173 unlawfully made investment in the Portuguese beet sugar industry eligible for Community co-financing and that, in that decision, the Commission mistakenly considered it to be eligible simply because Portugal had been granted a sugar quota.", "They point out that this error was perpetuated in the Community guidelines for State aid in connection with investments in the processing and marketing of agricultural products.", "91 The Commission contends that this third plea is inadmissible for the same reasons as the first two pleas are.", "As to the substance, it submits that the provisions relating to the accession of Member States other than the Portuguese Republic are not at all relevant in this case and that the legal basis for the aid at issue is the decision of 3 July 1991.", "It argues that the appellants fail to take account of the fact that Regulation No 866/90 and Decision 94/173 are an integral part of the common agricultural policy.", "Regulation No 1785/81 should be interpreted in conjunction with those texts, which provide expressly for an exception to the rule of prohibition of State aid in the sugar sector in respect of the Portuguese quota.", "Moreover, the contested aid was, according to the Commission, authorised also as regional aid, an area in which the Commission has a wide discretion in determining what is compatible with the common market.", "92 The Portuguese Government points out that Article 16(5) of Regulation No 866/90 allows Member States to take aid measures in addition to Community action.", "Moreover, Article 25 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92 of 15 June 1992 concerning specific measures for the Azores and Madeira relating to certain agricultural products (OJ 1992 L 173, p. 1), provides for aid to be granted for the development of sugar beet production and the processing of sugar beet harvested in the Azores into white sugar, up to the limit of a total annual production of 10 000 tonnes of refined sugar, which shows that, at Community level, aid measures in the sugar sector are not regarded with total disfavour.", "The Portuguese Government then points out that the sugar quota granted to the Portuguese Republic was contained in an instrument of the highest rank, namely, the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic.", "93 DAI submits that aid to promote utilisation of the sugar quota allocated to the Portuguese Republic by the Act of Accession cannot be construed as contrary to the aims of the common agricultural policy.", "It adds that the Court of First Instance did not hold that the legality of the aid granted to DAI follows automatically from the fact that Portugal was granted a sugar quota in that Act of Accession.", "On the contrary, it is clear from the Court's reasoning that the legal basis for the grant of such aid is to be found in the relevant provisions of Regulation No 866/90 and Decision 94/173.", "Findings of the Court", "94 First, by their third plea, supported by detailed arguments, the appellants set out clearly their challenge to the grounds of the judgment under appeal.", "This plea is therefore admissible.", "95 Second, the tax reliefs granted to DAI must, as the decision of 3 July 1991 provides, comply with the rules of the common agricultural policy in the sugar sector laid down by Regulation No 1785/81.", "96 Article 44 of that regulation provides that Articles 92, 93 and 94 of the Treaty are to apply to the production of, and trade in, sugar.", "That article also provides that that general rule is to be applicable save as otherwise provided in this Regulation.", "Article 45 thereof provides that it is to be applied so that appropriate account is taken, at the same time, of the objectives set out in Articles 39 of the EC Treaty (now Article 33 EC).", "Moreover, as the Court of First Instance pointed out at paragraph 89 of the judgment under appeal, Article 24 of that regulation was specifically amended by the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic so as to allow to that Member State, on its mainland, the benefit of a production quota of 60 000 tonnes for sugar.", "97 It is clear from those provisions that, while it does not, per se, authorise the payment of State aid to a project intended to utilise that quota, Regulation No 1785/81 in no way precludes that possibility.", "98 At paragraph 89 of the judgment under appeal the Court of First Instance made the same preliminary finding and thus did not consider that the tax reliefs in favour of DAI could be declared compatible with the common agricultural policy solely because of the allocation of that quota.", "Accordingly, the argument that, unlike the Act of Accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden, the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic did not contain a clause providing for the exceptional grant of State aid is, in any event, redundant.", "99 Article 45 of Regulation No 1785/81 refers to the general objectives of the common agricultural policy set out in Article 39 of the Treaty, which include, in Article 39(2)(a), taking account of the particular nature of agricultural activity, which results from the social structure of agriculture and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions.", "The rules applicable to investment in the sugar sector are thus not only those established by Regulation No 1785/81.", "They also appear in the legislative texts governing the structural and regional policy measures of the Community.", "100 Those texts make provision for the Community, or the Portuguese Republic, to grant financial support for the investment project at issue.", "101 First of all, Article 16(5) of Regulation No 866/90, a regulation adopted on the basis of Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty and thus an integral part of the common agricultural policy, makes provision for Member States to grant, over and above the measures specifically provided for by that regulation, aid for the processing and marketing of agricultural products, under the conditions laid down by Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty.", "102 Next, the aid granted to DAI meets the criteria for eligibility of investment liable to benefit from financial aid under the Guidance Section of the EAGGF laid down by Decision 94/173.", "That decision provides, at point 2.8 of its annex, that, by way of exception to the rule which excludes investment in the sugar sector, investment for the purpose of the utilisation of the quota provided for in the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic may be given Community financing.", "103 By the contested decision, the Commission indicated that in the sector of the processing and marketing of agricultural products, State aid must meet the criteria for selection of investments set by Decision 94/173.", "That guideline is the same as that in the Commission communications relating to State aid in that sector such as those of 12 July 1994 and 23 March 1995 and the communication of 2 February 1996, issued after the events which are the subject of this dispute.", "104 Next, in taking the view that the objectives of the regional and agricultural policy of the Community justified the particular treatment of the investment project at issue, as regards a region covered by Objective No 1, the Commission did not exercise its discretion in a manifestly erroneous way.", "Nor did it disregard the terms of the authority conferred on it by Article 8 of Regulation No 866/90 to fix criteria for the eligibility of investments for Community action.", "105 Finally, it must be pointed out that the fact that the investment made by DAI is specifically taken into account is a result precisely of the special treatment given to the Portuguese Republic by the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic, as the Court of First Instance observed at paragraph 89 of the judgment under appeal.", "106 Accordingly, the appellants' argument that the contested decision creates an artificial sugar producer and distorts competition by aggravating overproduction on the common market in sugar must be rejected.", "107 It follows from the foregoing that, in holding that the tax reliefs granted to DAI were not incompatible with the aims of the common agricultural policy, the Court of First Instance did not err in law.", "Accordingly, the third plea can only be rejected.", "The fourth plea relating to the error in law made by the Court of First Instance in refusing to assess the effect of the contested aid measures taken together.", "Arguments of the parties", "108 By their fourth plea the appellants complain that the Court of First Instance did not take account, at paragraphs 98 to 101 of the judgment under appeal, of the effect of the various contested aid measures taken together.", "Those measures altogether represent more than 60% of the investment made by DAI and allow it to produce a surplus corresponding to 20 to 25% of national consumption, with guaranteed prices and a cost of less than 40% of fixed costs which can be written off over a very long period.", "DAI was thus placed in an extremely advantageous position.", "109The Commission contends that this plea is clearly inadmissible.", "As to the substance, it argues that the plea cannot succeed as it has a wide discretion in this matter and no manifest error can be established.", "Findings of the Court", "110 While the applicants argued before the Court of First Instance that the Commission had made an error of law in considering in isolation the effects on the common market of the aid for vocational training granted to DAI, it was only in relation to the part of the contested decision relating to that aid.", "They did not thus put forward a general claim for annulment directed at the contested decision as a whole, alleging that the Commission should have assessed the compatibility of the cumulative effect of the three contested measures in the light of Article 92 of the Treaty, as is confirmed by the part of their application entitled General grounds of the action which does not mention that claim.", "111 Thus, the Court of First Instance, at paragraph 98 of the judgment under appeal, pointed to the fact that the three types of aid examined in the contested decision were covered by different sets of legal provisions and had therefore to be examined individually in the light of those rules and the aims which they pursued, only in order to conclude that the compatibility with Article 92 of the Treaty of the aid for vocational training had to be considered separately and that specific plea rejected.", "The plea put forward by the appellants in the appeal is thus wider in scope than that put before the Court of First Instance.", "112 Under Article 118 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, Article 42(2) of those rules, which prohibits generally the introduction of new pleas in law in the course of the procedure, applies to the procedure before the Court of Justice on appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance.", "In an appeal the Court's jurisdiction is thus confined to review of the findings on the pleas argued before the Court of First Instance (see Case C-136/92 P Commission v Brazzelli Lualdi and Others [1994] ECR I-1981, paragraph 59, and the order of 28 June 2001 in Case C-352/99 P Eridania and Others v Council [2001] ECR I-5037, paragraphs 52 and 53).", "113 The plea is, therefore, admissible only to the extent that it criticises the error of law allegedly made by the Court of First Instance in holding that aid for vocational training should be considered separately by the Commission.", "114 As to that, the contested aid measures are covered by different sets of legal provisions.", "As stated at paragraph 86 of this judgment, the tax reliefs could be examined only in the light of the decision of 3 July 1991, which itself refers to the rules of the common agricultural policy, and not directly in the light of Article 92 of the Treaty.", "The national co-financing of the investment considered eligible for the Guidance Section of the EAGGF had to be examined in the light of Regulation No 866/90 and Decision 94/173, which determine the balance to be struck between the aims of the common agricultural policy and of the Community's regional policy in the sugar sector.", "The aid for vocational training was thus the only measure whose compatibility the Commission could assess directly in the light of Article 92 of the Treaty.", "115 Accordingly, the judgment under appeal is not vitiated by any error of law on this point.", "The fourth plea must, therefore, be rejected.", "The fifth plea, alleging that the Court of First Instance erred in law in deciding that Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty did not apply.", "Arguments of the parties", "116 The appellants submit that paragraphs 111 to 120 of the grounds of the judgment under appeal, according to which aid for investment projects eligible for Community co-financing under Regulation No 866/90 cannot be examined under Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty, are vitiated by an error of law.", "They argue that no provision of Regulations No 1785/81 and No 866/90 suggests that those articles are not applicable.", "117 The Commission contends, as a preliminary point, that this plea is clearly inadmissible.", "Then, as regards the substance, it points out that the Council determined, in the light of all the relevant legislation, that the State aid rules apply to aid measures going beyond what is provided for in Regulation No 866/90, but not to measures provided for in that regulation.", "The only material question in this case, it argues, is whether or not the measure is permitted by the common agricultural policy.", "It states that the measure is permitted pursuant to Regulation No 866/90.", "118 The Portuguese Republic and DAI contend that Article 16(5) of Regulation No 866/90, in conjunction with the principle of the precedence of the Common agricultural policy, must be interpreted as precluding the application of the State aid rules to structural measures undertaken under the Guidance Section of the EAGGF.", "Findings of the Court", "119 The fifth plea, like the previous pleas, indicates clearly the contested parts of the judgment and sets out the legal arguments on which it is based.", "It is not therefore the mere repetition of the terms of the action at first instance and must, therefore, be declared admissible.", "120 Second, as regards the merits of the plea, Article 44 of Regulation No 1785/81 merely provides that Articles 92, 93 and 94 of the Treaty are to apply to the production of, and trade in, sugar save as otherwise provided in this Regulation.", "Moreover, that regulation refers, implicitly but necessarily, to the implementation of provisions other than those contained in it, in indicating, in Article 45, that its application must take account of the general objectives of the common agricultural policy set out in Article 39 of the Treaty, one aspect of which is the alleviation of regional disparities in that area.", "121 Regulation No 866/90 sets out the conditions under which the Guidance Section of the EAGGF helps to further the objectives of regional cohesion of the common agricultural policy.", "It lays down as a ground rule, in Article 16(3) and (4), that Member States concerned by investment projects eligible for the Fund, as the Portuguese Republic is by the project at issue, must, like the beneficiaries of the Fund, undertake to participate in financing the investments selected by the Commission for assistance from the EAGGF.", "Co-financing by the Member States, such as that at issue, is thus not only authorised but required by the regulation.", "122 Article 16(5) of Regulation No 866/90, which provides that Member States may take aid measures which are subject to conditions or rules concerning granting which differ from those provided for in that regulation, or, where the amounts of aid exceed the ceilings specified herein, on condition that such measures comply with Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty, thus does not concern the national financial contribution required by Article 16(3) and (4) of that regulation but the aid which the Member States wish to give, over and above their obligatory contribution to the investment projects eligible for the Guidance Section of the EAGGF.", "123 Accordingly, the Court of First Instance did not misapply Community law in holding that the co-financing provided by the Portuguese Republic to the investment project at issue, eligible for the Guidance Section of the EAGGF, had to be assessed in the context of the common action undertaken in accordance with Regulation No 866/90 and could not be the subject of examination under Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.", "124 The fifth plea must, therefore, be rejected.", "The sixth plea, alleging that insufficient grounds were stated for the reply to the last plea in the action before the Court of First Instance", "Arguments of the parties", "125 The appellants submit that insufficient grounds are stated for the rejection, at paragraph 124 of the judgment under appeal, of their plea that the investment aid at issue is incompatible with Regulation No 866/90.", "The Court of First Instance did not take account of the various arguments which they put forward in support of this plea.", "They point out that they argued before the Court of First Instance that the aid concerned did not satisfy the requirements for co-financing laid down by Regulation No 866/90, and that that regulation could not therefore serve as the legal basis for precluding the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.", "126 The Commission considers that this plea is not founded.", "In its view, all the arguments which the applicants put forward in this plea are in fact reiterations of their claim that the aid in question is incompatible with the common agricultural policy, a claim which the Court of First Instance gave sufficient reasons for rejecting.", "127 DAI contends that this ground of appeal is clearly inadmissible because it merely repeats the arguments put before the Court of First Instance without indicating the error of law allegedly made by it.", "Findings of the Court", "128 First, the sixth plea is admissible as it is directed against duly identified grounds of the judgment under appeal and does not merely reproduce the terms of the application to the Court of First Instance.", "129 Second, it is clear from the argument of the appellants that, in this plea, they submit that, in rejecting their claim that the investment aid in question could not fall within the scope of Regulation No 866/90, the Court of First Instance did not rule on their arguments that the aid did not fulfil the basic conditions laid down by Articles 2 and 11 to 13 of that regulation.", "That part of the judgment is thus, it is alleged, vitiated by a failure to state sufficient reasons.", "130 However, it must be borne in mind that, in the contested decision, the Commission took the view that the aid in question fell, on first analysis, within the scope of Regulation No 866/90.", "It concluded from this that the aid could not be examined directly in relation to Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty and stated that it would analyse subsequently, in the light of Regulation (EEC) No 866/90, the aspect of co-financing of the project under that regulation.", "The Commission thus did not consider whether the project fulfilled the conditions for Community co-financing by the Guidance Section of the EAGGF, nor, therefore, whether the national contribution to that project met the basic conditions of the regulation.", "131 The appellants criticised that appraisal before the Court of First Instance, arguing that the investment project in question did not fall within the scope of Regulation No 866/90 and that, therefore, Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty were applicable in the case.", "They put forward two pleas in support of that complaint: the first was that Decision 94/173, adopted pursuant to Regulation No 866/90, was incompatible with the common agricultural policy and, therefore, illegal, while the second was that the basic conditions laid down by that regulation were not, in the event, met.", "132 While, in order to reject the claim that Articles 92 and 93 were applicable to the project at issue, the Court of First Instance was obliged to rule, as it did at paragraphs 89 and 90 of the judgment under appeal, on the plea that Decision 94/173 was incompatible with the common agricultural policy, since that decision determined the scope of Regulation No 866/90, it did not have to rule on the arguments in support of the second plea, relating to the fulfilment of the basic conditions of that regulation, which did not affect the legality of the contested decision and were, therefore, inoperative.", "133 Accordingly, in referring to paragraphs 89 and 90 of the judgment under appeal when rejecting the plea that the aid at issue was not within the scope of Regulation No 866/90, the Court of First Instance did not vitiate the judgment by an insufficient statement of reasons.", "134 The sixth plea must, therefore, be rejected.", "135 It follows from all the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.", "Decision on costs", "Costs", "136 Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, which is applicable to the appeal procedure by virtue of Article 118 of those Rules, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party's pleadings.", "Since the Commission and DAI have applied for costs and the appellants have been unsuccessful, the appellants must be ordered to pay the costs.", "137 The first subparagraph of Article 69(4) of the Rules of Procedure, which also applies to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 118, provides in its first subparagraph that Member States and institutions which intervene in the proceedings are to bear its own costs.", "In accordance with that provision, the Portuguese

procedure,", "after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 30 May 2017,", "gives the following", "Judgment", "1", "By its appeal, the European Commission asks the Court partly to set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 24 September 2015, TV2/Danmark v Commission (T‑674/11, EU:T:2015:684) (‘the judgment under appeal’), whereby the General Court, first, annulled Commission Decision 2011/839/EU of 20 April 2011 on the measures implemented by Denmark (C 2/03) for TV2/Danmark (OJ 2011 L 340, p. 1; ‘the contested decision’), in that the Commission had held that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2/Danmark through the TV2 Fund constituted State aid, and, second, dismissed, for the remainder, the action brought by TV2/Danmark A/S seeking the partial annulment of that decision.", "Background to the dispute", "2", "TV2/Danmark is a Danish broadcasting company which was created in 1986.", "Initially created in the form of an autonomous State undertaking, it was converted, for accounting and tax purposes as of 1 January 2003, into a public limited company.", "TV2/Danmark is the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio.", "3", "The mission of TV2/Danmark is to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes.", "Broadcasting may be by means of radio equipment, satellite or cable systems.", "The public-service obligations of TV2/Danmark are determined by the Minister for Culture.", "4", "Apart from the public broadcasters, commercial broadcasters also operate on the nationwide television market in Denmark.", "These include, first, Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd (‘Viasat’) and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (‘SBS’).", "5", "TV2/Danmark was initially set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of Danmarks Radio, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers.", "The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike Danmarks Radio, TV2/Danmark would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.", "6", "Following a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting SA/Tv Danmark, the system for funding TV2/Danmark was examined by the Commission in its Decision 2006/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for TV2/Danmark (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 112; ‘the TV2 I decision’).", "That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: license fee resources, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2/Danmark (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2/Danmark at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees by TV2/Danmark for the use of nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, ‘the measures concerned’).", "Last, the Commission’s investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2/Danmark to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2’s public-service programmes through those installations.", "7", "After examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, on the ground that the funding system for TV2/Danmark, which sought to offset the cost of that undertaking’s public service provision, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415; as regards those conditions, ‘the Altmark conditions’).", "8", "The Commission further decided that that aid, granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2/Danmark, was compatible with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU, with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish crowns (DKK) (approximately EUR 85 million) which it classified as ‘overcompensation’.", "The Commission accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2/Danmark.", "9", "The TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2/Danmark (Case T‑309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T‑317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2/Danmark, Viasat (Case T‑329/04) and SBS (Case T‑336/04).", "10", "By judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission (T‑309/04, T‑317/04, T‑329/04 and T‑336/04, EU:T:2008:457), the General Court annulled that decision.", "In its judgment, the General Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that the public-service mission of TV2/Danmark was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest.", "The General Court also found, however, several instances of illegality that vitiated the TV2 I decision.", "11", "First, in examining the question whether the measures covered by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the General Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons why it took advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, in order to decide whether or not State resources were involved.", "Second, the General Court held that the Commission’s examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the specific legal and economic considerations which governed how the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2/Danmark was set.", "The TV2 I decision was consequently vitiated by a failure to state sufficient reasons on that point.", "Third, the General Court held that the Commission’s findings on the compatibility of the aid under Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons.", "According to the General Court, that failure to state sufficient reasons was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the specific legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2/Danmark during the period under investigation.", "12", "Following the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned.", "At that time, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2/Danmark and, furthermore, received observations from third parties.", "13", "On the conclusion of that examination, the Commission adopted the contested decision.", "14", "That decision concerns the measures implemented for TV2/Danmark between 1995 and 2002.", "However, in its examination, the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.", "15", "In the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as ‘State aid’ within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, the Commission concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions.", "However, whereas in the TV2 I decision the Commission had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million (approximately EUR 85 million) was overcompensation incompatible with Article 106(2) TFEU, in the contested decision it took the view that that sum was for TV2/Danmark an appropriate capital buffer.", "In the operative part of that decision, the Commission stated the

"25", "The Kingdom of Denmark claims that the Court should dismiss the appeal.", "The appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "26", "In support of its appeal, the Commission relies on a single ground of appeal, whereby it submits, in essence, that the General Court, in holding that the Commission had wrongly classified as ‘State aid’ the advertising revenue for the years 1995 and 1996 transferred from TV2 Reklame A/S to TV2/Danmark, through the TV2 Fund, misinterpreted the concept of ‘State resources’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "27", "In that regard, the Commission submits that, since TV2 Reklame was a public undertaking whose entire share capital was owned by the Danish State, that company was wholly under the control and at the disposal of the Danish State, and consequently the resources of that company had to be regarded as constituting State resources, within the meaning of that provision.", "28", "In particular, the Commission argues that the source of the resources concerned is of no relevance for the purposes of such a classification and that the initially private nature of those resources cannot prevent them being characterised as State resources.", "29", "The General Court, however, according to the Commission, erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 208, 211 and 212 of the judgment under appeal, that resources obtained from third parties, such as public undertakings, were to be regarded as State resources only if those resources had been voluntarily placed at the disposal of the State by their owners, or abandoned by those owners and managed by the State.", "30", "The Commission also considers that there is no need to investigate whether the State exercises control over the resources concerned, since the control exercised by the State over a public undertaking implies that it exercises control over the resources of that undertaking.", "31", "Accordingly, the Commission considers that, in paragraphs 212, 214 and 215 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court erred in law in giving an overly restrictive interpretation of the concept of ‘control’ in its assessment of whether the Danish State exercised, through the TV2 Fund, control over the resources transferred from TV2 Reklame to TV2/Danmark.", "32", "In that context, the Commission submits that the decisive factor is not whether the Danish authorities, in this case the Minister for Culture, did in fact have those resources at their disposal and decide how to use them, but the fact that that possibility was open to them.", "Accordingly, the fact that, for the years 1995 and 1996, the Minister for Culture decided to transfer the entire profits of TV2 Reklame to the TV2 Fund is of no relevance for the purposes of the question of whether those resources were controlled by the State, when it was open to the Minister for Culture to decide that those resources would be used for a purpose other than such a transfer.", "33", "Moreover, according to the Commission, the General Court, in paragraphs 209 and 213 of the judgment under appeal, misinterpreted the judgment of 13 March 2001, PreussenElektra (C‑379/98, EU:C:2001:160), and drew an inappropriate parallel between that judgment and the present case.", "34", "The EFTA Surveillance Authority and Viasat concur with the Commission that the General Court erred in law in holding that the advertising revenue concerned did not constitute ‘State resources’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, and, consequently, did not constitute State aid, within the meaning of that provision.", "35", "TV2/Danmark and the Kingdom of Denmark dispute the Commission’s arguments.", "36", "They contend, inter alia, that the Danish State’s control over the advertising revenue paid to TV2/Danmark through the TV2 Fund in the years 1995 and 1996 was theoretical, since the possibility of having that revenue at its disposal was subject to the condition that the funding requirements of TV2/Danmark had first been met, and since, in reality, that revenue was transferred in its entirety to TV2/Danmark.", "37", "TV2/Danmark and the Kingdom of Denmark consider that the Commission’s reasoning is based on a misinterpretation of Danish law.", "38", "Further, TV2/Danmark and the Kingdom of Denmark consider that the General Court did not err in law in making a connection between the circumstances at issue in the present case and the situation that gave rise to the judgment of 13 March 2001, PreussenElektra (C‑379/98, EU:C:2001:160).", "39", "Last, the Kingdom of Denmark considers that the distinction made by the General Court between the advertising revenue transferred from TV2 Reklame to TV2/Danmark through the TV2 Fund and the radio and television licence fee resources transferred from the TV2 Fund to TV2/Danmark is justified by the fact that the source of the former consisted of payments made by private advertisers to TV2 Reklame, whereas the latter consists of the proceeds of a tax levied by the State in order to ensure the funding of the Danish public broadcasting service.", "Findings of the Court", "40", "In accordance with the Court’s settled case-law, a classification as ‘aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, requires that all the conditions set out in that provision are fulfilled (see judgment of 17 July 2008, Essent Netwerk Noord and Others, C‑206/06, EU:C:2008:413, paragraph 63 and the case-law cited).", "41", "That provision sets out four conditions.", "First, there must be intervention by the State or through State resources.", "Second, that intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States.", "Third, it must confer an advantage on the recipient.", "Fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see judgments of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 75; of 17 July 2008, Essent Netwerk Noord and Others, C‑206/06, EU:C:2008:413, paragraph 64; and of 19 December 2013, Association Vent De Colère! and Others, C‑262/12, EU:C:2013:851, paragraph 15).", "42", "In this case, only the first of those conditions is at issue.", "43", "As regards that condition, that the advantage must be granted directly or indirectly through State resources, it must be recalled that measures not involving a transfer of State resources may fall within the concept of ‘aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU (see, inter alia, judgments of 16 May 2002, France v Commission, C‑482/99, EU:C:2002:294, paragraph 36; of 30 May 2013, Doux Élevage and Coopérative agricole UKL-ARREE, C‑677/11, EU:C:2013:348, paragraph 34; and of 19 December 2013, Association Vent De Colère! and Others, C‑262/12, EU:C:2013:851, paragraph 19).", "44", "Accordingly, the concept of intervention ‘through State resources’, within the meaning of that provision, is intended to cover, in addition to advantages granted directly by the State, those granted through a public or private body appointed or established by that State to administer the aid (see judgments of 13 March 2001, PreussenElektra, C‑379/98, EU:C:2001:160, paragraph 58; of 30 May 2013, Doux Élevage and Coopérative agricole UKL-ARREE, C‑677/11, EU:C:2013:348, paragraph 26; and of 19 December 2013, Association Vent De Colère! and Others, C‑262/12, EU:C:2013:851, paragraph 20).", "45", "EU law cannot permit the rules on State aid to be circumvented merely through the creation of autonomous institutions charged with allocating aid (see judgment of 16 May 2002, France v Commission, C‑482/99, EU:C:2002:294, paragraph 23).", "46", "Further, it must be recalled that, in accordance with the Court’s settled case-law, Article 107(1) TFEU covers all the financial means by which the public authorities may actually support undertakings, irrespective of whether or not those means are permanent assets of the State.", "Therefore, even if the sums corresponding to the measure in question are not permanently held by the Treasury, the fact that they constantly remain under public control, and therefore available to the competent national authorities, is sufficient for them to be categorised as ‘State resources’ (see judgments of 16 May 2002, France v Commission, C‑482/99, EU:C:2002:294, paragraph 37; of 17 July 2008, Essent Netwerk Noord and Others, C‑206/06, EU:C:2008:413, paragraph 70; of 30 May 2013, Doux Élevage and Coopérative agricole UKL-ARREE, C‑677/11, EU:C:2013:348, paragraph 35; and of 19 December 2013, Association Vent De Colère! and Others, C‑262/12, EU:C:2013:851, paragraph 21).", "47", "It follows that, since the resources of public undertakings are subject to the control of the State and are therefore at its disposal, those resources fall within the scope of the concept of ‘State resources’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "The State is perfectly capable, by exercising its dominant influence over such undertakings, of directing the use of their resources in order, as the occasion arises, to finance specific advantages in favour of other undertakings (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 May 2002, France v Commission, C‑482/99, EU:C:2002:294, paragraph 38).", "48", "The fact that the resources concerned may be administered by entities that are distinct from the public authorities or that the source of those resources may be private is of no significance in that regard (see, to that effect, judgments of 2 July 1974, Italy v Commission, 173/73, EU:C:1974:71, paragraph 35, and of 8 May 2003, Italy and SIM 2 Multimedia v Commission, C‑328/99 and C‑399/00, EU:C:2003:252, paragraph 33).", "49", "As stated by the General Court, in paragraph 176 of the judgment under appeal, in the years 1995 and 1996, the advertising space on TV2/Danmark was sold not by TV2/Danmark itself, but by a third company, TV2 Reklame, and the income from those sales was transferred to TV2/Danmark through the TV2 Fund.", "50", "In that regard, it is not disputed that, like TV2/Danmark, TV2 Reklame and the TV2 Fund were public undertakings owned by the Danish State, and they had been delegated the task of administering the transfer, to TV2/Danmark, of the revenue deriving from the sale of that advertising space.", "51", "Accordingly, the entire distribution channel of that revenue ending with its transfer to TV2/Danmark was governed by Danish legislation, under which public undertakings specially appointed by the State had the task of administering that revenue.", "52", "The revenue in question was, accordingly, under public control and at the disposal of the State, which could decide how it was to be used.", "53", "Consequently, in accordance with the Court’s case-law cited in paragraphs 43 to 48 of the present judgment, the revenue at issue constitutes ‘State resources’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "54", "It follows that the General Court erred in law in holding, in paragraph 220 of the judgment under appeal, that the revenue for the years 1995 and 1996, derived from the sale, by TV2 Reklame, of advertising space on TV2/Danmark, and transferred to TV2/Danmark through the TV2 Fund, did not constitute State resources and that, therefore, the Commission had wrongly classified that revenue as ‘State aid’.", "55", "As stated above in paragraph 48 of the present judgment, and contrary to what is stated in paragraph 211 of the judgment under appeal, the fact that the source of that revenue, which came from advertisers, was private is of no significance in that regard and is irrelevant to the question whether that revenue was controlled by the Danish authorities.", "56", "Moreover, the General Court was wrong to hold, in paragraphs 208 and 212 of the judgment under appeal, that resources originating with third parties that are managed by public undertakings can constitute State resources only when they are voluntarily placed at the disposal of the State by their owners or abandoned by their owners and when the State has assumed the management of those resources.", "57", "Contrary to what is stated by the General Court, there is no basis for such a consideration in the Court’s case-law.", "58", "The same is true of the arguments, in paragraphs 214, 215 and 217 of the judgment under appeal, that only the part of that revenue which, by a decision of the Minister for Culture, was not transferred to TV2/Danmark was capable of constituting a State resource and that the fact that there was no obligation to transfer that revenue each year from the TV2 Fund to TV2/Danmark could not permit a different finding.", "59", "As stated in paragraphs 49 to 52 of the present judgment, the existence of public control over the advertising revenue at issue was due to the fact that that revenue was administered by public undertakings owned by the Danish State.", "It is moreover undisputed that, under the Danish legislation, it was open to the Minister for Culture to decide that that revenue would be used for a purpose other than transfer to the TV2 Fund.", "60", "Last, the situation at issue in the present case is not comparable to the situation in the case that gave rise to the judgment of 13 March 2001, PreussenElektra (C‑379/98, EU:C:2001:160), in which the Court held that the obligation imposed on private electricity supply undertakings to purchase electricity produced from renewable energy sources at fixed minimum prices did not involve any direct or indirect transfer of State resources to undertakings which produced that type of electricity (see judgments of 13 March 2001, PreussenElektra, C‑379/98, EU:C:2001:160, paragraph 59; of 17 July 2008, Essent Netwerk Noord and Others, C‑206/06, EU:C:2008:413, paragraph 74; and of 19 December 2013, Association Vent De Colère! and Others, C‑262/12, EU:C:2013:851, paragraph 34).", "61", "The latter case related to private undertakings that had not been appointed by the State to administer a State resource, but were bound by an obligation to purchase by means of their own financial resources (see judgments of 17 July 2008, Essent Netwerk Noord and Others, C‑206/06, EU:C:2008:413, paragraph 74; of 19 December 2013, Association Vent De Colère! and Others, C‑262/12, EU:C:2013:851, paragraph 35; and order of 22 October 2014, Elcogás, C‑275/13, not published, EU:C:2014:2314, paragraph 32).", "62", "Further, in that case, the funds at issue could not be regarded as a State resource, since they were at no time under public control (see judgment of 19 December 2013, Association Vent De Colère! and Others, C‑262/12, EU:C:2013:851, paragraph 36, and order of 22 October 2014, Elcogás, C‑275/13, not published, EU:C:2014:2314, paragraph 32).", "63", "As stated above, however, the present case concerns public undertakings, namely TV2 Reklame and the TV2 Fund, that were created, owned and appointed by the Danish State to administer the revenue produced by the sale of advertising space of another public undertaking, namely TV2/Danmark, and as a consequence that revenue was under the control and at the disposal of the Danish State.", "64", "Consequently, the General Court erred in law in holding, in paragraph 213 of the judgment under appeal, that the situation at issue in the present case was comparable to the situation in the case that gave rise to the judgment of 13 March 2001, PreussenElektra (C‑379/98, EU:C:2001:160).", "65", "That being the case, the single ground of appeal relied on by the Commission in support of its appeal must be upheld and the judgment under appeal must be set aside, to the extent that it annulled the contested decision in so far as the Commission had held that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 paid to TV2/Danmark through the TV2 Fund constituted State aid.", "The action before the General Court", "66", "In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, if the appeal is well founded, the Court of Justice is to quash the decision of the General Court.", "The Court may then itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits, or refer the case back to the General Court for judgment.", "67", "In this case, the Court considers that it should give final judgment on the action brought by TV2/Danmark seeking the annulment of the contested decision.", "68", "In that regard, suffice it to state that, for the reasons stated in paragraphs 43 to 64 of the present judgment, the fourth plea in law relied on by TV2/Danmark in support of the third head of claim, in the alternative, must be rejected.", "69", "Accordingly, the action brought by TV2/Danmark must be dismissed.", "Costs", "70", "Under Article 184(2) of the Court’s Rules of Procedure, where an appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the

EU:T:2015:117), by which that court dismissed its application for annulment of Commission Decision 2012/540/EU of 20 December 2011 on State aid C 25/08 (ex NN 23/08) — reform of the arrangements for financing the retirement pensions of civil servants working for France Télécom implemented by the French Republic in favour of France Télécom (OJ 2012 L 279, p. 1) (‘the decision at issue’).", "Background to the dispute", "2", "The background to the dispute is summarised as follows in paragraphs 1 to 19 of the judgment under appeal:", "‘1.", "The measures covered by the present case are the changes introduced in 1996 to the scheme of contributions borne by the applicant, Orange, then called France Télécom, with regard to the payment of the retirement pensions of its staff members with civil servant status.", "2", "That scheme, which had been established at the time of the foundation, in 1990, of France Télécom as an undertaking distinct from the State administration, by Law No 90-568 of 2 July 1990 on the organisation of the public postal and telecommunications service (JORF of 8 July 1990, p. 8069, “the 1990 Law”), was modified by Law No 96-660 of 26 July 1996 on the national company France Télécom (JORF of 26 July 1996, p. 11398, “the 1996 Law”).", "The new scheme was introduced at a time when France Télécom was set up as a public limited company, listed on the stock exchange and had an increasing share of its capital opened up to private investment, and also when the markets in which it operated, in France and in other Member States of the European Union, were fully opened up to competition.", "3", "As to responsibilities concerning the financing of social security benefits for staff members with civil servant status, the 1996 Law changed the amount which Article 30 of the 1990 Law required France Télécom to pay to the Public Treasury in return for the payment and servicing of the pensions of its civil servants effected by the State (“the contested measure”).", "4", "The 1990 Law provided that France Télécom was required to pay to the Public Treasury, in return for the payment and servicing of the pensions granted to its civil servants, the amount of the deduction made from the salary of the civil servant, the level of which was fixed by Article L. 61 of the French Civilian and Military Retirement Pensions Code, and an additional contribution sufficient to fund, in full, the pensions that had been and were to be granted to their retired civil servants.", "5", "France Télécom also participated in the so-called “compensation” and “over-compensation” schemes, which provided for transfers in order to ensure equilibrium with the pension schemes for civil servants of other public entities.", "6", "The 1996 Law changed the compensation payable under Article 30 of the 1990 Law as follows.", "First, France Télécom was required to pay the amount deducted from the salary of the civil servants, this amount remaining the same as under the 1990 Law.", "Secondly, it was subjected to an “employer’s contribution in full discharge of liabilities”, which replaced the previous employer’s contribution.", "This new contribution was based on a “competitively fair rate” which, in turn, was based on equalisation of the levels of wage-related mandatory social security contributions and tax payments between France Télécom and the other undertakings in the telecommunications sector subject to the ordinary social security arrangements, in respect of risks which are common to ordinary employees and civil servants, and excluding risks which are not common to ordinary employees and civil servants (in particular, unemployment and the claims of employees in the event of the undertaking going into administration or liquidation).", "Thirdly, France Télécom was subjected to an “exceptional flat-rate contribution”, the amount of which was fixed by the Finance Law for 1997 (Law No 96-1181 of 31 December 1996, JORF of 31 December 1996, p. 19490) at FRF 37.5 billion (equivalent to EUR 5.7 billion).", "This contribution included the amount of the annual provisions (EUR 3.6 billion) that France Télécom had set aside, up to 1996, against the cost of the future civil servant pensions which were anticipated at that time, as well as an additional amount (EUR 2.1 billion).", "7", "The 1996 Law also excluded France Télécom from the scope of the compensation and over-compensation schemes.", "…", "9", "By letter of 20 May 2008, the Commission informed the French Republic of its decision to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 108(2) TFEU (“the decision to initiate the investigation procedure”) in respect of the aid at issue.", "The French Republic submitted its observations on 18 July 2008.", "…", "12", "On 20 December 2011, the Commission adopted the [decision at issue], which declares the aid at issue to be compatible with the internal market on certain conditions.", "13", "In the [decision at issue], the Commission concluded that the contested measure constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "14", "In relation particularly to the assessment of economic advantage, the Commission established that the contested measure conferred an economic advantage on France Télécom, in that it imposed a new and substantial burden on the State in relation to the payment and servicing of the pensions granted to the civil servants of France Télécom, while reducing the compensation payable by France Télécom.", "15", "In this regard, the Commission, first, in recital 105 of the [decision at issue], calculated the amount of the aid in question as the annual difference between the contribution in full discharge of liabilities paid by France Télécom pursuant to the 1996 Law and the costs that it would have paid pursuant to the 1990 Law, and, secondly, in recital 113 of the [decision at issue], indicated its view that the payment of the exceptional flat-rate contribution had reduced the amount of aid from which France Télécom benefited.", "16", "The Commission also established that the contested measure was selective in that it concerned only France Télécom, and that it distorted or threatened to distort competition, as the balance sheet of France Télécom was relieved of liabilities and costs, which enabled it to develop on the markets for telecommunications which were gradually opened to competition, in France and in other Member States.", "17", "The Commission proceeded to assess the compatibility of the contested measure with the internal market, within the meaning of Article 107(3)(c) TFEU, concluding that it did not comply with the principle of proportionality, in that it did not allow a level playing field.", "According to the Commission, the compensation paid by France Télécom to the State was not equal to all the social security costs to which the budgets of its competitors were subject.", "18", "Accordingly, the Commission established that, in order to fulfill the criterion of common interest under Article 107(3) TFEU, for the aid at issue to be compatible with the internal market it was necessary for the employer’s contribution in full discharge of liabilities payable by France Télécom to be calculated and levied so as to equalise the levels of all the wage-based mandatory social security contributions and tax payments between France Télécom and the other undertakings of the telecommunications sector covered by the ordinary social security arrangements, taking into account not only the risks common to ordinary employees and civil servants, but also the non-common risks.", "This contribution was to be levied on France Télécom from the day on which the amount of the exceptional flat-rate contribution, capitalised at the discount rate resulting from the application of the Commission notice on the method for setting the reference and discount rates (OJ 1996 C 232, p. 10, “the notice on reference rates”), equaled the amount of the contributions and costs that France Télécom would have been required to pay under Article 30 of the 1990 Law.", "19", "The operative part of the [decision at issue] is worded as follows:", "“Article 1", "The State aid resulting from the reduction of the compensation to be paid to the State for the payment and servicing of the pensions granted, pursuant to the Civilian and Military Retirement Pensions Code, to the civil servants of France Télécom pursuant to [the 1996 Law] amending [the 1990 Law] shall be compatible with the internal market on the conditions provided for in Article 2.", "Article 2", "The employer’s contribution in full discharge of liabilities, payable by France Télécom under Article 30, point (c) of [the 1990 Law], shall be calculated and levied so as to equalise the levels of all the wage-based social security contributions and tax payments between France Télécom and the other undertakings of the telecommunications sector covered by the ordinary social security arrangements.", "To fulfil this condition, no later than within seven months of the notification of the present decision, the French Republic:", "(a)", "shall amend Article 30 of [the 1990 Law] and the regulatory or other texts adopted to implement it so that the bases for calculating and levying the employer’s contribution in full discharge of liabilities, payable by France Télécom, are not confined solely to the risks common to ordinary employees and civil servants, but also include the non-common risks;", "(b)", "shall levy on France Télécom, from the day on which the amounts of the exceptional contribution introduced by [the 1996 Law] capitalised at the discount rate resulting from the application of the [notice on reference rates] applicable in this case equal the amount of the contributions and costs that France Télécom would have continued to pay under Article 30 of [the 1990 Law] in its initial wording, an employer’s contribution with full discharge of liabilities calculated according to the terms specified in point (a), taking into account the risks that are common and not common to ordinary employees and civil servants.", "…”’", "Procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal", "3", "By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 22 August 2012, Orange brought an action for the annulment of the decision at issue.", "4", "In support of its action, Orange put forward four pleas in law, the first alleging errors of law, manifest errors of assessment and infringement of the obligation to state reasons, in so far as the Commission took the view that the measure at issue constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "5", "By the judgment under appeal, the General Court dismissed the application in its entirety and ordered Orange to pay the costs .", "Forms of order sought by the parties", "6", "Orange claims that the Court should:", "—", "set aside the judgment under appeal and annul the decision at issue;", "—", "in the alternative, set aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court;", "—", "order the Commission to pay the costs.", "7", "The Commission contends that the Court should:", "—", "dismiss the appeal; and", "—", "order Orange to pay the costs.", "The request to reopen the oral procedure", "8", "After judgment was delivered by the General Court on 14 July 2016 in Germany v Commission (T‑143/12, EU:T:2016:406), Orange requested, by document lodged at the Registry of the Court of Justice on 26 July 2016, that the oral stage of the procedure be reopened.", "9", "In support of that request, Orange maintains, in essence, that the conclusion reached by the General Court in the judgment under appeal concerning the existence of a selective economic advantage is irreconcilable with the conclusion reached in the judgment of 14 July 2016 and that the legal considerations relating to that judgment were directly relevant to the assessment of the first and second grounds of appeal in the present case.", "10", "In that regard, it must be recalled that, under Article 83 of the Court’s Rules of Procedure, the Court may at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the opening or reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where a party has, after the close of that part of the procedure, submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court (judgment of 22 June 2016, DK Recycling und Roheisen v Commission, C‑540/14 P, EU:C:2016:469, paragraph 28).", "11", "That is not the position in the present case.", "The Court, after hearing the Advocate General, considers that it has all the information necessary to give a ruling and that the case does not have to be examined in the light of a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for its decision or of an argument which has not been debated before it.", "12", "In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to order that the oral part of the procedure be reopened.", "The appeal", "First ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court erred in law in its assessment as to whether the contested measure was to be classified as State aid", "First part of the first ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court erred in law in its assessment regarding the existence of an advantage", "– Arguments of the parties", "13", "In the first place, Orange submits that the General Court erred in law by holding, in paragraphs 42 and 43 of the judgment under appeal, that the allegedly compensatory nature of the contested measure did not preclude it being categorised as State aid on the ground that it is only in so far as a State measure must be regarded as compensation for services provided in fulfillment of public service obligations, in accordance with the criteria established by the Court in the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), that such a measure falls outside Article 107(1) TFEU.", "14", "Contrary to the view taken by the General Court, the Court of Justice did not rule out the possibility, in paragraph 97 of the judgment of 9 June 2011, Comitato Venezia vuole vivere and Others v Commission (C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P, EU:C:2011:368), that the compensatory nature of measures other than those connected with services provided in performance of public service obligations might preclude their categorisation as State aid.", "15", "In the second place, Orange contends that the General Court’s assessment is at odds with the judgment of 23 March 2006, Enirisorse (C‑237/04, EU:C:2006:197), in which the Court of Justice held that a derogation from general Italian law did not fall within the definition of State aid, on the ground that a law which merely prevents an undertaking’s budget being burdened with a charge which, in a normal situation, would not have existed, does not confer an advantage on that undertaking for the purpose of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "16", "First, contrary to what the General Court stated in paragraphs 39 to 41 of the judgment under appeal, there is nothing in the judgment of 23 March 2006, Enirisorse (C‑237/04, EU:C:2006:197), to suggest that the applicability of that case-law is confined to what are referred to as ‘dual derogation’ arrangements, that is to say arrangements whereby, in order to prevent the budget of the beneficiary of the measure being burdened with a charge which, in a normal situation, would not have existed, provision is made for a derogation intended to neutralise a previous derogation from the general system in place.", "17", "Second, Orange contends that the 1990 Law imposed an obligation on France Télécom to which its competitors were not subject, thus creating an abnormal burden within the meaning of the case-law cited above, for which the 1996 Law provided a remedy.", "18", "In the third place, Orange states that, in paragraph 41 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took as its reference framework, for the purpose of determining whether the 1996 Law conferred an advantage, the original scheme applicable to France Télécom civil servants under the 1990 Law.", "19", "Orange submits that the objective of the 1996 Law was to place France Télécom in a situation governed by general law as regards the arrangements for financing the retirement pensions of civil servants working for France Télécom and that, in the light of that objective, the relevant reference framework was that applicable to competing undertakings in respect of employers’ contributions to the retirement pensions of their staff.", "20", "Therefore, according to Orange, the General Court erred in law by endorsing the Commission’s choice of reference framework.", "21", "The Commission disputes Orange’s arguments.", "– Findings of the Court", "22", "It should be noted at the outset that, by the second and third arguments of the first part of the first ground of appeal, as summarised in paragraphs 15 to 20 above, Orange contends that the French State did not confer any economic advantage on it when it adopted the 1996 Law.", "By the first argument of the first part, summarised in paragraphs 13 and 14 above, that company maintains that, even if that law had conferred such an advantage, it would simply have compensated for the structural disadvantage to which it was subject under the arrangements introduced by the 1990 Law by comparison with its competitors, so that such an advantage could not justify a finding of State aid.", "23", "As regards the arguments alleging that it did not enjoy an economic advantage, Orange submitted before the General Court that it was apparent from the judgment of 23 March 2006, Enirisorse (C‑237/04, EU:C:2006:197), that a law which merely prevents an undertaking’s budget being burdened with a charge which, in a normal situation, would not have existed, does not confer an advantage on that undertaking for the purpose of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "24", "Moreover, Orange argued before the General Court that the Commission’s choice of reference framework for the purpose of determining whether it enjoyed an economic advantage, that is the scheme applicable to France Télécom under the 1990 Law, as opposed to the scheme applicable to competing undertakings, was incorrect in law and vitiated by manifest errors of assessment.", "25", "In paragraphs 38 to 41 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court dismissed the argument based on the judgment of 23 March 2006 Enirisorse (C‑237/04, EU:C:2006:197), taking the view that that case-law was applicable only in cases involving ‘dual derogation’ arrangements, that is to say arrangements whereby, in order to prevent the budget of the beneficiary of the measure being burdened with a charge which, in a normal situation, would not have existed, provision is made for a derogation intended to neutralise a previous derogation from the general system in place, which was not the case here.", "26", "That assessment is not vitiated by the errors of law alleged by Orange in the second argument of the first part of the first ground of appeal.", "27", "It should be noted in that regard that, in paragraphs 46 to 48 of the judgment of 23 March 2016, Enirisorse (C‑237/04, EU:C:2006:197), the Court held that national legislation which offers an advantage neither to shareholders of a company nor to the company itself, in so far as it merely prevents its budget being burdened with a charge which, in a normal situation, would not have existed and therefore simply regulates an exceptional right and without seeking to reduce a charge which that company would normally have had to bear cannot be regarded as an advantage within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "28", "It should be noted, as observed by the Advocate General in point 42 of his Opinion, that a particular feature of the situation which gave rise to the judgment of 23 March 2006, Enirisorse (C‑237/04, EU:C:2006:197), was that it concerned a national measure which had the effect of neutralising the effects of a system which derogated from the general system in place.", "29", "In the present case, the General Court found, in its assessment of the facts in paragraph 41 of the judgment under appeal, against which there is no appeal, that the arrangements for the retirement pensions of France Télécom civil servants were legally distinct and clearly separate from the arrangements applicable to ordinary employees.", "It inferred from this that the latter arrangements were not the arrangements normally applicable to France Télécom civil servants, so that the 1996 Law had not removed an abnormal burden borne by the budget of that undertaking or reverted to the normal arrangements.", "30", "In those circumstances, the General Court did not err in law in finding, in paragraph 41 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘it [was] not possible to conclude, as [did] the applicant, that the measure at issue was intended to prevent France Télécom being subject to a charge which, in a normal situation, should not be borne by its budget within the meaning of the judgment [of 23 March 2006, Enirisorse (C‑237/04, EU:C:2006:197)]’.", "31", "As a consequence, the second argument of the first part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "32", "With regard to the third argument of the first part of the first ground of appeal, concerning the choice of reference framework, it should be noted that the General Court held, in paragraph 37 of the judgment under appeal, that by reducing the social security contributions introduced by the 1990 Law, the 1996 Law conferred, in principle, an advantage on France Télécom.", "33", "Moreover, as noted in paragraph 29 above, the General Court held in paragraph 41 of the judgment under appeal that the arrangements for the retirement pensions of civil servants derive from a regime that is legally distinct and clearly separate from the regime applicable to ordinary employees, such as the employees of France Télécom’s competitors, and that the 1990 Law did not introduce derogating arrangements, as the contributions to the pensions of civil servants had not previously been subject to the ordinary arrangements for pension contributions.", "34", "The General Court thus dismissed Orange’s argument that, for the purpose of determining whether or not France Télécom enjoyed an economic advantage, the Commission had used an incorrect reference framework.", "35", "By the third argument of the first part of the first ground of appeal, as summarised in paragraphs 18 to 20 above, Orange does not dispute, as the Commission was correct to observe, the assessment set out in paragraph 37 of the judgment under appeal and simply takes issue with the General Court for failing to take into account, in identifying the correct reference framework, the French State’s objectives when it adopted the 1996 Law.", "36", "Orange maintains, in essence, that the objective of the 1996 Law was to restore the general law conditions as regards the arrangements for financing the retirement pensions of civil servants working for France Télécom and thus place the company in the same situation as that of its competitors.", "Accordingly, and in the light of the objectives of the 1996 Law, the ‘standard’ situation to be adopted for the purpose of determining whether that law had the effect of eliminating a normal or an abnormal cost would be that of a private operator.", "37", "Accordingly, Orange’s line of argument does not enable the Court to ascertain whether, when it rejected that company’s objection that the Commission had chosen the incorrect reference framework, the General Court committed other errors of law than the error based on failure to take account of the French State’s objectives.", "38", "In that regard, it is the Court’s established case-law that Article 107(1) TFEU does not distinguish between measures of State intervention by reference to their causes or their aims but defines them in relation to their effects (judgment of 9 June 2011, Comitato Venezia vuole vivere and Others v Commission, C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P, EU:C:2011:368, paragraph 94 and the case-law cited).", "39", "It follows that the third argument of the first part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected as manifestly unfounded.", "40", "As regards the first argument of the first part of the first ground of appeal, concerning compensation for a structural disadvantage, Orange relied at first instance on the judgments of the General Court of 16 March 2004, Danske Busvognmænd v Commission (T‑157/01, EU:T:2004:76), and of 28 November 2008, Hotel Cipriani and Others v Commission (T‑254/00, T‑270/00 and T‑277/00, EU:T:2008:537), in support of its claim that an advantage eliminating additional burdens which were imposed by derogating arrangements and were not borne by competing undertakings does not constitute State aid.", "Indeed, according to Orange, compensation for a structural disadvantage may preclude the categorisation of a measure as State aid in certain specific situations, not merely in cases involving services of general public interest.", "41", "The General Court rejected that argument in paragraphs 42 and 43 of the judgment under appeal, stating that, even on the assumption that it were established, the compensatory nature of the costs reduction granted in the present case would not make it possible to preclude the categorisation of that measure as State aid.", "42", "The General Court stated in that regard that it is apparent from the case-law of the Court of Justice, in particular paragraphs 90 to 92 of the judgment of 9 June 2011, Comitato Venezia vuole vivere and Others v Commission (C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P, EU:C:2011:368), that it is only in so far as a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by undertakings entrusted with performing a service in the general public interest in order to discharge public service obligations in accordance with the criteria established in the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), that such a measure falls outside Article 107(1) TFEU.", "43", "Those findings are not vitiated by any of the error of law alleged by Orange in its first argument in the first part of the first plea in law.", "44", "Indeed, it is clear that, to date, the only situation recognised by the Court’s case-law in which the finding that an economic advantage has been granted does not lead to the measure at issue being categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU is that in which a State measure represents the compensation for the services provided by undertakings entrusted with performing a service in the general public interest in order to discharge public service obligations, in accordance with the criteria established in the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg (C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415).", "45", "The General Court was therefore entitled to take the view that Orange could not derive valid arguments from the judgments of the General Court cited in paragraph 40 above in order to establish that compensation for a structural disadvantage may preclude a measure being categorised as State aid.", "46", "It follows that the first argument of the first part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "47", "In the light of the foregoing, the first part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected.", "The second part of the first ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court erred in law in its assessment of the selective nature of the contested measure", "– Arguments of the parties", "48", "Orange submits that the General Court erred in law in finding, in paragraphs 52 and 53 of the judgment under appeal, that the contested measure is selective because it concerns only Orange.", "49", "According to Orange, an individual measure is selective only if it favours a specific undertaking in comparison with others which are in a comparable legal and factual situation.", "Orange cites, in that connection, the judgments of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia (C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 40), and of 16 April 2015, Trapeza Eurobank Ergasias (C‑690/13, EU:C:2015:235, paragraph 28).", "50", "Given that, if a measure is selective, that involves an unequal distribution of advantages as between undertakings in a comparable factual and legal situation, it is not possible to carry out an assessment without comparing the operators in such a situation.", "51", "As the Commission concluded that there were no other undertakings that came within the reference framework defined by it, Orange submits that the General Court was not entitled simply to presume that the selectivity criterion was met in view of the ad hoc nature of the contested measure.", "52", "The Commission disputes Orange’s arguments.", "– Findings of the Court", "53", "The General Court stated in paragraphs 52 and 53 of the judgment under appeal that the 1996 Law affected only France Télécom and that, as a result, it was selective.", "According to the General Court, the test requiring a comparison of the beneficiary with other operators in a comparable factual and legal situation in the light of the aim pursued by the measure in question is based on, and justified by, the assessment of whether measures of potentially general application are selective and that test is therefore irrelevant where, as in the present case, it would amount to assessing the selective nature of an ad hoc measure which concerns just one undertaking and is intended to modify certain competitive constraints which are specific to the undertaking.", "54", "As those findings are, as observed by the Advocate General in points 66 to 72 of his Opinion, consistent with the Court’s case-law in this field (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C‑15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 60),  they are not vitiated by any error of law and, as a result, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "The third part of the first ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court erred in law in its assessment of whether competition was affected", "– Arguments of the parties", "55", "Orange claims that the General Court erred in law and failed in its duty to state reasons in holding, in paragraphs 63 and 64 of the judgment under appeal, that the requirement that competition be affected was satisfied as the financial resources which were freed by the measure at issue were capable of being used to promote the development of Orange’s activities on markets which had been newly opened up to competition, and that that company had itself acknowledged that that measure had been indispensable in enabling Orange to play a part in the development of competition.", "56", "According to Orange, while those two factors might establish that, by ensuring merit-based competition, the contested measure had a positive impact on competition, they are not sufficient to justify the General Court’s conclusion that that measure was indeed such as to distort or threaten to distort competition.", "57", "If the General Court had carried out a thorough review of the assessments made by the Commission in reaching the conclusion that the requirement that competition be affected was satisfied, it may have concluded that the existence of such an anticompetitive effect had not been properly established, since the reference framework established included Orange alone, and that the Commission had acknowledged that the measure at issue was necessary in order to ensure merit-based competition in a market which was being opened up to competition.", "58", "The Commission disputes Orange’s arguments.", "– Findings of the Court", "59", "In paragraphs 63 and 64 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected Orange’s arguments summarised in paragraph 57 above by stating, first of all, that the financial resources released by the measure at issue were capable of being used to promote the development of France Télécom’s activities on markets which had been newly opened up to competition in France and in other Member States.", "60", "Next, the General Court observed that Orange had itself acknowledged that the contested measure had had a significant impact on competition in that it had been indispensable in enabling it to play a part in the development of competition.", "61", "Lastly, the General Court considered that the question whether the contested measure was necessary to enable France Télécom to deal with its alleged competitive disadvantage was relevant, not to the requirement that competition be distorted, but to the requirement that there should be an advantage, and that this had been examined in connection with the first part of the first plea in law at first instance.", "62", "Accordingly, first, as the Advocate General observed in point 75 of his Opinion, the judgment under appeal clearly sets out the reasons why the General Court endorsed the Commission’s assessment regarding the distortion of competition test.", "63", "As the reasoning adopted therefore enabled, as required by the Court’s established case law, the interested parties to know the grounds upon which the General Court relied and provided the Court with sufficient material for it to exercise its powers of review on appeal, the complaint alleging that the judgment under appeal fails to state adequate reasons must be rejected.", "64", "Second, it should be recalled that the Commission is required, not to establish that aid has a real effect on trade between Member States and that competition is actually being distorted, but only to examine whether the aid is liable to affect such trade and distort competition (judgment of 8 September 2011, Commission v Netherlands, C‑279/08 P, EU:C:2011:551, paragraph 13 and the case-law cited).", "65", "In that regard, the fact that an economic sector has been the subject of liberalisation at EU level may serve to determine that the aid in question has a real or potential effect on competition and affects trade between Member States (judgment of 30 April 2009, Commission v Italy and Wam, C‑494/06 P, EU:C:2009:272, paragraph 53 and the case-law cited).", "66", "With regard to the requirement that competition should be distorted, it must be borne in mind in that regard that, in principle, aid intended to release an undertaking from costs which it would normally have to bear in its day-to-day management or normal activities distorts the conditions of competition (judgment of 30 April 2009, Commission v Italy and Wam, C‑494/06 P, EU:C:2009:272, paragraph 54 and the case-law cited).", "67", "In the present case, the General Court found, in paragraph 61 of the judgment under appeal, that it is apparent from recitals 114 to 116 of the decision at issue that the 1996 Law made and makes available to Orange greater financial resources to operate on the markets on which it is active, that the telecommunications services market on which Orange operated and operates throughout France and in other Member States was gradually opened up to competition and that those two factors enabled it to develop more easily on the markets of other Member States newly opened up to competition.", "68", "Bearing in mind those findings, which are not challenged by Orange, the General Court was entitled, without erring in law, to endorse the Commission’s assessment that the contested measure was liable to distort competition.", "69", "In the light of the foregoing considerations, the third part of the first ground of appeal and, therefore, that ground in its entirety must be rejected.", "The second ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court erred in law in its assessment as to whether the contested measure was compatible with the internal market", "First part of the second ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court distorted the facts and failed to have regard to its duty to state reasons in its assessment of the purpose of the exceptional flat-rate contribution", "– Arguments of the parties", "70", "Orange contends that the General Court distorted the facts before it and failed to have regard to its duty to state reasons when it held, in paragraphs 93 and 94 of the judgment under appeal, that the wording of the 1996 Law did not militate against the Commission’s interpretation that the exceptional flat-rate contribution was not a social security cost, but pursued other objectives, and that, accordingly, the Commission had not erred in law in taking the view that the fact that the non-common risks were not taken into account in the employer’s contribution in full discharge of liabilities could not be compensated for by that contribution.", "71", "Orange maintains that, contrary to the General Court’s assertion, the exceptional flat-rate contribution was a social security cost for Orange as Article 30 of the 1996 Law provided that it was to be paid ‘in return for the payment and servicing by the State of the pensions granted to its civil servant staff’.", "72", "The Commission disputes Orange’s arguments.", "– Findings of the Court", "73", "The General Court stated, in paragraphs 93 and 94 of the judgment under appeal, that the wording of the 1996 Law did not militate against the Commission’s interpretation that the exceptional flat-rate contribution was not a social security cost like the employer’s contribution in full discharge of liabilities, but pursued other objectives, deducing from this that the Commission had not erred in law or exceeded the bounds of its discretion by taking the view that the fact that the non-common risks had not been taken into account in the employer’s contribution in full discharge of liabilities could not be compensated for by the flat-rate exceptional contribution.", "74", "That assessment is based on the finding in paragraph 92 of that judgment that ‘it is apparent from a reading of subparagraph (c) in conjunction with subparagraph (d) of Article 30 of the 1990 Law, as amended by the 1996 Law, that the employer’s contribution in full discharge of liabilities was designed “to equalise the levels of wage-based social security contributions and tax payments” between France Télécom and its competitors, whereas those provisions were silent as to the purpose of the exceptional flat-rate contribution’.", "75", "Accordingly, first, as the Advocate General observed in point 86 of his Opinion, the judgment under appeal sets out clearly the reasons why the General Court rejected Orange’s claims.", "76", "As the reasons given therefore enabled, in accordance with the Court’s established case-law, the interested parties to know the grounds upon which the General Court relied and provided the Court with sufficient material for it to exercise its powers of review on appeal, the complaint alleging that the judgment under appeal failed to give adequate reasons must be rejected.", "77", "Second, as the Advocate General observed in point 85 of his Opinion, the argument summarised in paragraph 71 above cannot invalidate the finding set out in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal.", "Accordingly, it is clear that the distortion alleged is not manifestly apparent from the documents before the Court, and that, by its arguments, Orange is in fact asking the Court to carry out a fresh assessment of the facts and evidence, which falls outside the Court’s jurisdiction.", "78", "It follows that the argument alleging that the 1996 Law was distorted must be rejected as manifestly unfounded.", "79", "The first part of the second ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.", "The second part of the second ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court failed to have regard to its duty to state reasons in its assessment of the ‘La Poste precedent’", "– Arguments of the parties", "80", "By the second part of the second ground of appeal, Orange contends that the General Court failed to have regard to its duty to state reasons in that it went no further, in paragraphs 99 to 101 of the judgment under appeal, than to adopt the assessments of the Commission, and did not analyse the arguments put forward by Orange to demonstrate that those assessments were incorrect.", "Furthermore, it is said that the General Court did not examine the other arguments put forward by Orange with a view to demonstrating that the Commission was not justified in treating the reform of the pensions of civil servants working for France Télécom differently from that of civil servants working for La Poste.", "81", "The Commission disputes Orange’s arguments.", "– Findings of the Court", "82", "As the Advocate General noted in points 90 to 93 of his Opinion, the observations made by the General Court in paragraphs 99 to 101 of the judgment under appeal were made purely for the sake of completeness.", "Therefore, the arguments put forward by Orange in the appeal are ineffective as, even if they were well founded, they could not result in the judgment under appeal being set aside.", "83", "It follows that the second part of the second ground of appeal and, therefore, that ground in its entirety must be dismissed as wholly unfounded.", "The third ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court erred in law in its assessment of the period during which the aid was neutralised by the exceptional flat-rate contribution", "Arguments of the parties", "84", "Orange maintains that the General Court distorted the facts and made a substitution of grounds in holding, in paragraphs 107 and 108 of the judgment under appeal, that the elimination of the compensation and over-compensation charges formed part of the aid defined in Article 1 of the [decision at issue], in spite of the fact that, in recital 119 of that decision, the Commission merely concluded that that aid consisted in the reduction of the compensation in the form of the employer’s contribution, with no mention of the compensation and over-compensation charges.", "85", "Orange adds that compensation and over-compensation charges are normally borne by pension funds alone, not directly by undertakings.", "The General Court was not entitled to conclude that the arrangements introduced by the 1990 Law consisted of normal costs and that the 1996 Law therefore relieved the undertaking of costs normally borne by its budget.", "86", "The Commission disputes Orange’s arguments.", "Findings of the Court", "87", "The General Court stated, in paragraph 107 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘regrettably, recital 119 of the [decision at issue], which contains the conclusion on the existence of aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, was limited to stating that the aid consisted in the reduction of “the compensation consisting of the employer’s contribution”, without mentioning the compensation or over-compensation charges’.", "88", "Nevertheless, the General Court observed, in paragraph 108 of that judgment, that ‘it is apparent both from the background to the [decision at issue] and from Article 1 of that decision that the aid consists, in the Commission’s view, in the reduction of the compensation previously paid by the applicant, which necessarily includes all charges borne by the applicant before the contested measure came into force’.", "89", "That finding was based on the following considerations, to be found in paragraphs 104 to 106 of the judgment under appeal:", "‘104", "In the present case, it should be noted that State aid is defined in Article 1 of the [decision at issue] as aid “resulting from the reduction of the compensation to be paid to the State for the payment and servicing of the pensions granted, pursuant to the Civilian and Military Retirement Pensions Code, to the civil servants of France Télécom pursuant to [the 1996 Law] amending [the 1990 Law]”.", "105", "In recital 105 of the [decision at issue], the Commission explains that the amount of aid in question may be calculated as “the annual difference between the contribution in full discharge of liabilities paid by France Télécom to the State and the costs that it would have paid pursuant to the 1990 Law, indicated in Table No 1, if these had remained unchanged, after deducting the total flat-rate contribution paid in 1997”.", "It is apparent from Table No 1 in recital 18 of the [decision at issue] that the compensation and over-compensation charges are included in the charges paid by the applicant to the State between 1991 and 1996.", "106", "The Commission therefore indicated that the compensation and over-compensation charges were included in the calculation of the contribution paid pursuant to the 1990 Law and that the State aid was defined and calculated as the reduction in that contribution made by the 1996 Law.’", "90", "Thus, it is clear that, following that line of reasoning, the General Court did not substitute its own grounds for those in the decision at issue but simply interpreted that decision in the light of its actual content.", "Furthermore, contrary to what is claimed by Orange, that interpretation faithfully reflects the inconsistencies in that decision without distorting them.", "91", "Accordingly, the third ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "92", "Having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the appeal must be dismissed.", "Costs", "93", "Under Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs.", "94", "Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which apply to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "95", "Since Orange has been unsuccessful and the Commission has applied for costs, Orange must be ordered

at issue], the Commission took the view, in particular, that it was necessary to examine the question, whether, in essence by accepting the proposed arrangement and therefore the remission of 65% of its claim, the local tax office had behaved towards the applicant like a private creditor in a market economy.", "The Commission stated in that regard that the position of that office as [Frucona Košice]’s creditor was unusually strong in so far as that office was in a legally and economically more advantageous position than [Frucona Košice]’s private creditors.", "The local tax office held more than 99% of all claims registered and was a separate creditor whose claims could be satisfied at any time during the bankruptcy procedure from the sale of the secured assets (recital 80 of the

83 of the [decision at issue], the Commission observed as follows:", "“In brief, the Slovak Republic submits that, in its view, the measure constitutes State aid.", "It acknowledged that, at the time

the private creditor test, and the sixth alleging disregard of the limits of the obligation to conduct a diligent and impartial investigation.", "9", "It is appropriate to examine, in the first place,

paragraphs 109 to 118 of the judgment under appeal, that the private creditor test may be usefully relied on by the recipient of the aid.", "11", "According to the Commission, that test concerns the subjective state of mind of the public body when taking the decision to adopt the measure in question.", "Therefore, whether or not to reveal its intentions at that time is a choice that constitutes a subjective right of the Member State in question and, accordingly, that right cannot be invoked by third parties.", "Moreover, only that Member State has at its disposal all the relevant evidence on the basis of which it formed its view at the time it took the decision to adopt the measure in question.", "It is, therefore, for the Member State to invoke the private creditor test and to provide the evidence required.", "12", "In the present case, as is clear from recitals 128 to 132 of the decision at issue, the Commission was in possession of evidence demonstrating that the Slovak Republic’s position was clear and consistent, both in response to the complaint and at the time the arrangement was approved: the Member State had always indicated that, in its view, this was a matter of State aid.", "13", "The Commission adds that, if it were correct to hold that the recipient of the aid can rely on the private creditor test, the General Court erred in law by not requiring Frucona Košice, like it would a Member State, to establish unequivocally and on the basis of objective and verifiable evidence that the measure implemented falls to be ascribed to that Member State acting as a private creditor.", "14", "By its fourth ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law in holding, in paragraph 247 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission cannot make a distinction, as regards the applicability of the private creditor test, based on the various alternatives to the measure in question.", "15", "As the application of the private creditor test is based on the evidence provided in order to establish its applicability, the error of the General Court lies in its decision that the application of that test is an abstract exercise aimed at reconstructing of its own motion the behaviour of the ideal, rational and fully informed hypothetical private creditor.", "16", "Accordingly, where it is clear that no information on a particular course of action was put before the public creditor, there is no sense in comparing the behaviour of that entity with a similarly positioned private creditor.", "That test is therefore inapplicable in the present case.", "17", "The Commission submits that, in the present case, it is undisputed that no comparison of the proposed arrangement and the tax execution procedure was made at the time, for the purposes of the private creditor test.", "Accordingly, the General Court should have ruled on whether recital 120 of the decision at issue did in fact contain the implied conclusion that the private creditor test was not applicable.", "18", "Frucona Košice contests the merits of the Commission’s arguments.", "Findings of the Court", "19", "According to the settled case-law of the Court, classification as ‘State aid’ within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU requires that all the conditions set out in that provision are fulilled.", "Thus, first, there must be intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient; fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (judgments of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraph 40, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 53).", "20", "The concept of ‘aid’ embraces not only positive benefits, such as subsidies, but also measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which, therefore, without being subsidies in the strict sense of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect (judgment of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 30).", "21", "However, the conditions which a measure must meet in order to be treated as ‘aid’ for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU are not met if the recipient undertaking could, in circumstances which correspond to normal market conditions, have obtained the same advantage as that which has been made available to it through State resources (judgment of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 70 and the case-law cited).", "22", "When a public creditor grants payment facilities in respect of a debt payable to it by an undertaking, that assessment is made by applying, in principle, the private creditor test (judgment of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 32).", "23", "Accordingly, the private creditor test is not an exception which applies only if a Member State so requests, when all the constituent elements of State aid incompatible with the common market, as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU, exist.", "In fact, that test, where applicable, is among the factors which the Commission is required to take into account for the purposes of establishing whether such aid exists (see, to that effect, judgments of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C‑124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 103, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 32).", "24", "As a result, where it appears that the private creditor test might be applicable, it is for the Commission to ask the Member State concerned to provide it with all the relevant information enabling it to determine whether the conditions for applying that test are satisfied (judgment of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 33).", "25", "In the first place, it is clear from that case-law of the Court that, when it appears that the private creditor test might be applicable, it is for the Commission to examine that possibility, irrespective of any request to that effect.", "26", "Accordingly, as the Advocate General noted in points 72 and 76 of his Opinion, nothing prevents the recipient of the aid from invoking the applicability of that test and, if the recipient does invoke that test, it falls to the Commission to assess whether the test needs to be applied and, if so, to assess its application.", "27", "In the second place, as regards the relevance of the subjective state of mind, it must be noted, as the Advocate General pointed out in point 74 of his Opinion, that the starting point for determining whether the private operator test is to be applied must be the economic nature of the Member State’s action, not how that Member State, subjectively speaking, thought it was acting or which alternative courses of action it considered before adopting the measure in question.", "28", "In any case, the private creditor test is intended to determine whether the recipient undertaking would manifestly not have obtained comparable facilities from a private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the public creditor that sought to recover sums due to it by a debtor in financial difficulty (judgment of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 72) and, accordingly, whether that undertaking could, in circumstances which correspond to normal market conditions, have obtained the same advantage as that which has been made available to it through State resources (judgment of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 70).", "29", "It follows from this that the assessment which the Commission is required, where appropriate, to carry out cannot be limited to just the options that the competent public authority actually took into consideration, but must necessarily cover all the options that a private creditor would reasonably have envisaged in such a situation.", "30", "As for the argument put forward by the Commission in the context of the fourth ground of appeal, it suffices to note that the General Court did not err in law when it stated, in paragraph 247 of the judgment under appeal, that, since the private creditor test was applicable as such, the Commission could not make a distinction, as regards the applicability of the test, based on the various alternatives to the measure at issue.", "31", "Accordingly, the second and fourth grounds of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "The first ground of appeal, alleging misinterpretation of the decision at issue", "Arguments of the parties", "32", "By its first ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court misinterpreted the decision at issue when it held, in paragraphs 101 to 104 of the judgment under appeal, that in the decision at issue the Commission had concluded that the private creditor test was applicable on the facts of the case.", "33", "Accordingly, the General Court was wrong to hold that it should be deduced from the last sentence of recital 80 of the decision at issue that the private creditor test was applicable in the present case.", "That misinterpretation becomes apparent upon reading the subsequent recitals in that decision: recital 81 is not concerned specifically with the conditions under which that test is applicable, recital 82 specifically sets out the position in relation to the applicability of the test, and recital 83, as well as recitals 128 to 132, address whether that test is applicable.", "34", "Frucona Košice contests the merits of the Commission’s arguments.", "Findings of the Court", "35", "First, it must be stated that the decision at issue does not expressly specify that the private creditor test is inapplicable in the present case.", "On the contrary, it applies that test and its conclusion, stated in recitals 139 and 140, that the measure at issue does constitute State aid, is explicitly based on its application.", "36", "Second, it must be noted that if the Commission had any doubt as to the applicability of the test, it should, as is clear from paragraph 24 of the present judgment, have asked the Slovak State for relevant information in that regard and carried out an overall assessment of that evidence (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C‑124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 86).", "However, the decision at issue makes no mention of such a request or such an assessment.", "37", "Lastly, it should be noted that the Commission applied the private creditor test after having stated, in paragraphs 84 and 86 of the decision at issue, that the recipient had claimed that acceptance of the proposed arrangement did not constitute State aid because the bankruptcy procedure would have been less favourable for the Slovak State.", "38", "In those circumstances, the first ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "The third ground of appeal, concerning the principles res judicata and ne ultra petita", "Arguments of the parties", "39", "The Commission claims that the General Court misapplied the principles res judicata and ne ultra petita when it held, in paragraphs 123 to 126 of the judgment under appeal, that the Court of Justice had implicitly but necessarily held, in its judgment of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission (C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32), that the private creditor test was applicable to the facts of the present case and that, therefore, to follow the Commission’s interpretation of the decision at issue would be to disregard the force of res judicata.", "40", "Frucona Košice contests the Commission’s arguments.", "Findings of the Court", "41", "As the third ground of appeal relates to reasoning that was included for the sake of completeness in support of the General Court’s decision that the private creditor test was applicable to the facts of the present case, and since the first, second and fourth grounds of appeal, which criticise the same decision of the General Court, have been rejected as unfounded,  the third ground of appeal must be rejected as ineffective.", "The fifth and sixth grounds of appeal, concerning the application of the private creditor test and the Commission’s obligation to carry out a diligent and impartial investigation", "Arguments of the parties", "42", "By its fifth ground of appeal, the Commission, in the first place, claims that the private creditor test implies that the subjective view of the public body must be established and compared with the subjective view a private creditor would have taken in the same circumstances.", "In this respect, it follows from the case-law of the Court that the only relevant evidence is the information which was available, and the developments which were foreseeable, at the time when the public body took the decision.", "43", "The Commission infers from this that it is for the Member State concerned to show that, in order to make its decision, it did in fact take into consideration such evidence and developments, which must be comparable to the information a private operator would have required before making the same decision.", "44", "According to the Commission, it follows from the Court’s case-law that the private creditor test does not encompass a private creditor who acts fortuitously, but only one who acts in full knowledge of the facts, since, according to that case-law, economic evaluations made after the advantage was conferred, a retrospective finding that the investment made by the Member State was actually profitable, or subsequent justifications for the course of action actually chosen, do not suffice.", "45", "That does not mean that interested parties cannot bring forward information or evidence that is helpful in enlightening the Commission — for example on the nature and subject matter of the measure, its context or the objective pursued.", "However, it is not for those parties to substitute their assessment for the one in fact made by the Member State at the time it took its decision, just as it is not for the Commission to presume to reconstruct of its own motion the behaviour of the ideal, rational and fully informed hypothetical private creditor.", "46", "The information provided to the Commission in addition to that relied upon by the Member State concerned may seek to show that, on the basis of the information which the Member State did in fact take into account, a private creditor would or would not have acted in the same way.", "That information cannot, however, seek to justify the decision taken by reference to information or evidence that was not in fact considered by the Member State concerned.", "47", "In the second place, the Commission claims that, when the General Court formulated its assessment criteria in paragraph 137 of the judgment under appeal, it failed to limit the Commission’s verification obligation to the relevant information available to it.", "This failing led the General Court to consider, in paragraph 201 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission should have sought to obtain additional information with a view to verifying and substantiating its conclusions drawn by way of inference from the administrative file.", "48", "In paragraph 201, the General Court created a new requirement that the Commission has to reconstruct the behaviour of the ideal, rational and fully informed hypothetical private creditor by seeking any ‘imaginable’ information and evidence, which goes against the very philosophy forming the basis of the private creditor test, namely an assessment of the subjective state of mind of the public authority at the time of its decision.", "49", "According to the Commission, paragraphs 137 and 180 to 213 of the judgment under appeal are thus based (i) on the flawed finding that the case-law of the Court of Justice required the Commission to carry out an objective and complete analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the bankruptcy procedure rather than an analysis based on the subjective situation of the public authority, and (ii) on an incorrect reading of the decision at issue to the effect that the institution had carried out such an analysis.", "50", "In the third place, the Commission submits that the decision at issue is based on the state of Frucona Košice’s assets on 17 June 2004 and that, according to the General Court, the Commission was right not to accept the methodology of the E report as far as the determination of the liquidation factors for those assets is concerned.", "However, as this was the only financial information available to the local tax authority when it decided to accept the proposed arrangement, the logical consequence of those findings of fact is that a private creditor with only that information at its disposal would not have entered into the arrangement.", "Indeed, if a private creditor had requested additional information, it would not have entered into the proposed arrangement.", "51", "The Commission maintains that, given that it was obliged to carry out its verification exclusively by means of the information and evidence actually in the hands of the public creditor, or generally available as common knowledge, the administrative file, in any event, properly supported its conclusion that a private creditor would not have agreed to the arrangement.", "Indeed, the General Court did not point to any additional evidence that would have been relevant at the time the decision was made and that the Commission had failed to take into consideration.", "52", "Accordingly, the General Court erred in law by holding, in paragraphs 186 and 235 of the judgment under appeal, that the evidence in the administrative file was not such as to substantiate, to the requisite legal standard and unequivocally, the conclusions drawn by the Commission for the purposes of the assessment, at SKK 435 million (approximately EUR 14.5 million), of the proceeds from the sale of the applicant’s assets upon bankruptcy.", "The Commission adds that the General Court does not identify what the standard of proof that the Commission should have provided might be nor whether it views that standard as being as high as establishing unequivocally what the proceeds would have been.", "53", "In the fourth place, the Commission claims that the errors of law that it noted also vitiated the General Court’s assessment of the duration of the bankruptcy procedure and of the tax execution procedure.", "Those assessments were based on the same wrong test and on the rejection of the Commission’s evaluation of the proceeds of the liquidation of Frucona Košice’s assets.", "54", "By its sixth ground of appeal the Commission claims that paragraphs 191 to 195 of the judgment under appeal can be interpreted as reproaching the Commission for breaching its obligation to conduct a diligent and impartial investigation.", "The Commission submits that if this interpretation is correct, the General Court has misinterpreted the scope of that obligation and has imposed an excessive burden on it.", "55", "In this connection, the Commission claims that, in paragraphs 187 and 191 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found that the Commission was right to reject the probative value of the E report and to therefore make inferences on the basis of the evidence put forward by Frucona Košice or not contested by it.", "It then decided to condemn the Commission for not having requested additional information intended to verify and substantiate the conclusions which it had drawn from that evidence, without explaining what kind of additional evidence the Commission could possibly have requested.", "56", "The Commission based its assessment on the evidence it had available to it at that time and took the view that it could refer to the amount established by the beneficiary, relied on by the tax office and based on independent reports, without requiring the production of other reports.", "In any event, a public creditor would not have accepted an insufficiently substantiated estimate from its debtor of the value of the assets it offered as collateral for the deferral of the tax debt.", "In the present case, the local tax authority had at its disposal its own conclusions on the value of those assets, as was clear from the decision to defer the debt.", "57", "Frucona Košice contests the Commission’s arguments.", "Findings of the Court", "58", "As a preliminary point, it must be noted that the fifth and sixth grounds of appeal, in essence, relate to the extent of the Commission’s investigation obligations when carrying out a private creditor test assessments, as held by the General Court during its examination of the parts of the decision at issue relating to the bankruptcy procedure and the tax execution procedure.", "59", "In accordance with the Court’s settled case-law, when applying the private creditor test, the Commission must carry out an overall assessment, taking into account all relevant evidence in the case enabling it to determine whether the recipient company would manifestly not have obtained comparable facilities from such a private creditor (see, to that effect, judgments of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 73, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 47).", "60", "In that regard, all information liable to have a significant influence on the decision-making process of a normally prudent and diligent private creditor, who is in a situation as close as possible to that of the public creditor and is seeking to recover sums due to it by a debtor experiencing difficulty in making the payments, must be regarded as being relevant (judgments of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 78, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 54).", "61", "Moreover, for the purposes of applying the private creditor test, the only relevant evidence is the information which was available, and the developments which were foreseeable, at the time when the decision was taken (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C‑124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 105).", "62", "Such an examination by the Commission of whether particular measures can be classified as State aid because the public authorities did not act in the same way as a private creditor requires a complex economic assessment (judgments of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 74, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 48).", "63", "In this connection, it must be observed that, in the context of a review by the Courts of the European Union of complex economic assessments made by the Commission in the field of State aid, it is not for those Courts to substitute their own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgments of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 75, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 49).", "64", "However, the Courts of the European Union must, inter alia, establish not only whether the evidence relied on is factually accurate, reliable and consistent but also whether that evidence contains all the relevant information which must be taken into account in order to assess a complex situation and whether it is capable of substantiating the conclusions drawn from it (judgments of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 76, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 50).", "65", "In the present case, it is necessary to examine, in the first place, the arguments put forward by the Commission in the context of the fifth and sixth grounds of appeal directed against the part of the judgment under appeal relating to the bankruptcy procedure.", "66", "In this respect, first, it is necessary to reject the Commission’s arguments alleging that the subjective state of mind of the competent public body must first be determined and that the attitude of that body must then be compared with that of a hypothetical private creditor: the relevance of such reasoning has already been rejected in the context of the examination of the second and fourth grounds of appeal in so far as that reasoning is based on an incorrect assessment of the private creditor test.", "67", "Second, in so far as the Commission criticises the General Court for having created, inter alia by failing to limit the Commission’s verification obligation to the evidence available to it, a new requirement imposing on it the excessive burden of having to seek all ‘imaginable’ evidence and information, it is clear that the Commission’s argument is based on an incorrect reading of the judgment under appeal.", "68", "In this respect, it must, first of all, be noted that the General Court indicated, inter alia in paragraphs 134 to 137 of the judgment under appeal, that the assessment of the private creditor test must be made in relation to a situation as close as possible to that of the public authority in question.", "69", "Next, the General Court set out, in paragraphs 138 to 143 of the judgment under appeal, the principles that in its view govern the burden of proof on the Commission and, in that context, pointed out the evidence that the institution must, where appropriate, obtain and take into consideration in its examination, as well as the general limits of its investigatory obligations, as identified by the case-law of the Courts of the European Union.", "70", "In this connection, it should also be borne in mind that the lawfulness of a decision concerning State aid falls to be assessed by the European Union judicature in the light of the information available to the Commission at the time when the decision was adopted (judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 91 and the case-law cited).", "71", "However, the information ‘available’ to the Commission includes that which seemed relevant to the assessment to be carried out in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraphs 59 to 61 of the present judgment and which could have been obtained, upon request by the Commission, during the administrative procedure.", "72", "Lastly, in paragraphs 171 to 178 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that, according to its case-law, the Commission is in no way subject to a general obligation to commission outside consultants, and on this ground rejected Frucona Košice’s claims that the institution should have obtained new reports by external experts.", "73", "Paragraphs 180 to 213 and 235 of the judgment under appeal, against which the Commission’s objections referred to in paragraph 64 of the present judgment are directed, when read in the legal context referred to by the General Court, do not imply new requirements that are incompatible with the case-law of the Court of Justice.", "74", "Thus, the factual findings made in paragraph 185 of the judgment under appeal — that the Commission had determined the liquidation factors by way of inference from the evidence in the administrative file, had not carried out any methodological or economic analysis and had not requested additional information intended to verify and substantiate the conclusions which it had drawn from that evidence — cannot be read as containing a requirement that goes beyond those demanded by the principles noted by the General Court in paragraphs 138 to 143 of the judgment under appeal or that would be incompatible with those set out in paragraphs 59 and 60 of the present judgment.", "75", "Concerning the General Court’s findings of fact in paragraphs 186, 196, 200 and 201 of the judgment under appeal — that the evidence on the administrative file did not substantiate to the requisite legal standard the Commission’s assessment of the liquidation factors and that, accordingly, it should have sought to obtain additional information in order to substantiate its conclusions — these assessments in no way exceed the limits of judicial review of a manifest error of assessment which is to be carried out by the General Court in accordance with the case-law noted in paragraph 64 of the present judgment, and cannot be considered to introduce a requirement that would be incompatible with the principles set out in paragraphs 59 and 60 of the present judgment.", "76", "To the extent that the General Court held, in paragraph 186 of the judgment under appeal, that the evidence on the administrative file must substantiate the conclusions drawn by the Commission not only to the requisite legal standard but also unequivocally, it suffices to note that it is clear from paragraphs 187 to 201 of the judgment under appeal that, in any case, the General Court did not carry out its assessment by reference to such a requirement and did not allude to it in the context of its considerations in paragraphs 196, 200, 201 and 235 of the judgment under appeal.", "77", "As the Advocate General noted in paragraphs 125 and 131 of his Opinion, the General Court merely noted, in paragraphs 191 to 195, 198 and 199 of the judgment under appeal, the internal contradictions of the decision at issue and made findings of fact according to which none of the evidence on the administrative file was able to substantiate the liquidation factors used by the Commission.", "78", "Accordingly, contrary to the Commission’s submissions, the General Court did not apply an incorrect legal test.", "It follows that the Commission’s claims must be rejected as, in part, ineffective and, in part, unfounded.", "79", "In the second place, in so far as the Commission claims that the errors of law which it identified also vitiated the General Court’s assessment of the length of the bankruptcy procedure, in paragraphs 223 to 235 of the judgment under appeal, as well as its assessment of the tax execution procedure, in paragraphs 277 to 284 of that judgment, it is sufficient to state that, since an examination of the Commission’s claims has not led to a finding of an error of law, that line of argument is wholly unfounded.", "80", "Moreover, in paragraphs 279, 282 and 283 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found that the Commission had failed, first, to obtain information on the anticipated duration of a tax execution procedure, second, to take into account that it was likely to be interrupted by the initiation of the bankruptcy procedure and, third, to obtain information concerning the costs that such a procedure might generate.", "81", "Such considerations, in so far as they concern the information that a normally prudent and diligent private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the local tax office could not a priori ignore, are capable, in themselves, of justifying the General Court’s decision that the Commission failed to take into consideration all the relevant information (see, to that effect, judgment of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraphs 77, 78 and 81).", "82", "Furthermore, it follows from paragraphs 69 to 84 of the present judgment that, contrary to the Commission’s claim, it is apparent from the judgment under appeal that the General Court did explain, to the requisite legal standard, first, the extent of the Commission’s investigation obligations and, second, the kind of additional evidence the Commission could have requested.", "83", "Accordingly, the fifth and sixth grounds of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "84", "Since all the grounds of appeal put forward by the Commission in support of the present appeal must be rejected, the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.", "Costs", "85", "Under Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to the costs.", "86", "Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which applies to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "87", "Since the Commission has been unsuccessful and Frucona Košice has applied for costs, the Commission must be ordered to

EC was adopted in 2002.", "5", "Article 36 of Law No 46-628 established the principle of transferring to EDF the nationalised electricity concessions.", "In 1958, the various electricity transmission concessions granted by the State were converted into a single concession known as the ‘réseau d’alimentation générale’ (RAG) (high-voltage transmission network).", "6", "The application to EDF of the General Accounting Plan of 1982, which included accounting rules specific to concessions, led to consideration being given from 1987 onwards to the specific constraints which must be faced by concessionaires, who are bound by the obligation to return assets under concession in good working order when the concession ends, in accordance with the ‘principle of the sustainability of public services’.", "7", "Pursuant to the 1982 General Accounting Plan, an accounting plan specific to EDF was introduced and approved by the Interministerial Order of 21 December 1986 (JORF of 30 December 1986, p. 15794).", "8", "Pursuant to that specific accounting plan, the RAG was entered in the assets on EDF’s balance sheet under the item ‘Fixed assets under concession’ and specific provisions in respect of the renovation of the fixed assets under concession, which were intended to enable the concessionaire to return those assets to the grantor in perfect condition at the end of the concession, were created between 1987 and 1996.", "9", "Expenditure incurred by EDF as a result of renewal was recorded in the balance sheet item entitled ‘Counter-value of the assets in kind under

concession.", "10", "In 1994, the French Cour des comptes (Court of Auditors) held that the legal and financial regime governing the RAG was irregular and that, in consequence, the accounting plan was irregular, too.", "The French State accordingly undertook to clarify the legal and financial regime governing the RAG and to restructure EDF’s balance sheet.", "11", "The ‘1997-2000 State-EDF’ management contract, signed on 8 April 1997, provided for the normalisation of EDF’s accounts and of its financial relationship with the State, with a view to the opening up of the market in

20).", "It was with those circumstances in mind that Law No 97-1026 was adopted.", "12", "Prior to the adoption of that law, EDF’s balance sheet was presented as follows:", "—", "on the assets side, an item entitled ‘Fixed assets under concession’ in the amount of FRF 285.7 billion, of which approximately FRF 90 billion was for the RAG;", "—", "on the liabilities side, an item entitled ‘Provisions’ with approximately FRF 38.5 billion set aside for the RAG, and an item entitled ‘Counter-value of the assets in kind under concession’ recording the expenditure incurred for renovation.", "That item amounted to FRF 145.2 billon, of which FRF 18.3 billion was for the RAG.", "13", "Pursuant to Article 4 of Law No 97-1026, the way in which to restructure the upper part of EDF’s balance sheet was communicated to EDF, on 22 December 1997, by letter of the Minister for Economic Affairs, Finance and Industry, the State Secretary for the Budget and the State Secretary for Industry and, in particular, by Annex 1 thereto.", "The tax consequences of that restructuring were set out in Annex 3 to that letter.", "In paragraph 34 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court summarised as follows the transactions carried out in the context of the restructuring:", "—", "first, the assets constituting the RAG were reclassified, in the amount of FRF 90.325 billion, as ‘own assets’ and accordingly ceased to be classified as ‘assets under concession’;", "—", "secondly, the unused provisions for renewal of the RAG, in the amount of FRF 38.521 billion, were posted as retained earnings without flowing through the profit and loss account and were reclassified in the amount of FRF 20.225 billion as accumulated losses, that account being thereby reconciled and the balance of FRF 18.296 billion being allocated to the reserves.", "Although not flowing through the profit and loss account, those reclassifications resulted in the posting of taxable revenue, which was taxed at the rate of 41.66% pursuant to Article 38(2) of the General Tax Code;", "—", "thirdly, the ‘grantor rights’ were allocated directly to the capital injections item in the amount of FRF 14.119 billion (of a total of FRF 18.345 billion) without flowing through the profit and loss account, with the balance being recorded in various revaluation accounts.", "The administrative procedure and the contested decision", "14", "By letters of 10 July and 27 November 2001, the Commission asked the French authorities to provide certain information on a number of measures taken in respect of EDF which might involve State aid.", "15", "The subsequent exchange of correspondence included a letter of 9 April 2002 to the Commission from the French authorities, appended to which was an undated memorandum of the Directorate-General for Taxation of the French Ministry of Economic Affairs, Finance and Industry, in which it was stated, inter alia, that:", "‘The grantor rights in respect of the RAG represent an unowed debt which was unjustifiably exempted from tax by being incorporated into the capital.", "Those provisions were incorporated into the capital without any tax being incurred, since the RAG did not fall within the fiscal and accounting arrangements governing concessions.", "Since the RAG constituted own assets, EDF had no debt obligation towards the State to return those assets, with the result that the corresponding amounts posted in the item ‘[G]rantor rights’ constitute not actual liabilities, but a non-tax-exempt reserve.", "Under those circumstances, before that reserve was incorporated into the capital, it should have been transferred from the enterprise’s liabilities, where it was incorrectly posted, to a net assets account, thereby resulting in a positive variation in net worth that was taxable under Article 38[(2)], referred to above.", "The tax advantage thus obtained may be assessed at 5.88 [billion FRF] (14.119 x 41.66%) [or EUR 888.89 million, according to the conversion made by the Commission on the basis of the FRF/EUR exchange rate on 22 December 1997].’", "16", "By letter of 16 October 2002, published in the Official Journal of the European Communities of 16 November 2002 (OJ 2002 C 280, p. 8), the Commission informed the French authorities that it had taken three related decisions concerning EDF.", "One of these was a decision adopted by the Commission under Article 88(2) EC, initiating a formal investigation into the advantage accruing as a result of the fact that EDF did not pay the corporation tax due on some of the accounting provisions created free of tax for the renewal of the RAG.", "17", "Further exchanges then took place between the French authorities and the Commission, including a letter of 9 December 2002 to the Commission from the French authorities, in which it is stated, inter alia, that:", "‘2.", "The restructuring of EDF’s accounts in 1997 can be regarded as an additional capital injection in an amount equivalent to the partial tax exemption, the aim of which was also to correct under-capitalisation.", "…", "Before 1997, the “RAG” grantor rights were already regarded as quasi-“own assets” in view of the special situation arising from the State’s dual role in relation to EDF: grantor of the concession and owner.", "It was tacitly accepted, in those circumstances, that the grantor rights did not constitute a debt actually owed by EDF to the State.", "Accordingly, when the balance sheet was restructured in 1997 — an exercise in which the Minister for Economic Affairs, Finance and Industry, the State Secretary for the Budget and the State Secretary for Industry participated — EDF and the State assigned the quasi-own assets to capital, and the question of corporation tax was left aside.", "With that in mind, it was thought that it would be more efficient and more neutral for the public authorities to allocate the grantor rights directly, and in their full amount, to own assets, rather than to carry out the equivalent transaction, which would have entailed:", "—", "assigning to capital a net amount after corporation tax;", "—", "requesting EDF to pay corporation tax in an amount equal to the variation in net worth;", "—", "making an additional capital injection in an amount equal to the tax paid.", "That additional injection was justified by EDF’s projected profits in 1997, which were in fact achieved during subsequent years.", "In comparable circumstances, a private investor in a market economy would have made such a capital injection.", "Moreover, it can be stated that the entries regarding the accounting provisions for the renewal of the RAG were rectified … also with a view to having the balance sheet structured more in accordance with undertakings in similar industrial sectors.’", "18", "On 16 December 2003, the Commission adopted the contested decision.", "19", "Article 3 of the contested decision states:", "‘The non-payment by EDF, in 1997, of corporation tax on some of the provisions created free of tax for the renewal of the RAG, corresponding to FRF 14.119 billion in grantor rights reclassified as capital injections, constitutes State aid that is incompatible with the common market.", "The aid involved in the non-payment of corporation tax amounts to EUR 888.89 million.’", "20", "Article 4 of the contested decision provides, in particular:", "‘France shall take all necessary measures to recover from EDF the aid referred to in Article 3 and unlawfully made available to it.’", "21", "As regards the tax concession allegedly received by EDF in 1997, the Commission found, in the grounds of that decision, inter alia, that:", "‘(88)", "The letter from the Minister for Economic Affairs setting out the tax implications of the restructuring of EDF’s balance sheet shows that the unused provisions for renewal of the RAG were subjected by the French authorities to corporation tax at 41.66%, the rate applicable in 1997.", "(89)", "On the other hand, pursuant to Article 4 of [Law] No 97-1026 of 10 November 1997, some of those provisions, namely the grantor rights, corresponding to renewal operations already carried out, were reclassified as capital injections amounting to FRF 14.119 billion without being subjected to corporation tax. … In a memorandum dated 9 April 2002 addressed … to the Commission, the French authorities … noted that “the tax concession thus obtained [by EDF in 1997] can be estimated at FRF 5.88 billion (14.119 x 41.66%)”, equivalent to EUR 888.89 million …", "…", "(91)", "The Commission takes the view that the grantor rights should have been taxed at the same time and at the same rate as the other accounting provisions created free of tax.", "This means that the FRF 14.119 billion in grantor rights should have been added to the FRF 38.5 billion in unused provisions and taxed at the rate of 41.66% applied by the French authorities to the restructuring of EDF’s balance sheet.", "By not paying all the corporation tax due when it restructured its balance sheet, EDF saved EUR 888.89 million.", "…", "(95)", "The French authorities claim, furthermore, that the restructuring of EDF’s accounts in 1997 can be regarded as a capital injection of an amount equivalent to the partial tax exemption: it was therefore an investment by them and not an aid measure. …", "(96)", "The Commission has to dismiss these arguments, since the private investor principle can be applied only in the context of the pursuit of an economic activity, not in the context of the exercise of regulatory powers.", "A public authority cannot use as an argument any economic benefits it could derive as the owner of an enterprise in order to justify aid granted in a discretionary manner by virtue of the prerogatives it enjoys as the tax authority in relation to the same enterprise.", "(97)", "While a Member State may act as a shareholder in addition to exercising its powers as a public authority, it must not combine its role as a State wielding public power with that of a shareholder.", "Allowing Member States to use their prerogatives as public authorities for the benefit of their investments in enterprises operating in markets that are open to competition would render the Community rules on State aid completely ineffective.", "Furthermore, while in accordance with Article 295 the Treaty is neutral as regards the system of capital ownership, the fact remains that public enterprises must be subject to the same rules as private enterprises.", "Public and private enterprises would no longer be granted equal treatment if the State were to use the prerogatives of public power for the benefit of the enterprises in which it is a shareholder.’", "22", "In paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court stated that, in view of the interest calculated pursuant to Article 4 of the contested decision, the total amount which EDF had been asked to refund amounted to EUR 1.217 billion and that EDF had repaid that sum to the French State.", "Procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal", "23", "By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 27 April 2004, EDF brought an action for the annulment of Articles 3 and 4 of the contested decision.", "24", "By document lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 17 August 2004, the French Republic sought leave to intervene in support of the form of order sought by EDF.", "By order of 20 September 2004, the President of the Third Chamber of the General Court granted the French Republic leave to intervene.", "25", "By document lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 3 March 2008, Iberdrola SA (‘Iberdrola’) sought leave to intervene in support of the form of order sought by the Commission.", "Since the application to intervene was made after the end of the six-week period prescribed in Article 115(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, Iberdrola was given permission, by order of 5 June 2008, to submit its observations in support of the Commission during the oral procedure.", "26", "In support of its action, EDF raised three main pleas in law and two subsidiary pleas.", "27", "The General Court confined its examination to the first main plea and the first three parts of the second main plea.", "By the judgment under appeal, it rejected the first plea and the first two parts of the second plea.", "However, the General Court upheld the third part of the second plea and, in consequence, annulled Articles 3 and 4 of the contested decision.", "28", "By the third part of the second plea in law, EDF claimed that the measures at issue should have been categorised as a capital injection and that the overall background against which they fell to be assessed was that of the clarification of the financial relationship between the French State and EDF.", "By implementing those measures, the French State acted like a prudent private investor operating in a market economy, a point which the Commission should have established by applying the private investor test.", "29", "The French Republic intervened in support of EDF, particularly in relation to the third part of EDF’s second plea in law.", "Iberdrola intervened in support of the Commission’s contentions concerning that part.", "30", "In paragraphs 233 to 237 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found that, in order to determine whether the Commission was required to use the private investor test for the purposes of analysing the investment made by the French State in EDF’s capital, it had to be established whether that action on the part of the French State constituted, in the light of its nature and object and account being taken of the objective pursued, an investment which could be made by a private investor, hence an action to be attributed to the State acting as an economic operator in the same way as a private operator, or whether it constituted action taken by the State acting as a public authority, thus precluding application of the private investor test.", "In particular, the General Court found that, in examining the measure at issue, it was inappropriate to focus solely on its form, since the use of legislation is not enough in itself to preclude the possibility that, through its intervention in the capital of an undertaking, the State is pursuing an economic objective which could also be pursued by a private investor.", "31", "In paragraphs 240 to 242 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court recalled that the ‘grantor rights’ were allocated directly, in the amount of FRF 14.119 billion, to the capital injections item without flowing through the profit and loss account.", "The General Court stated that the Commission had found that only the failure to tax those rights prior to the capital injection constituted State aid, all the parties agreeing that tax was payable on the amount of FRF 14.119 billion before it was recorded under the item ‘Capital injection’.", "32", "In paragraphs 243 to 245 of that judgment, the General Court found that, since the purpose of the measure in question was to restructure EDF’s balance sheet and to increase its own funds, it was not a tax measure per se, but an accounting measure with tax implications.", "On the other hand, the General Court noted that the Commission had examined only the tax implications of that measure and that the Commission had made clear that, because of the fiscal nature of the advantage which it had identified, it was not under a duty to take into consideration either the capital increase brought about or the private investor test, since a waiver of a tax claim — such as that at issue — stems from the exercise of public authority.", "33", "In paragraphs 247 to 250 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found that, in the light of the fact that the objective pursued by the measure in question was the recapitalisation of EDF, the mere fact that the claim at issue is fiscal in nature did not mean that the Commission could legitimately decline to apply the private investor test.", "According to the General Court, the Commission was under an obligation to ascertain the economic rationale for the investment in question by undertaking an assessment as to whether, in the same circumstances, a private investor would have invested a comparable amount in EDF.", "That obligation was incumbent upon the Commission, whatever the form in which the capital had been provided by the State.", "34", "In paragraphs 251 and 252 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court stated that the possibility cannot be ruled out that the form taken by an investment may give rise to differences in terms of the cost of raising the capital and in terms of the return on that capital, from which it could be concluded that a private investor would not have made such an investment.", "However, such a conclusion presupposes that an economic analysis has been carried out in the context of applying the private investor test.", "According to the General Court, an analysis of that nature was justified since, first, a capital increase may result from the incorporation of a claim held by a private shareholder against the undertaking in question and, secondly, it was possible to regard the use of legislation to that end as a necessary consequence of the fact that the rules governing EDF’s capital were themselves laid down by statute.", "35", "Accordingly, in paragraph 253 of that judgment, the General Court concluded that, in view of the need to assess the contested measure in its context, the Commission could not confine its examination to the tax implications alone, but had at the same time to examine the merits of the argument that the waiver of the tax claim as part of the restructuring of EDF’s balance sheet and increasing of EDF’s capital could satisfy the private investor test.", "36", "The General Court went on to reject, in paragraphs 254 to 259 of the judgment, the Commission’s argument that the private investor test could not be applied in the circumstances since the French State had exercised its prerogatives as a public authority by using legislation to waive payment of the tax claim.", "In that connection, the General Court found that, in the circumstances, the French State had not been under any obligation in its capacity as a public authority and that it was not a case of assessing certain costs which the State had incurred as a result of its obligations as a public authority.", "37", "In paragraphs 260 to 263 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the Commission’s argument that the private investor test could not be applied to the conversion into capital of a tax claim, since a private investor could never hold a tax claim against an undertaking, but only a civil or commercial claim.", "According to the General Court, the purpose of the private investor test is to establish whether, despite the fact that the State has at its disposal means which are not available to the private investor, the private investor would, in the same circumstances, have taken a comparable investment decision.", "It follows that neither the nature of the claim, nor the fact that a private investor cannot hold a tax claim, is of any relevance.", "38", "In paragraphs 264 to 277 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the Commission’s argument that a private investor would have had to pay tax in a comparable situation, thereby incurring higher costs, since, in order to provide EUR 100, a private investor would have actually had to raise EUR 141.66.", "39", "In that regard, the General Court first pointed out that EDF and the French Republic had argued — as did the Commission itself, in paragraph 51 of the decision initiating the formal investigation procedure mentioned in paragraph 16 above — that, under French tax law, the variation in net worth brought about by a capital increase through incorporation of a claim held against an undertaking by one of its shareholders is not to be taken into account when calculating corporation tax and that, consequently, that conversion of the claim into capital does not give rise to taxation having as the basis of its assessment the amount of that claim.", "40", "Secondly, the General Court found that there was a contradiction between the Commission’s argument and the advantage which the Commission had identified in the contested decision, since that argument leads to an examination of the overall cost borne by a private investor in order to invest FRF 14.119 billion whereas the reclassification of the grantor rights, in that amount, had not been regarded by the Commission as constituting aid.", "41", "Thirdly, the General Court found that the Commission’s argument was inconsistent, since the Commission acknowledged that it would have examined the additional capital injection of FRF 5.88 billion (an amount which the General Court mistakenly stated to be FRF 5.6 billion) if EDF had previously paid tax on that amount and if the French State had then returned that same amount to EDF, since the cost borne by the State could then — and only then — have been compared with the cost borne by a private investor.", "The General Court found, however, that in such circumstances the cost to the State would have been the same and the amount received by EDF would have been the same as the amount which EDF received as a result of the measure at issue.", "42", "Fourthly, the General Court found that, even if a private investor was indeed required to pay tax, the cost of a capital injection by means of the incorporation of a claim would, for such an investor, amount to FRF 5.88 billion and would consequently be identical to the cost borne in the circumstances by the French State.", "Moreover, only by applying the private investor test was it possible to determine whether there was any difference in cost.", "43", "Fifthly, the General Court found that, even if the cost of a recapitalisation operation in the amount of FRF 14.119 billion were FRF 0 to the French State and FRF 5.88 billion to a private investor, that difference in cost would not preclude application of the private investor test.", "44", "In paragraph 283 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the Commission’s argument that accepting application of the private investor test could have the effect of justifying any form of tax exemption implemented by Member States.", "In that regard, the General Court stated that, in the view of that court, it was not a case of a simple tax exemption granted to an undertaking, but rather the waiver of a tax claim in the context of a capital injection into an undertaking of which the State was sole shareholder, and also that it was not possible to prejudge the outcome of the application of that test, in the absence of which it would be pointless.", "Procedure before the Court", "45", "By document lodged at the Registry of the Court on 29 July 2010, the EFTA Surveillance Authority applied for leave to intervene in support of the form of order sought by the Commission.", "46", "By order of 2 September 2010, the President of the Court granted leave to intervene.", "Forms of order sought", "47", "The Commission claims that the Court should:", "—", "set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court annulled Articles 3 and 4 of the contested decision and ordered the Commission to pay its own costs and to bear those incurred by EDF;", "—", "reject the third part of the second plea in law raised by EDF at first instance;", "—", "refer the case back to the General Court for reconsideration; and", "—", "reserve the costs of the proceedings.", "48", "The EFTA Surveillance Authority claims that the Court should:", "—", "uphold the appeal and set aside the judgment under appeal; and", "—", "refer the case back to the General Court.", "49", "Iberdrola claims that the Court should:", "—", "uphold the appeal and set aside the judgment under appeal;", "—", "reject the third part of the second plea in law raised by EDF;", "—", "refer the case back to the General Court; and", "—", "order EDF to pay the costs, including those incurred by Iberdrola.", "50", "EDF and the French Republic contend that the Court should:", "—", "dismiss the appeal; and", "—", "order the Commission to pay the costs.", "The appeal", "51", "The Commission raises two grounds of appeal, alleging (i) distortion of the facts and (ii) an error of law in the interpretation of Article 87 EC and, more specifically, in the determination of the scope and content of the ‘prudent private investor in a market economy’ test.", "52", "It is appropriate to consider the second ground of appeal first.", "The second ground of appeal: error of law in the interpretation of Article 87 EC", "53", "The second ground of appeal is made up of four parts, which it is appropriate to examine together.", "Arguments of the parties", "54", "By the first part of the second ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law by relying on the objective pursued by the French State in order to determine whether the French State had acted as a shareholder or as a public authority.", "Article 87(1) EC draws no distinction between State intervention measures based on the objectives pursued.", "55", "The Commission submits that the intention of a Member State is not a criterion which enables a distinction to be made between intervention by the State acting as shareholder and intervention by the State acting as a public authority.", "According to the Commission, that criterion is subjective and lends itself to manipulation.", "56", "By the second part of the second ground of appeal, the Commission argues, first, that the General Court did not seek to establish whether the French State’s conduct was comparable with that of a private investor because, instead of focusing on the ‘short plan’ approach actually provided for under Law No 97-1026, the General Court focused on the ‘long plan’ approach which consisted in: (i) allocating an amount net of tax to the item ‘capital injection’; (ii) requesting payment by EDF of a tax corresponding to the variation in net worth; and (iii) making a further capital injection in an amount equal to the tax paid.", "57", "As it is, according to the Commission, the choice of one or other of those approaches is not irrelevant because, under the ‘long plan’, the State budget guaranteed transparency whereas, under the ‘short plan’ applied in the present case, the resources employed escaped all budgetary discipline.", "Accordingly, in breach of the principle of equality before tax, EDF enjoyed special treatment without any transparency whatsoever.", "58", "Secondly, the Commission claims that the General Court did not take account of the need to define a reference private investor, since case-law calls for the definition of a real basis for comparison existing in a market economy.", "According to the Commission, the Court of Justice has excluded from the scope of the private investor test situations in which there is no real operator with whose conduct that of the State can be compared.", "59", "Thirdly, the Commission submits that the conduct of the French State could not have been adopted by a private investor, since a private investor would have had to pay corporation tax and would not have been able to convert it into capital.", "Only the State, in its capacity as fiscal authority, could still have had the sum at issue at its disposal.", "As it is, the private investor test is intended as a means of determining whether a private investment could have been made in similar circumstances.", "60", "Fourthly, the Commission submits that, as conceived by the General Court, the yardstick of the private investor is designed to test all conduct on the part of the State solely by reference to profitability, which would enable public undertakings to benefit from the status of their owner.", "61", "By the third part of the second ground of appeal, the Commission submits that, since account was taken only of the profitability angle and given that the State is able to wield its public powers, the analysis made by the General Court is inconsistent with the principle of equal treatment between public and private undertakings; it causes distortions to competition, contrary to Articles 295 EC and 87 EC; and it goes against the objective pursued by the private investor test.", "The private investor test would become a means of ensuring that certain measures which a private investor is unable to take could not be categorised as aid.", "62", "By the fourth branch of the second plea, the Commission claims, first, that the General Court disregarded the rules regarding the burden of proof.", "According to the Commission, where all the other conditions required to support a finding of State aid are met, it is for the Member State which is relying on the exception based on the private investor test to demonstrate that the conditions required for that exception to be accepted are met.", "63", "As it is, it is common ground, according to the Commission, that, during the administrative procedure, the French authorities simply relied on the projected profits without any data being produced to support their claims.", "Moreover, nothing in the file indicated that the French State considered the potential profitability of the tax exemption in question.", "In those circumstances, the Commission submits that it could not be required to examine the tax exemption in question in the light of that test.", "64", "Secondly, the Commission states that the legality of a decision concerning State aid must be assessed in the light of the information available to the Commission at the time when the decision was adopted.", "However, it follows from the foregoing that, at that time, the Commission had no evidence to suggest that the private investor test was relevant.", "65", "Iberdrola adopts the Commission’s arguments and adds, in relation to the first part of the second ground of appeal, that, by focusing on the objective pursued by the State, the General Court ignored the distinction between the State as shareholder and the State acting as a public authority.", "In that way, the inequality between the means available to a private operator and those available to the State went unremarked, because attention was fixed on the possible convergence of the objectives pursued.", "66", "Iberdrola states that no private operator has the power to define the conditions which determine tax liability and submits that, since an economic activity consists in offering goods or services on a given market, the exercise of fiscal power does not form part of an economic activity.", "Iberdrola adds that prohibiting a Member State from using its tax powers for the benefit of public undertakings does not give rise to discrimination, since the State can always make a capital contribution.", "67", "As regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, Iberdrola states that, if the French State had charged tax and then integrated it into its budget, it is not certain that the amount in question would have been contributed to EDF’s capital, since the procedures, controls and arbitration laid down for the implementation of a decision on such a contribution would have been different from those giving rise to the tax exemption in question.", "68", "As regards the third part of the second ground of appeal, Iberdrola submits that the separation of the activities of a shareholder from those resulting from the exercise of the State’s public power is intended to prevent a conflict of interests and to preserve equality of opportunity as between operators.", "However, the line of reasoning followed by the General Court would allow Member States to use their prerogatives to exempt public undertakings from certain obligations which are incumbent on private operators.", "69", "The EFTA Surveillance Authority adopts the arguments of the Commission and Iberdrola.", "So far as concerns the first part of the second ground of appeal, it argues that, even if it were possible to determine with certainty the intentions of the State, they should not be taken into account.", "It is necessary to determine, on the basis of objective and verifiable criteria, whether the State acted as a public authority or as a private investor.", "70", "The EFTA Surveillance Authority argues that, just as the State collects tax through the exercise of public authority, that is the framework within which tax debts are waived.", "Such conduct on the part of the State cannot be compared with that of a private investor.", "71", "As regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the EFTA Surveillance Authority states that the debt owed by EDF to the French State was not commercial or contractual, but a tax debt.", "It argues that, instead of comparing notional, subjective conduct on the part of the French State with that of a notional private investor, the General Court should have compared the actual conduct of that State, not with that of a creditor, but with that of an investor existing on the market.", "72", "The EFTA Surveillance Authority states that the financial crisis has shown that, in that type of situation, it is necessary to use a test which is clear and easy to apply, based on objective factors which are amenable to review by the Courts.", "The approach adopted by the General Court does not meet that requirement.", "73", "As regards the fourth part of the second ground of appeal, the EFTA Surveillance Authority claims that the reversal of the burden of proof effected by the General Court puts the institutions responsible for monitoring State aid in a difficult position, since they are able to make their decisions only in the light of the information available to them.", "The Commission could not apply the private investor test on its own initiative.", "74", "EDF and the French Republic contend that the second ground of appeal should be rejected.", "In particular, according to EDF and the French Republic, the General Court was right to find that the private investor test was applicable in the circumstances and, by failing to apply that test at the outset, the Commission acted in breach of its procedural obligations.", "Findings of the Court", "75", "The Commission, the EFTA Surveillance Authority and Iberdrola claim, in essence, that, in examining whether the private investor test was applicable in the circumstances, the General Court took into account, for that purpose, the objective pursued by the French State when it adopted the contested measure; secondly, it confused the roles of the State as shareholder and the State exercising its powers of taxation; thirdly, it acted in breach of the principle of equal treatment as between public and private undertakings; and, fourthly, it infringed the rules regarding allocation of the burden of proof.", "76", "According to case-law, a measure granted through State resources which puts the recipient undertaking in a more favourable financial situation than that of its competitors and which, for that reason, distorts or threatens to distort competition and affects trade between Member States is not excluded outright from being categorised as ‘aid’ for the purposes of Article 87 EC because of the aims pursued by that State (see, to that effect, Case C-6/97 Italy v Commission [1999] ECR I-2981, paragraph 15; Case C-156/98 Germany v Commission [2000] ECR I-6857, paragraph 25 and the case-law cited; and Joined Cases C-71/09 P, C-73/09 P and C-76/09 P Comitato ‘Venezia vuole vivere’ and Others v Commission [2011] ECR I-4727, paragraph 94 and the case-law cited).", "77", "Article 87(1) EC does not distinguish between measures of State intervention by reference to their causes or their aims but defines them in relation to their effects (Comitato ‘Venezia vuole vivere’ and Others v Commission, paragraph 94 and the case-law cited).", "78", "However, it is also clear from settled case-law that the conditions which a measure must meet in order to be treated as ‘aid’ for the purposes of Article 87 EC are not met if the recipient public undertaking could, in circumstances which correspond to normal market conditions, obtain the same advantage as that which has been made available to it through State resources.", "In the case of public undertakings, that assessment is made by applying, in principle, the private investor test (see, to that effect, Case C-303/88 Italy v Commission [1991] ECR I-1433, paragraph 20; Case C-482/99 France v Commission [2002] ECR I-4397, paragraphs 68 to 70; and Comitato ‘Venezia vuole vivere’ and Others v Commission, paragraph 91 and the case-law cited).", "79", "In particular, it is clear from case-law that, in order to assess whether the same measure would have been adopted in normal market conditions by a private investor in a situation as close as possible to that of the State, only the benefits and obligations linked to the situation of the State as shareholder — to the exclusion of those linked to its situation as a public authority — are to be taken into account (see, to that effect, Case 234/84 Belgium v Commission [1986] ECR 2263, paragraph 14; Case 40/85 Belgium v Commission [1986] ECR 2321, paragraph 13; Joined Cases C-278/92 to C-280/92 Spain v Commission [1994] ECR I-4103, paragraph 22; and Case C-334/99 Germany v Commission [2003] ECR I-1139, paragraph 134).", "80", "It follows that the roles of the State as shareholder of an undertaking, on the one hand, and of the State acting as a public authority, on the other, must be distinguished , as has been correctly argued by the Commission, the EFTA Surveillance Authority and Iberdrola and as the General Court held in paragraphs 223 to 228 of the judgment under appeal.", "81", "The applicability of the private investor test ultimately depends, therefore, on the Member State concerned having conferred, in its capacity as shareholder and not in its capacity as public authority, an economic advantage on an undertaking belonging to it.", "82", "It follows that, if a Member State relies on that test during the administrative procedure, it must, where there is doubt, establish unequivocally and on the basis of objective and verifiable evidence that the measure implemented falls to be ascribed to the State acting as shareholder .", "83", "That evidence must show clearly that, before or at the same time as conferring the economic advantage (see, to that effect, France v Commission, paragraphs 71 and 72), the Member State concerned took the decision to make an investment, by means of the measure actually implemented, in the public undertaking.", "84", "In that regard, it may be necessary to produce evidence showing that the decision is based on economic evaluations comparable to those which, in the circumstances, a rational private investor in a situation as close as possible to that of the Member State would have had carried out, before making the investment, in order to determine its future profitability.", "85", "By contrast, for the purposes of showing that, before or at the same time as conferring the advantage, the Member State took that decision as a shareholder, it is not enough to rely on economic evaluations made after the advantage was conferred, on a retrospective finding that the investment made by the Member State concerned was actually profitable, or on subsequent justifications of the course of action actually chosen (see, to that effect, France v Commission, paragraphs 71 and 72).", "86", "If the Member State concerned provides the Commission with the requisite evidence, it is for the Commission to carry out a global assessment, taking into account — in addition to the evidence provided by that Member State — all other relevant evidence enabling it to determine whether the Member State took the measure in question in its capacity as shareholder or as a public authority .", "In particular, as the General Court held in paragraph 229 of the judgment under appeal, the nature and subject-matter of that measure are relevant in that regard, as is its context, the objective pursued and the rules to which the measure is subject.", "87", "Accordingly, in the circumstances of the case, the General Court was right to hold that the objective pursued by the French State could be taken into account, in the context of the requisite global assessment, for the purposes of determining whether the State had indeed acted in its capacity as shareholder and whether, as a consequence, the private investor test was applicable in the present case.", "88", "As regards the question whether the applicability of the private investor test could be ruled out in the present case simply because the means employed by the French State were fiscal, it should be recalled that, under Article 87(1) EC, any aid granted through State resources — in any form whatsoever — which, in terms of its effects, distorts or threatens to distort competition is incompatible with the common market in so far as it affects trade between Member States (see Case C-156/98 Germany v Commission, paragraph 25 and the case-law cited).", "89", "Moreover, it has been noted in paragraph 78 above that the private investor test is applied in order to determine whether, because of its effects, the economic advantage granted, in whatever form, through State resources to a public undertaking distorts or threatens to distort competition and affects trade between Member States .", "90", "The intention underlying Article 87(1) EC and the private investor test is thus to prevent the recipient public undertaking from being placed, by means of State resources, in a more favourable position than that of its competitors (see, to that effect, Case C-387/92 Banco Exterior de España [1994] ECR I-877, paragraph 14, and Case C-6/97 Italy v Commission, paragraph 16).", "91", "However, the financial situation of the recipient public undertaking depends not on the means used to place it at an advantage, however that may have been effected, but on the amount that the undertaking ultimately receives.", "Consequently, when considering whether the private investor test was applicable, the General Court did not err in law by focusing its analysis, not on the fiscal nature of the means employed by the French State, but on the improvement — with a view to the opening up of the electricity market — in EDF’s financial situation and on the effects of the measure in question on competition .", "92", "Accordingly, it follows from all of the foregoing that, in view of the objectives underlying Article 87(1) EC and the private investor test, an economic advantage must — even where it has been granted through fiscal means — be assessed inter alia in the light of the private investor test, if, on conclusion of the global assessment that may be required, it appears that, notwithstanding the fact that the means used were instruments of State power, the Member State concerned conferred that advantage in its capacity as shareholder of the undertaking belonging to it .", "93", "It follows that the finding made by the General Court in paragraph 250 of the judgment under appeal, to the effect that the obligation for the Commission to verify whether capital was provided by the State in circumstances which correspond to normal market conditions exists regardless of the way in which that capital was provided by the State, is not vitiated by an error of law.", "94", "As regards the argument, put forward by the Commission, the EFTA Surveillance Authority and Iberdrola, that a private investor would not have been able in comparable circumstances to make an investment such as that made by the French State, since it would have had to pay the tax and since only that State, as tax authority, could still have had at its disposal sums corresponding to that tax, it should be noted, first, that in respect of the accounting transaction in question, it is the private undertaking in EDF’s situation which would have had to pay the tax, not its shareholder.", "95", "In the present case, therefore, application of the private investor test would have made it possible to determine whether, in similar circumstances, a private shareholder would have subscribed, to an undertaking in a situation comparable with that of EDF, an amount equal to the tax due.", "96", "Secondly, as the General Court pointed out in paragraphs 275 and 276 of the judgment under appeal, the possibility that there might be a difference between the cost to the private investor and the cost to the State as investor does not preclude application of the private investor test.", "Rather, that test makes it possible to address precisely that point, that is to say, to establish, inter alia, that such a difference exists and to take it into account when assessing whether the conditions laid down by that test are met.", "97", "It follows that — contrary to the assertions made by the Commission, the EFTA Surveillance Authority and Iberdrola — the analysis carried out by the General Court is not inconsistent with the principle of equal treatment between public and private undertakings; it does not cause distortion of competition; and it does not go against the objective pursued by the private investor test.", "98", "Accordingly, in finding that the private investor test may be applicable even where fiscal means have been employed, the General Court did not err in law.", "99", "It should be added that, by the judgment under appeal, the General Court did not prejudge the applicability of that test to the present case; nor, as was noted in paragraph 283 of that judgment, did the General Court prejudge the outcome of applying that test.", "100", "In particular, by merely verifying whether the applicability of the private investor test could be ruled out simply because the means employed by the French State were fiscal, the General Court in no way adopted an analysis tantamount to authorising the Member States to take into account, when applying that test, the advantages and obligations linked to their status as a public authority or factors which are subjective and open to manipulation.", "101", "As to the question whether, in the present case, it was necessary to define a reference investor, it should be noted that the case-law relied upon in that regard by the Commission, the EFTA Surveillance Authority and Iberdrola concerns a situation marked by the impossibility of comparing the position of a public undertaking operating in a reserved sector with that of a private undertaking not operating in a reserved sector (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-83/01 P, C-93/01 P and C-94/01 P Chronopost and Others v Ufex and Others [2003] ECR I-6993, paragraph 38).", "102", "As it is, the argument put forward by the Commission, the EFTA Surveillance Authority and Iberdrola is not that it is impossible to compare EDF’s situation with that of a private undertaking operating in sectors identical to those in which EDF operates.", "Moreover, it follows from the same line of authority that, for the purposes of such a comparison, an assessment must be carried out by reference to the objective and verifiable evidence which is available.", "103", "Furthermore, contrary to the assertions made by the Commission and the EFTA Surveillance Authority, the private investor test is not an exception which applies only if a Member State so requests, in situations characterised by all the constituent elements of State aid incompatible with the common market, as laid down in Article 87(1) EC.", "It follows from paragraph 78 above that, where it is applicable, that test is among the factors which the Commission is required to take into account for the purposes of establishing the existence of such aid.", "104", "Consequently, where it appears that the private investor test could be applicable, the Commission is under a duty to ask the Member State concerned to provide it with all relevant information enabling it to determine whether the conditions governing the applicability and the application of that test are met, and it cannot refuse to examine that information unless the evidence produced has been established after the adoption of the decision to make the investment in question.", "105", "It has already been noted in paragraphs 83 to 85 above that, for the purposes of applying the private investor test, the only relevant evidence is the information which was available, and the developments which were foreseeable, at the time when the decision to make the investment was taken.", "That is especially so where, as in the present case, the Commission is seeking to determine whether there has been State aid in relation to an investment which was not notified to it and which, at the time when the Commission carries out its examination, has already been made by the Member State concerned.", "106", "In the light of all the foregoing, the second ground of appeal must be rejected.", "The first ground of appeal: distortion of the facts", "107", "The Commission submits, in essence, that the General Court distorted the evidence in finding that, by the measure at issue, the French Republic converted a tax claim into capital.", "The Commission claims that, by that measure, the French Republic granted EDF an exemption from corporation tax and that, in the case of a tax exemption, the private investor test is not relevant.", "108", "However, in the course of considering the second ground of appeal, it has been found that, where a Member State confers an economic advantage upon an undertaking belonging to it, the fiscal nature of the process used to grant that advantage does not mean that the applicability of the private investor test can automatically be ruled out.", "It follows, a fortiori, that the precise modus operandi chosen by the Member State is irrelevant for the purposes of assessing whether that test applies.", "109", "In those circumstances, even if it were established, the alleged distortion of the facts would not, in any event, be such as to affect the soundness of the judgment under appeal.", "It follows that the first ground of appeal must be rejected as ineffective.", "110", "It follows from all the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed.", "Costs", "111", "Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, which applies to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 118 thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "Since EDF has applied for costs against the Commission, which has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay the costs.", "112", "Pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 69(4) of those Rules of Procedure, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 118 thereof, the French Republic must bear its own costs.", "113", "Pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 69(4) of those Rules of Procedure, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 118 thereof, the EFTA Surveillance Authority must bear its own costs.", "114", "The third subparagraph of Article 69(4) of those Rules of Procedure, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 118 thereof, provides that the Court may order an intervening party to bear its own costs.", "It is appropriate to apply that provision in respect of Iberdrola.", "On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby:", "1.",

2015, Spain and Others v Commission (T‑515/13 and T‑719/13, the judgment under appeal, EU:T:2015:1004), by which the General Court annulled Commission Decision 2014/200/EU of 17 July 2013 on State aid SA.21233 C/11 (ex NN/11, ex CP 137/06) implemented by Spain — Tax scheme applicable to certain finance lease agreements, also known as the Spanish Tax Lease System (OJ 2014 L 144, p. 1,‘the decision at issue’).", "Background to the dispute", "2", "The background to the dispute, as set out in the judgment under appeal, are summarised below.", "3", "Following complaints about the fact that the Spanish tax lease system as applied to certain finance lease agreements for the purchase of ships (‘the STL system’) made it possible for shipping companies to purchase ships built by Spanish shipyards at a 20% to 30% rebate, the Commission initiated the formal examination procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU, by Decision C(2011) 4494 final of 29 June 2011 (OJ 2011 C 276, p. 5).", "4", "During that procedure, the Commission found that the STL system was used, until the date of that decision, in transactions involving the building by shipyards and the acquisition by maritime shipping companies of sea-going vessels and the financing of those transactions by means of an ad hoc legal and financial structure organised by a bank.", "The STL system involved, for each ship order, a shipping company, a shipyard, a bank, a leasing company, an Economic Interest Grouping (EIG) formed by the bank and investors who purchase shares in the EIG.", "The latter took a lease out on the ship from a leasing company as soon as construction began and in turn leased it to the shipping company under a bareboat charter.", "The EIG undertook to buy the vessel at the end of the leasing contract while the shipping company undertook to buy it at the end of the bareboat charter.", "According to the decision at issue, there was a tax planning scheme intended to generate tax benefits for investors in a tax transparent EIG and transfer part of those benefits to the shipping company in the form of a rebate on the price of the vessel.", "5", "The Commission found that the STL operations combined five measures provided for in a number of provisions of the Real Decreto Legislativo 4/2004, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley del Impuesto sobre Sociedades (Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004 approving the consolidated version of the Law on Corporation Tax) of 5 March 2004 (BOE No 61, of 11 March 2004, p. 10951, ‘the TRLIS’) and of Real Decreto 1777/2004, por el que se aprueba el Reglamento del Impuesto sobre Sociedades (Royal Decree 1777/2004 approving the Regulation on Corporation Tax) of 30 July 2004 (BOE No 189, of 6 August 2004, p. 37072, ‘the RIS’).", "Those measures were the accelerated depreciation of leased assets under Article 115(6) TRLIS, the discretionary application of early depreciation of leased assets under Articles 48(4) and 115(11) TRLIS and Article 49 RIS, the provisions relating to EIGs, the tonnage tax system under Articles 124 to 128 TRLIS and the provisions of Article 50(3) RIS.", "6", "Under Article 115(6) TRLIS, the accelerated depreciation of the leased asset started on the date on which that asset became operational, that is to say, not before the asset was delivered to and started being used by the lessee.", "However, pursuant to Article 115(11) TRLIS, the Ministry of Economic Affairs could, upon formal request by the lessee, determine an earlier starting date for depreciation.", "Article 115(11) TRLIS imposed two general conditions for early depreciation.", "The specific conditions applicable to EIGs were set out in Article 48(4) TRLIS.", "The authorisation procedure under Article 115(11) TRLIS was set out in Article 49 RIS.", "7", "The tonnage tax system was authorised in 2002 as State aid compatible with the internal market by virtue of the Community guidelines on State aid to maritime transport of 5 July 1997 (OJ 1997 C 205, p. 5), as amended on 17 January 2004 (OJ 2004 C 13, p. 3), by Commission Decision C(2002) 582 final of 27 February 2002 concerning State aid N 736/2001 implemented by Spain — Scheme for the tonnage based taxation of shipping companies (OJ 2004 C 38, p. 4).", "Under that system, undertakings entered in one of the registers of shipping companies which have obtained authorisation from the tax administration to that end are taxed, not on the basis of their profits and losses, but on the basis of tonnage.", "Spanish legislation enables EIGs to be entered in one of those registers, even though they are not shipping companies.", "8", "Article 125(2) TRLIS made provision for a special procedure for vessels already acquired at the time of entry into the tonnage tax system and used vessels acquired when the undertaking already benefited from that system.", "Under the normal application of that system, potential capital gains were taxed on entry into the TT system and it was assumed that the taxation of capital gains, even though it was delayed, took place later on when the vessel was sold or dismantled.", "However, by way of derogation from that provision, Article 50(3) RIS provided that, when vessels were acquired through a call option as part of a leasing contract previously approved by the tax authorities, those vessels were deemed to be new, and not used within the meaning of Article 125(2) TRLIS, without taking into consideration whether they had already been depreciated, so that any capital gains were not taxed.", "That exception, which was not notified to the Commission, was only applied to specific leasing contracts approved by the tax authorities in the context of applications for early depreciation pursuant to Article 115(11) TRLIS, that is to say, in relation to leased newly built vessels acquired through STL operations, and — with one exception — from Spanish shipyards.", "9", "By applying all of those measures, the EIG collected the tax benefits in two stages.", "In the first stage, early and accelerated depreciation of the leased vessel was applied under the ordinary corporate income tax system which generated heavy tax losses for the EIG which, because of the EIG’s tax transparency, were deductible from the investors’ own revenues pro rata to their shares in the EIG.", "While that early and accelerated depreciation of the cost of the vessel is usually offset later on by increased tax payments when the vessel is completely depreciated or when the vessel is sold resulting in a capital gain, the tax savings resulting from the initial losses transferred to the investors were then safeguarded, in the second stage, as a result of the EIG’s switchover to the tonnage tax system which allowed the full exemption of the capital gains resulting from the sale of the vessel to the shipping company.", "10", "Whilst it took the view that the STL scheme had to be characterised as a system, the Commission also examined each of the measures in question individually.", "By the decision at issue, the Commission decided that, among those measures, those resulting from Article 115(11) TRLIS, relating to early depreciation of leased assets, from the application of the tonnage tax scheme to non-eligible undertakings, vessels or activities and from Article 50(3) RIS (‘the tax measures at issue) constituted State aid to the EIGs and their investors, unlawfully put into effect by the Kingdom of Spain since 1 January 2002 in breach of Article 108(3) TFEU.", "It declared that the tax measures at issue were incompatible with the internal market, except to the extent that the aid corresponded to a remuneration in conformity with the market for the intermediation of financial investors and that it was channelled to maritime transport companies eligible under the Maritime Guidelines.", "It decided that the Kingdom of Spain had to put an end to that aid scheme in so far as it is incompatible with the internal market and had to recover the incompatible aid from the EIG investors who benefited from it without those recipients being able to transfer the burden of recovery to other persons.", "However, the Commission decided that no recovery would take place in respect of aid granted as part of financing operations in respect of which the competent national authorities had undertaken to grant the benefit of the measures by a legally binding act adopted before 30 April 2007, the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of Commission Decision 2007/256/EC of 20 December 2006 on the aid scheme implemented by France under Article 39 CA of the General Tax Code — State aid C 46/04 (ex NN 65/04) (OJ 2007 L 112, p. 41).", "The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal", "11", "By applications lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 25 September and 30 December 2013, first, the Kingdom of Spain and, secondly, Lico Leasing SA and Pequeños y Medianos Astilleros Sociedad de Reconversión SA (‘PYMAR’) brought an action for the annulment of the decision at issue.", "The two cases were joined for the purposes of the judgment.", "12", "In the judgment under appeal, the General Court annulled the decision at issue and ordered the Commission to pay the costs .", "Procedure before the Court of Justice and forms of order sought", "13", "By orders of the President of the Court of Justice of 21 December 2016, Bankia SA and 32 other entities (‘Bankia and Others’), and Aluminios Cortizo SAU were granted leave to intervene in support of the form of order sought by Lico Leasing and PYMAR.", "14", "By its appeal, the Commission claims that the Court of Justice should set aside the judgment under appeal, refer the case back to the General Court and order the applicants at first instance to pay the costs.", "15", "The Kingdom of Spain contends that the appeal should be dismissed as unfounded and that the Commission should be ordered to pay the costs.", "16", "Lico Leasing and PYMAR seek the dismissal of the appeal as inadmissible and, in the alternative, as unfounded, and request that the Commission be ordered to pay the costs.", "17", "Bankia and Others, and Aluminios Cortizo ask the Court of Justice to declare the appeal unfounded and to order the Commission to pay the costs.", "The appeal", "Admissibility", "18", "Lico Leasing and PYMAR express doubts as to the admissibility of the appeal which, in their opinion, is based on new claims concerning the identification of the beneficiaries of the economic advantages arising from the tax measures at issue, such as those by which the EIG and the investors formed an economic unit, and which were intended to address inconsistencies in the decision at issue.", "19", "However, it must be pointed out that those doubts do not relate to an aspect of the appeal which, as such, would affect its admissibility and that the admissibility of the claims at issue, even if they were proven, would affect only some of the arguments advanced by the Commission in support of its appeal concerning the identification of the beneficiaries of the economic advantages arising from the tax measures at issue.", "The admissibility of those claims will therefore be assessed in this judgment in the examination of the first part of the first ground of appeal.", "20", "It follows that the plea of inadmissibility raised by Lico Leasing and PYMAR must be rejected.", "The first ground of appeal", "21", "By its first ground of appeal, the Commission submits that errors of law were made in the interpretation and application of Article 107(1) TFEU as regards the terms ‘undertaking’ and ‘selective advantage’.", "First part of the first ground of appeal", "22", "In the first part of its first ground of appeal, the Commission claims, first of all, that the General Court committed an error of law in the identification of the beneficiaries of the aid and in relation to the terms ‘undertaking’, ‘advantage’ and ‘selective measure’.", "Next, it alleges that the General Court infringed Article 296 TFEU in holding that the decision at issue was, in that respect, vitiated by a failure to state reasons, and indeed by contradictory reasoning.", "That second complaint will be examined with the second ground of appeal.", "– Arguments of the parties", "23", "In support of the first complaint in the first part of its first ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law by carrying out an artificial assessment of the situation which was submitted to it and by confusing the economic term ‘undertaking’ with the term ‘taxpayer’.", "In paragraphs 116 to 118 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court wrongly considered that, as a result of the tax transparency of the EIGs, the tax advantages which they had been granted could benefit only their members.", "It is on the basis of that flawed premiss, which denies the existence of the EIGs, their capacity to benefit from any tax aid and the fact that they carried on an economic activity in a specific sector, that the General Court then based the entire judgment under appeal and stated that the tax measures at issue were general in nature and not selective, because the members of the EIGs could belong to any sector of the economy.", "The consequence of that reasoning is that any undertaking organised under the legal form of an EIG could benefit from tax advantages without those advantages being classified as ‘State aid’.", "24", "According to the Commission, the fact that any person may, in principle, be a member of an EIG does not transform in a general way a measure which clearly constitutes a derogation from the reference framework and which is granted only to undertakings active in a specific sector of activity.", "In the present case, the activity of the EIGs is limited to one sector of activity, that is to say, financing the acquisition of vessels through leasing contracts, their bareboat chartering and their subsequent sale, and the beneficiaries of the advantages examined in the decision at issue are the EIGs and their members taken together or, in other words, the single entity formed by each EIG and its members.", "25", "The Kingdom of Spain argues that, contrary to the Commission’s claims, the General Court did not interpret the term ‘undertaking’ or the term ‘taxpayer’ in the judgment under appeal.", "The appeal seeks to attribute to the EIGs the role of undertakings exercising a specific activity, even though that role has not been examined in the decision at issue, and it does not give any importance to the fact that the tax transparency involved the transfer of the tax advantages to the members of the EIGs, so that those members thus became the only genuine addressees of the tax measures at issue, as the decision at issue itself demonstrates.", "Ultimately, by accepting that the EIG is an ancillary instrument in the activity of its members, that it is the initial beneficiary of the tax advantages and that it passes those advantages on to its members who become the final beneficiaries, from whom the Commission has ordered the recovery of the aid, the Commission’s arguments lead to the same conclusions as those reached by the General Court.", "26", "Lico Leasing and PYMAR contend that the General Court did not err in the identification of the beneficiaries of the advantages resulting from the tax measures at issue, which constitutes a question of fact and not of law.", "In addition, it is undeniable that the EIGs cannot be regarded as the actual beneficiaries of the tax advantages resulting from the tax measures in question.", "The fact that a measure is applied by the EIGs which conduct a certain type of economic transaction does not mean that that measure is selective in nature, since the selectivity of an advantage, like all the other conditions for the existence of State aid, must be examined by reference to the operators in whose favour the economic advantage occurs.", "Consequently, in the present case, the condition relating to selectivity, which led to the conclusion that there were tax advantages available to all undertakings, must be examined by reference to the investors.", "27", "In addition, if the EIGs were regarded as the beneficiaries of those advantages, it would be difficult to identify the sector of economic activity affected.", "The market for the financing, chartering and sale of vessels, which is specific to the EIGs, does not exist, since the EIGs which participated in the STL system were mere financial instruments.", "28", "The Commission’s argument that the EIGs and the investors constituted an economic unit, apart from the fact that it was presented for the first time at the hearing before the General Court and that it involved the examination of a question of fact, distorts the meaning of the term ‘economic unit’ which implies an entity’s control over a company and the possibility of effectively intervening, directly or indirectly, in the management of that company.", "29", "Bankia and Others submit, in essence, that the Commission’s line of argument that the EIGs are the recipients of the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue is out of time and therefore inadmissible.", "By that line of argument, the Commission is now seeking to establish the selectivity of those measures by classifying the EIGs as beneficiaries and attributing to them a sectoral activity, even though, first, the EIGs neither received nor transferred a tax advantage, since those measures resulted only in losses for the EIGs, and, secondly, the economic sector in which they operated is not identified.", "30", "Aluminios Cortizo also submits that an EIG is merely a financial mechanism which cannot have the capacity of a beneficiary of aid and that, since any undertaking may be a member of an EIG, the condition relating to selectivity has not been satisfied with regard to the investors.", "Those investors do not form part of an economic group, since they are linked to each other only by a contract of association for the construction of a specific asset, and furthermore, there is no buying and selling or leasing activity constituting a market, since the operations carried out in the context of the STL system result merely from the performance of contractual obligations.", "The selectivity relied on may be assessed only on the shipbuilding market, which was, however, ruled out by the Commission.", "– Findings of the Court of Justice", "31", "Since Lico Leasing and PYMAR dispute the admissibility of the first complaint in the first part of the Commission’s first ground of appeal alleging an error of law in the identification of the beneficiaries of the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue on the ground that it is a question of fact, it is true that the assessment of facts and evidence does not constitute, save where the clear sense of the facts and evidence has been distorted, a question of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice in the context of an appeal.", "However, when the General Court has established or assessed the facts, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction under Article 256 TFEU to review the legal characterisation of those facts and the legal conclusions which have been drawn from them (judgments of 6 April 2006, General Motors v Commission, C‑551/03 P, EU:C:2006:229, paragraph 51; of 22 December 2008, British Aggregates v Commission, C‑487/06 P, EU:C:2008:757, paragraph 96, and of 20 December 2017, Comunidad Autónoma del País Vasco and Others v Commission, C‑66/16 P to C‑69/16 P, EU:C:2017:999, paragraph 97).", "32", "By that complaint, the Commission does not dispute the facts on which the General Court relied, but the inferences which it drew from them, in particular those drawn from the tax transparency of the EIGs, in order to hold that the investors — the members of the EIGs — and not the EIGs themselves, were the beneficiaries of the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue.", "In doing so, the Commission seeks a review of the General Court’s legal classification relating to the beneficiaries of those advantages, which falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice in the context of an appeal.", "That complaint is therefore admissible.", "33", "With regard to the Commission’s argument that the EIG and its members are part of an economic unit and are the beneficiaries of the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue, which Lico Leasing and PYMAR, and Bankia and Others claim is out of time, it must be pointed out that that argument was advanced before the General Court, as is apparent from paragraphs 167 and 168 of the judgment under appeal.", "Consequently, the pleas of inadmissibility raised against that argument are unfounded.", "34", "As regards the substance, it must be recalled that EU competition law and, in particular, the prohibition under Article 107(1) TFEU apply to the activities of undertakings.", "The term ‘undertaking’, in this context, covers any entity engaged in an economic activity, regardless of its legal status and the way in which it is financed.", "Any activity consisting in offering goods or services on a given market is an economic activity (see, to that effect, judgment of 27 June 2017, Congregación de Escuelas Pías Provincia Betania, C‑74/16, EU:C:2017:496, paragraphs 39, 41 and 45 and the case-law cited).", "35", "According to the settled case-law of the Court of Justice, classification of a national measure as ‘State aid’ for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU requires that all the conditions set out in that provision are fulfilled.", "First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources.", "Second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States.", "Third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient.", "Fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (judgments of 10 June 2010, Fallimento Traghetti del Mediterraneo, C‑140/09, EU:C:2010:335, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited; of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraph 40, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 53).", "36", "As regards the condition relating to the existence of a selective advantage, in accordance with settled case-law interventions which, in any form whatsoever, are liable to favour undertakings directly or indirectly, or which must be regarded as economic advantages which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions, are considered to be State aid.", "Thus, measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges that are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which therefore, without being subsidies in the strict meaning of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect are considered to constitute aid (judgment of 27 June 2017, Congregación de Escuelas Pías Provincia Betania, C‑74/16, EU:C:2017:496, paragraphs 65 and 66 and the case-law cited).", "Article 107(1) TFEU does not distinguish between measures of State intervention by reference to their causes or their aims, but defines them on the basis of their effects, and thus independently of the techniques used (see, to that effect, judgments of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 87, 92 and 93, and of 28 June 2018, Andres (liquidator in the insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission, C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505, paragraph 91).", "37", "As regards, in particular, national measures that confer a tax advantage, it must be recalled that a measure of that nature which, although not involving the transfer of State resources, places the recipients in a more favourable position than other taxpayers is capable of procuring a selective advantage for the recipients and, consequently, constitutes State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "On the other hand, a tax advantage resulting from a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators does not constitute such aid (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 72 and 73 and the case-law cited; see, also, judgments of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 56, and of 28 June 2018, Andres (liquidator in the insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission, C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505, paragraph 85).", "Similarly, the term ‘State aid’ does not refer to State measures which differentiate between undertakings and which are, therefore, prima facie selective where that differentiation arises from the nature or the overall structure of the system of which they form part (judgments of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraph 41, and of 28 June 2018, Andres (liquidator in the insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission, C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505, paragraph 87).", "38", "In the present case, in upholding the plea, raised by the Kingdom of Spain, and Lico Leasing and PYMAR, that the Commission had infringed Article 107(1) TFEU, in so far as the conditions relating to selectivity, the risk of distortion of competition and the effect on trade had not been fulfilled, since those conditions must be established, in their opinion, only with regard to the advantages obtained by the investors, the General Court, in paragraph 116 of the judgment under appeal, found that, although the EIGs had benefited from the three tax measures referred to in Article 1 of the decision at issue, it was the members of the EIGs who had benefited from the economic advantages arising from those three measures as a result of the tax transparency of the EIGs, and who were, moreover, referred to in the order for recovery imposed in Article 4(1) of that decision.", "In paragraph 117 of that judgment, it held that, in the absence of an economic advantage in favour of the EIGs, the Commission was wrong to conclude that they had benefited from State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "Therefore, in paragraph 118 of that judgment, it concluded that, ‘since it is the investors, and not the EIGs, that benefited from the tax and economic advantages resulting from the STL system, it is appropriate to examine … whether the advantages obtained by the investors are selective, are liable to distort competition and affect trade between Member States and whether the [decision at issue] contains a sufficient statement of reasons concerning the analysis of those criteria.’", "39", "Having recalled in paragraph 164 of the judgment under appeal that the analysis of the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue in the decision at issue was also based on the finding that the STL system favoured certain activities, namely the acquisition of vessels through leasing contracts, in particular with a view to their bareboat chartering and subsequent resale, the General Court stated in paragraphs 171 and 176 of that judgment that that finding referred to the activities of the EIGs set up for the purposes of the STL system but did not relate to the industrial or economic activities of the members of the EIGs, who take shares in the EIGs as investors.", "It concluded in paragraphs 176 and 180 of that judgment that the selectivity of the tax measures at issue could not be established on the basis of that finding.", "40", "It appears from those considerations that, without calling into question the Commission’s description of the STL system in the decision at issue, which is set out in the judgment under appeal and summarised in paragraphs 4 to 9 above, or, in particular, the findings that the tax measures at issue had been granted to the EIGs and had favoured the activities which they carried on, the General Court concluded that the EIGs could not be the beneficiaries of State aid solely on the ground that, as a result of the tax transparency of those groupings, it was the investors, and not the EIGs, who had benefited from the tax and economic advantages resulting from those measures.", "41", "In addition to the fact that it contradicts the finding in paragraph 116 of the judgment under appeal that the EIGs had benefited from the three tax measures referred to in Article 1 of the decision at issue, that conclusion incorrectly applies Article 107(1) TFEU.", "42", "According to the description of the STL system, the EIGs carried on an economic activity, namely the acquisition of vessels through leasing contracts, in particular with a view to their bareboat chartering and subsequent resale, from which it follows that they were undertakings within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU and the case-law recalled in paragraph 34 above, and from what the Commission stated in recital 126 of the decision at issue.", "43", "It was the EIGs which, first, applied to the tax authority, under Article 115(1) TRLIS, for the benefit of early depreciation of leased assets, which they were granted, and, secondly, left the normal corporate taxation system and opted for the tonnage tax system, as applied under Article 50(3) RIS.", "It was also the EIGs which collected the tax benefits in two stages, as has been stated in paragraph 9 above, by the combination of the tax measures at issue.", "44", "The resulting economic advantages, according to the facts established in paragraph 5.3.2.6. of the decision at issue, corresponded to the advantages which the EIGs would not have achieved in the same operation by the sole application of general measures, namely the interest saved on the amounts of tax payments deferred by virtue of early depreciation, the amount of tax avoided or interest saved on tax deferred by virtue of the tonnage tax system and the amount of tax avoided on the capital gain made on the sale of the vessel.", "The STL system therefore involved the use of public resources in the form of lost tax revenue and unpaid interest, as was found in paragraph 5.3.3. of that decision.", "45", "It is true that those advantages were transferred in full to the members of the EIGs because, with the EIGs being fiscally transparent as regards the members residing in Spain, the profits or losses made by the EIGs were automatically transferred to their members residing in that Member State pro rata to their shares.", "Nevertheless, the fact remains that the tax measures at issue were applied to the EIGs and that they were the direct beneficiaries of the advantages arising from those measures.", "Those advantages, according to recital 157 of the decision at issue, favoured the activity of acquiring vessels through leasing contracts, in particular with a view to their bareboat chartering and subsequent resale, carried on by the EIGs.", "46", "In the light of the case-law referred to in paragraphs 35 to 37 above, it follows that the tax measures at issue were such as to constitute State aid in favour of the EIGs and that therefore, by not acknowledging that the EIGs were beneficiaries of those measures on the ground that those entities were fiscally transparent, the General Court held that they could not be the beneficiaries of State aid solely because of their legal form and the relevant rules on the taxation of profits.", "Such an exclusion is not in keeping with the case-law set out in paragraphs 34 and 36 above, from which it follows that the classification of a measure as ‘State aid’ cannot depend on the legal status of the undertakings concerned or the techniques used.", "47", "That conclusion is not affected by the Commission’s decision to order the recovery of the incompatible aid from the EIG investors alone, the legality of which is not to be determined by the Court of Justice in the present appeal.", "48", "It follows that the first complaint in the first part of the first ground of appeal is well founded.", "Second part of the first ground of appeal", "– Arguments of the parties", "49", "In the second part of the first ground of appeal, the Commission alleges that the General Court, in paragraphs 157 to 163 of the judgment under appeal, erred in law in its analysis of the selective advantage resulting from the tax authority’s discretionary power.", "The General Court based its reasoning on the incorrect premiss that the EIGs could not benefit from a tax advantage and failed to have regard to settled case-law according to which a measure of an apparently general nature becomes selective where the advantage is granted by way of a discretionary procedure.", "50", "In addition, where it is the discretionary power per se which makes it possible to place certain undertakings in a more favourable situation than that of other undertakings, the General Court carried out an ex post assessment and thus confused selectivity based on the discretionary management criterion and de facto selectivity which depends on an examination of the actual behaviour of the authority which grants the advantage.", "Moreover, the administrative authorisations which made it possible to apply early depreciation and the tonnage tax system were given only to the EIGs engaged in the financing and bareboat chartering of vessels, which placed them in a more favourable situation than that of other undertakings.", "51", "The Kingdom of Spain submits that the General Court stated that the existence of the tax authority’s discretionary power was not established and that it is a finding of a factual nature which cannot be submitted for review by the Court of Justice.", "Furthermore, as the General Court also found, that power was very limited since it involved determining, not the beneficiaries, but only the type of assets capable of benefiting from early depreciation.", "The condition, derived from case-law, that, in order to classify the selectivity of the advantage at issue, there must be a broad discretion making it possible to determine the beneficiaries and the conditions of the measure granted on the basis of criteria unrelated to the tax system, has not been satisfied.", "In addition, contrary to what is claimed by the Commission, the General Court did not examine ex post the selectivity of the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue instead of relying on the discretionary management criterion of the aid.", "52", "Lico Leasing and PYMAR submit that the reasoning of the judgment under appeal concerning the discretionary nature of the tax authority’s power in the STL mechanism is part of an assessment of the facts.", "Moreover, they submit that the General Court made an accurate assessment of the selectivity of the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue, by ruling out both selectivity based on the tax authority’s discretionary power and de facto selectivity.", "53", "Similarly, Bankia and Others claim that the General Court did not err in law in finding that there was no de jure or de facto selectivity.", "In their opinion, even if there was sectoral selectivity in the maritime or shipbuilding domain, that selectivity did not concern the investors who are, nevertheless, identified as being the ultimate and sole beneficiaries of the tax measures at issue.", "54", "Aluminios Cortizo supports the arguments advanced by the Kingdom of Spain, Lico Leasing and PYMAR, and Bankia and Others.", "– Findings of the Court", "55", "It must be recalled that, in order to establish the selective nature of a tax advantage, it is not necessary for the competent national authorities to have the discretionary power to grant the benefit of that measure.", "However, the existence of such a discretion may be such as to enable those authorities to favour certain undertakings or the production of certain goods to the detriment of others and therefore establish the existence of aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 July 2004, Spain v Commission, C‑501/00, EU:C:2004:438, paragraph 121).", "That is so, in particular, where the competent authorities have a discretionary power to determine the beneficiaries and the conditions of the measure granted on the basis of criteria unrelated to the tax system.", "On the other hand, the application of an authorisation system in which the competent authorities only have a latitude limited by objective criteria which are not unrelated to the tax system established by the legislation in question could not, in principle, be regarded as selective (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 July 2013, P, C‑6/12, EU:C:2013:525, paragraphs 26 and 27).", "56", "In the present case, in order to find that the Commission had wrongly considered, in recital 156 of the decision at issue, that the advantages resulting from the STL system as a whole were selective because they were dependent on the discretionary power conferred on the tax authority, the General Court, in paragraph 158 of the judgment under appeal, found that, despite the existence of an authorisation system involving alleged discretionary elements, those advantages remained open under the same conditions to any investor who decided to participate in the transactions within the STL system, aimed at financing ships through the purchase of shareholdings in the EIGs created by the banks.", "57", "Having stated in paragraph 159 of that judgment that the conditions for authorising early depreciation concerned, de jure, only the characteristics of the asset which may be depreciated early, that the Commission had indicated in the decision at issue that the exercise of the discretionary power had led the tax authority to accept the early depreciation only for a specific category of assets and that the advantages at issue had not been refused for any operation under the STL system, the General Court, in paragraphs 160 and 162 of the judgment under appeal, held that, even if it were established, that discretionary power would have resulted, de jure and de facto, only in defining the type of operation capable of benefiting from the tax advantages at issue, that is to say, STL operations to finance vessels, to the exclusion of other assets, and that it remained the case that the possibility of taking part in those transactions and accessing the advantages in question was open to any undertaking.", "It concluded that the existence of an authorisation system does not mean, in the present case, that the advantages from which the investors benefited may be considered selective.", "58", "It must be pointed out that those considerations are based on the incorrect premiss that only the investors, and not the EIGs, could be regarded as the beneficiaries of the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue and that it was therefore by reference to the investors, and not the EIGs, that the condition relating to selectivity had to be examined.", "Therefore, in failing to examine whether the system for authorising early depreciation, as provided for in Article 48(4) and in Article 115(11) TRLIS, and Article 49 RIS, conferred on the tax authority a discretionary power such as to favour the activities carried on by the EIGs involved in the STL system or having the effect of favouring such activities, the General Court erred in law.", "59", "The second part of the first ground of appeal must therefore be upheld.", "Third part of the first ground of appeal", "– Arguments of the parties", "60", "In the third part of the first ground of appeal, the Commission criticises the General Court for having held, in paragraphs 139 to 155 of the judgment under appeal, relying on the judgments of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938), and of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939), that the fact that the tax advantages are granted on the basis of investments in a particular asset to the exclusion of other assets or other types of investments does not mean that they are selective vis-à-vis investors, since the operation is available to any undertaking.", "However, having set aside those judgments in the judgment of21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others (C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981), the Court of Justice rejected that approach.", "Furthermore, the General Court erred in its analysis of the case-law.", "61", "According to the Kingdom of Spain, the Commission fails to mention that, although the General Court took into consideration the judgments of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938), and of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939), it nevertheless expressly stated that it was giving its ruling in the context of existing case-law and followed established case-law on tax.", "It follows from that case-law that a tax regime is not selective if it is applicable without distinction to all economic operators.", "In the present case, the Commission did not identify a category of undertakings benefiting from a derogation or the terms of the comparison between those undertakings and those which could not benefit from it.", "62", "Lico Leasing and PYMAR argue that, since the tax measures at issue were not selective in that any undertaking without discrimination could invest in the EIGs and benefit from the advantages resulting from those investments, the General Court did not commit an error when it ruled out, for that reason, the selective nature of the advantages obtained by the investors in the context of the STL system.", "That assessment is not called into question by the judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others (C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981), because there is no derogation in the STL system favouring certain taxpayers over other taxpayers in a comparable factual and legal situation under the reference tax system or discrimination between different categories of investors, since the STL system is merely a means of tax optimisation accessible to all.", "In addition, the decision at issue does not contain any reasons regarding the elements needed to apply the criteria set out in that judgment, in particular the criteria for determining the reference framework.", "63", "Bankia and Others state that it is apparent from the judgment under appeal that the Commission itself distinguished the present case from the one giving rise to the judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others (C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981) by stating that the advantages arising from the STL were granted to investors not because they carried out mere investment operations, but because they carried out certain economic activities through the EIGs.", "In any event, unlike that case, the tax measures at issue do not favour entities in a factual and legal situation comparable to that of other entities, since the Commission has not demonstrated and has not even defined the reference framework.", "– Findings of the Court", "64", "It is apparent from paragraphs 130 and 132 of the judgment under appeal that, since the Kingdom of Spain, and Lico Leasing and PYMAR observed before the General Court that the possibility of participating in the structures of the STL system and therefore of obtaining the advantages arising from it was open to any investor operating in all sectors of the economy without any precondition or restriction, so that the advantages obtained by the investors could not be regarded as selective, in particular in the light of the judgments of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938), and of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939), the Commission argued that the tax measures at issue were selective vis-à-vis investors, because only the undertakings which made a certain type of investment through an EIG benefited from it, while undertakings which made similar investments as part of other operations could not benefit from it.", "65", "In order to reject that argument of the Commission, set out in paragraph 144 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court, in paragraphs 139 to 143 of that judgment, referred to the judgments of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938), and of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939) and, having stated that, as in the cases which gave rise to those judgments, any operator could benefit from the tax advantages at issue by carrying out a certain type of operation available, on the same terms, to any undertaking, without distinction, it considered that, as in those cases, the fact that the advantages were granted as a result of an investment in a particular asset to the exclusion of other assets or types of investment did not make them selective vis-à-vis the investors, in that the operation was available to any undertaking.", "66", "Analysing next, in paragraphs 146 to 154 of the judgment under appeal, the judgment of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission (C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467) and the case-law of the General Court, it considered, in paragraphs 148 to 150 of the judgment under appeal, that it was clear that, where an advantage is granted, on the same terms, to any undertaking on the basis of a certain type of investment available to any operator, it acquires a general nature with respect to those operators and does not constitute State aid in favour of them.", "It concluded, in paragraph 155 of that judgment, that the advantages obtained by the investors who participated in the STL operations could not be considered to be selective on the ground that only the undertakings carrying out that particular type of investment through an EIG benefited from it.", "67", "In that regard, it must be observed that the analysis of the plea made in its defence by the Commission before the General Court is based on the incorrect premiss that only the investors, and not the EIGs, could be regarded as the beneficiaries of the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue and that it was therefore by reference to the investors, and not the EIGs, that the condition relating to selectivity had to be examined.", "68", "Moreover, in the judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others (C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981), the Court of Justice held that the reasoning in the judgments of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938), and of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939) was based on a misapplication of the condition relating to selectivity laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU.", "According to that reasoning, the existence of a derogation from or exception to the reference framework identified by the Commission cannot, in itself, establish that the measure at issue favours ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ within the meaning of that provision, where that measure is available, a priori, to any undertaking and is directed, not at a particular category of undertakings, which would have been the only undertakings favoured by that measure, but at a category of economic transactions.", "69", "In paragraph 67 of the judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others (C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981), the Court recalled that, with regard to a national measure conferring a tax advantage of general application, the condition relating to selectivity is satisfied where the Commission is able to demonstrate that that measure is a derogation from the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, thereby introducing, through its actual effects, differences in the treatment of operators, although the operators who qualify for the tax advantage and those who do not are, in the light of the objective pursued by that Member State’s tax system, in a comparable factual and legal situation.", "In paragraphs 70 and 71 of that judgment, the Court stated that the supplementary requirement to identify a particular category of undertakings which are exclusively favoured by the measure in question and which may be distinguished by reason of specific properties, common to them and characteristic of them, cannot be inferred from the case-law of the Court of Justice.", "70", "In addition, in paragraphs 80 and 81 of the judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others (C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981), the Court recalled that the fact that the recipient undertakings belong to various economic sectors is not sufficient to call into question the selective nature of the measure concerned and held that the potentially selective nature of the measure at issue is in no way called into question by the fact that the essential condition for obtaining the tax advantage conferred by that measure is that there should be an economic transaction, more particularly an entirely financial transaction, which is available regardless of the nature of the business of the recipient undertakings.", "71", "It follows that, by holding, for the purpose of rejecting the plea made in its defence by the Commission, that the advantages obtained by the investors which participated in the STL operations could not be regarded as selective, since those operations were available, on the same terms, to any undertaking, without distinction, without ascertaining whether the Commission had established that the tax measures at issue, by their practical effects, introduced differentiated treatment of operators, where the operators which benefited from the tax advantages and those which were excluded from it, were, in view of the objective pursued by that tax system, in a comparable factual and legal situation, the General Court committed an error of law.", "72", "Consequently, the third part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld.", "The second complaint in the first part of the first ground of appeal and the second ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "73", "In support of the second complaint in the first part of the first ground of appeal, the Commission claims that, in paragraphs 169 to 177 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court infringed Article 296 TFEU in finding that the decision at issue was vitiated by a failure to state reasons or by contradictory reasoning.", "The idea of an economic unit formed by the EIG and its members is present throughout the decision at issue, and the reasoning followed by that decision concerning the selectivity of the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue is based on the notion of ‘undertaking’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "Although the General Court accepted that that decision had demonstrated the selectivity of the tax measures at issue, finding that they had favoured certain activities, it then limited its examination to the advantages obtained by the investors by separating the EIGs and their members.", "74", "The findings of the General Court in paragraph 175 of the judgment under appeal relating to recital 28 of the decision at issue distort its content by attributing to it contradictions that do not exist.", "That recital, describing the members of the EIGs as ‘investors’, contains no assessment by the Commission which contradicts any other; it merely reproduces the arguments of certain interested parties and makes a terminological choice which does not change the nature of the EIG.", "75", "In support of its second ground of appeal, the Commission relies on errors of law concerning the obligation to state reasons and distortion of the decision at issue in paragraphs 198 to 208 of the judgment under appeal.", "The General Court considered that the particular facts of the case required a higher standard of reasoning in that decision with regard to the risk of distortion of competition and the effect on trade, even though, unlike the case giving rise to the judgment of 30 April 2009, Commission v Italy and Wam (C‑494/06 P, EU:C:2009:272), to which it referred, no new and exceptional circumstance in the present case made such a statement of reasons necessary.", "In particular, there is no doubt that the effect of the tax measures at issue was a direct reduction of the corporate income tax base, that the EIGs and their members operated on liberalised European markets in which they were in competition with other operators and that the advantages arising from those measures were not of a small amount.", "76", "The General Court was wrong in finding that the decision at issue was not sufficiently reasoned with regard to the existence of a risk of distortion to the market on which the EIGs operated, since that decision did not explain the reasons why the EIGs formed a single economic unit with their investors.", "Aside from that, the existence of a distortion of competition on that market is sufficient to establish that that condition for the application of Article 107(1) TFEU has been satisfied.", "77", "The Kingdom of Spain submits that the Commission sets out its position on the economic unit formed by the EIGs and their members, relied on for the first time before the General Court.", "That argument runs counter to the very essence of an EIG which is merely an instrument that makes it possible to channel tax advantages.", "Moreover, although, when referring to the ‘EIGs and/or their investors’ in the decision at issue, the Commission wanted to indicate that they constituted a single economic unit, it should have provided a sufficient statement of reasons.", "Similarly, that decision did not explain clearly that the EIGs belong to a particular sector of activity.", "The General Court is therefore correct in finding that that decision was not sufficiently reasoned.", "78", "Contrary to what the Commission submits, the General Court did not require, as regards the risk of distortion of competition and the effect on trade, a higher standard of reasoning than that required by the case-law, and the reference to the judgment of 30 April 2009, Commission v Italy and Wam (C‑494/06 P, EU:C:2009:272), in the judgment under appeal is not decisive for the rationale that led to the General Court’s conclusion concerning the reasoning of the decision at issue.", "Nevertheless, there are similarities between the circumstances of the case that gave rise to that judgment and those of the present case.", "Furthermore, since the Commission did not identify the group or category of undertakings which benefited from the tax measures at issue, the General Court cannot be criticised for having considered that the Commission also failed to fulfil its obligation to state reasons with regard to the distortion of competition and the effect on trade, since there is a correlation between the selectivity of an advantage and the distortion of competition.", "79", "Lico Leasing et PYMAR also submit that, assuming that the argument concerning the economic unit formed by the EIGs and their members was included in the decision at issue, that decision is vitiated by a lack of reasoning in that regard, as the General Court stated in the alternative.", "Similarly, they note that the General Court did not require a higher standard of reasoning with regard to the risk of distortion of competition and the effect on trade, but found that there was no reasoning at all on that point.", "With regard to a complex case in which the distortion of competition occurred, according to the Commission, at two different levels, an adequate statement of reasons must then be provided, according to Lico Leasing and PYMAR.", "The assertion in the decision at issue that the beneficiaries of the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue operated in all sectors of the economy and that those advantages strengthened their position on their respective markets is general in nature and does not explain why the SLT system specifically posed a risk of distorting competition and effecting trade between Member States.", "With regard to the effect on the market for bareboat chartering and the purchase and sale of ships, the decision at issue is vitiated by a number of contradictions and inconsistencies with regard to the activity of the EIGs and, therefore, also with regard to the capacity of the tax measures at issue to distort competition and to affect trade.", "80", "According to Bankia and Others, the existence of an economic unit formed by the EIGs and their members was raised out of time and is not apparent from the decision at issue, so that the General Court was correct in stating, in the alternative, that the reasoning of that decision was defective.", "In view of the particular circumstances of the present case, it was, in their opinion, incumbent on the Commission to supply further indications to explain how the advantages retained by the investors, and not by the shipping companies or the shipyards, were liable to distort or threaten to distort competition and affect trade in the markets in which those investors were active.", "81", "Aluminios Cortizo submits that the Commission did not indicate in the decision at issue the reasons why it did not assess the selectivity of the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue on the shipbuilding market, which was the only market concerned.", "Moreover, according to Aluminios Cortizo, no distortion of competition could be established, since the investors operated in all sectors of the economy, and such distortion exists only where the measure at issue is selective.", "Since the decision at issue does not provide any explanation in that regard, the General Court was correct in finding that there was an inadequate statement of reasons for that decision.", "As regards the EIGs, given that they were only financial instruments derived from the mere implementation of contractual clauses, they did not participate in any market, and so a distortion of the market could not be established at that level either.", "Findings of the Court", "82", "As the General Court recalled in paragraph 185 of the judgment under appeal, according to settled case-law, the statement of reasons required by Article 296 TFEU must be appropriate to the act at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted the measure in question in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for the measure and to enable the Court of the European Union to exercise its power of review.", "It is not necessary for the reasoning to go into all the relevant facts and points of law, since the question whether the statement of reasons meets the requirements of Article 296 TFEU must be assessed with regard not only to its wording but also to its context and to all the legal rules governing the matter in question (see, inter alia, judgments of 6 September 2006, Portugal v Commission, C‑88/03, EU:C:2006:511, paragraph 88, and of 2 December 2009, Commission v Ireland and Others, C‑89/08 P, EU:C:2009:742, paragraph 77).", "83", "Applied to the classification of a measure as aid, that principle requires a statement of the reasons for which the Commission considers that the measure concerned falls within the scope of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "Even where the very circumstances in which the aid has been granted show that it is liable to affect trade between Member States and to distort or threaten to distort competition, the Commission must at least set out those circumstances in the statement of reasons for its decision (judgments of 6 September 2006, Portugal v Commission, C‑88/03, EU:C:2006:511, paragraph 89, and of 30 April 2009, Commission v Italy and Wam, C‑494/06 P, EU:C:2009:272, paragraph 49).", "84", "With regard to the condition concerning distortion of competition, as recalled by the General Court in paragraph 188 of the judgment under appeal, it is clear from the case-law of the Court of Justice that, in principle, aid intended to release an undertaking from costs which it would normally have to bear in its day-to-day management or normal activities distorts the conditions of competition (judgments of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission, C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467, paragraph 30, and of 3 March 2005, Heiser, C‑172/03, EU:C:2005:130, paragraph 55).", "85", "As regards the criterion of trade being affected, as the General Court recalled in paragraph 191 of the judgment under appeal, it follows from the case-law of the Court of Justice that the grant of aid by a Member State, in the form of a tax relief, to some of its taxable persons must be regarded as likely to have an effect on trade and, consequently, as fulfilling that criterion, where those taxable persons perform an economic activity in the field of such trade or it is conceivable that they are in competition with operators established in other Member States (judgments of 3 March 2005, Heiser, C‑172/03, EU:C:2005:130, paragraph 35, and of 30 April 2009, Commission v Italy and Wam, C‑494/06 P, EU:C:2009:272, paragraph 51).", "Furthermore, when aid granted by a Member State strengthens the position of an undertaking compared with other undertakings competing in trade within the European Union, those undertakings must be regarded as affected by that aid (judgment of 10 January 2006, Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others, C‑222/04, EU:C:2006:8, paragraph 141).", "86", "It is also settled case-law that, for the purpose of categorising a national measure as ‘State aid’, it is not necessary to demonstrate that the aid has a real effect on trade between Member States and that competition is actually being distorted, but only to examine whether that aid is liable to affect such trade and distort competition (judgment of 10 January 2006, Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others, C‑222/04, EU:C:2006:8, paragraph 140 and the case-law cited).", "87", "In the present case, in paragraphs 169 to 173 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court, when determining whether the Commission’s analysis of the tax measures at issue supported the conclusion that the advantages obtained by the investors, and not by the EIGs, satisfied the condition relating to selectivity, considered that the activities referred to in the decision at issue, which benefited from those measures, that is to say, the acquisition of vessels through leasing contracts, in particular with a view to their bareboat chartering and subsequent resale, were carried on by the EIGs created for the purposes of the STL system.", "It stated that, therefore, if the Commission had considered that the advantages obtained by the investors were selective because the latter carried on those activities, it was incumbent on it to make clear that the EIGs’ activities corresponded to those of their members or, at least, that they could be attributed to them.", "The General Court stated that the decision at issue did not provide any explanation in that regard and that the Commission had merely concluded that the tax measures at issue conferred a selective advantage on the EIGs and/or their investors without providing any further clarification and without explaining, in particular, why the members of the EIGs could be considered to be carrying on the economic activities of the EIGs as though they formed a single legal or economic entity.", "88", "The General Court also stated in paragraph 174 of the judgment under appeal that the assertion in recital 172 of the decision at issue that the investors ‘are active through the EIGs in the markets for bareboat chartering and the acquisition and sale of sea-going vessels’ also seemed to contradict other recitals of that decision.", "89", "Therefore, the General Court concluded in paragraphs 176 to 177 of the judgment under appeal that the mere finding in recital 157 of the decision at issue that the STL system favoured the activities carried on by the EIGs, could not establish the selectivity of the advantages received by the investors and that, if that decision were to be construed to the effect that investors exercised, through the EIGs created for the purposes of the STL system, the particular activities of those EIGs, that decision would be vitiated by a failure to state reasons, and indeed by contradictory reasoning, on that point.", "90", "Furthermore, the General Court held in paragraph 208 of the judgment under appeal that the Commission had infringed its duty to state reasons by concluding in paragraphs 171 to 173 of the decision at issue that the tax measures at issue could distort competition and affect trade between Member States.", "In reaching that conclusion, the General Court, in the first place, in paragraphs 198 to 204 of that judgment, considered in essence that the Commission’s finding that the investors operated in all sectors of the economy and that the advantages enhanced their position on their respective markets lacked sufficient reasoning, because it involved a general assertion capable of being applied to any type of State support, and the Commission did not rely on any specific circumstance which would explain that finding; whereas, in view of the particular circumstances set out in that decision, it was incumbent on the Commission to provide further indications to explain how the advantages obtained by the investors, and not by the shipping companies or the shipyards, were liable to distort or risk distorting competition or to affect trade on the markets on which those investors operated.", "91", "In the second place, in paragraphs 205 to 207 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court considered that the duty to state reasons was not satisfied either by the finding in recital 172 of the decision at issue that, by means of the operations benefiting from the STL system, the investors operated through the EIGs on the markets for bareboat chartering and the purchase and sale of ships which are open to trade within the European Union, and the Commission did not explain in that decision why the EIGs established for the purposes of the STL system and their members formed a single legal or economic entity, so that the activities of the EIG could be attributed to their members.", "92", "In that regard, it must be observed that all of those considerations are based on the premiss that only the investors, and not the EIGs, could be regarded as the beneficiaries of the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue and that it was therefore appropriate to examine whether the advantages which the investors, and not the EIGs, had obtained were selective, whether they were liable to distort competition and affect trade between Member States and whether the decision at issue contained a sufficient statement of reasons concerning the analysis of those criteria.", "As is apparent from the examination of the first complaint in the first ground of appeal, that premiss is incorrect.", "93", "In addition, in order to assess whether the decision at issue is sufficiently reasoned with regard to the selectivity of the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue, the distortion of competition and the effect on trade between Member States, it is necessary to examine the content of that decision in its entirety.", "94", "Describing the tax structure of the STL system in paragraph 2.2 of the decision at issue, the Commission, in recitals 15 to 20 of that decision, indicated that the objective of the STL system was to generate the benefits of certain tax measures in favour of the EIG and the investors participating in it.", "It explained how, as was set out in paragraph 9 above, the EIG collected the tax benefits in two stages through a combination of the tax measures at issue.", "In paragraph 5.3.2.6. of the decision at issue, the Commission stated that the resulting economic advantages corresponded to the advantages that the EIGs would not have achieved in the same operation by the sole application of general measures, namely the interest saved on the amounts of tax payments deferred by virtue of early depreciation, the amount of tax avoided or interest saved on tax deferred by virtue of the tonnage tax system and the amount of tax avoided on the capital gain made on the sale of the vessel.", "It found in paragraph 5.3.3. of that decision that the STL system therefore involved the use of public resources in the form of lost tax revenue and unpaid interest.", "95", "As regards the shipping companies and the shipyards, the Commission set out, inter alia, in recitals 162 and 167 to 170 of the decision at issue that, in economic terms, a substantial part of the tax advantages collected by the EIGs was transferred to the shipping companies through a price rebate, but that the advantages obtained by those companies and indirectly by the shipyards were not imputable to the State, resulting from a combination of legal transactions between private entities.", "96", "With regard to the EIGs and the ‘investors’, admittedly the Commission did state in paragraph 28 of the decision at issue that ‘since the EIGs involved in STL operations are regarded as an investment vehicle by their members — rather than as a way of carrying out an activity jointly — this Decision refers to them as investors’, and it did not find in that decision that the EIGs and the investors formed an economic unit.", "97", "All the same, it is not apparent from that recital or from the decision at issue taken as a whole that the Commission endorsed the argument that the EIGs were mere investment vehicles or that those EIGs which it designated as ‘investors’ were regarded by the Commission as being anything other than members of the EIGs.", "On the contrary, the Commission stated in recital 126 of the decision at issue that the EIGs at issue were undertakings within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU and, in recital 140, that their tax transparency merely enabled different operators to join and finance or carry out any economic activity.", "In its analysis of the selectivity of the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue, in paragraph 5.3.2. and in particular in recital 161 of the decision at issue, it described the EIGs as being entities to which the tax measures at issue were granted and as the beneficiaries of those measures, and it stated in recital 157 of that decision that those measures favoured the activity of acquiring vessels through leasing contracts, in particular with a view to their bareboat chartering and subsequent resale, carried on by the EIGs.", "98", "On a number of occasions, in particular in recitals 16, 17, 28, 29 and 45 of the decision at issue, the Commission referred to the notion of ‘tax transparency’ of the EIGs, the consequence of which was the transfer to their members of all the advantages resulting from the tax measures at issue.", "Thus, in recital 166 of that decision, it stated that, ‘in the context of STL operations, the State initially transfers its resources to the EIG by financing the selective advantages [and,] by way of tax transparency, the EIG then transfers the State resources to its investors.’", "99", "In particular, by setting out all of those considerations, the Commission, in its examination of the condition relating to distortion of competition and that of effect on trade in recitals 171 to 173 of the decision at issue, stated that the members of the EIGs operated in all sectors of the economy, particularly in sectors open to trade between Member States, and that, in addition, by means of the operations benefiting from the STL system, they operated through the EIGs on the markets for bareboat chartering and the purchase and sale of ships, which are also open to trade between Member States, so that the advantages arising from the STL system strengthened their position in their respective markets, thereby distorting or threatening to distort competition.", "It concluded that the economic advantages which the EIGs and their investors enjoyed could affect trade between Member States and distort competition in the internal market.", "100", "Apart from the fact that the premiss that the investors operated through the EIGs on the markets for bareboat chartering and the purchase and sale of ships does not contradict recital 28 of the decision at issue, similarly, and contrary to what the General Court stated in paragraph 175 of the judgment under appeal, it does not contradict recital 27 of that decision, according to which the EIGs had a separate legal personality from their members.", "101", "It appears from those considerations that the Commission provided information in the decision at issue making it possible to understand the reasons why it considered that the advantages arising from the tax measures at issue were of a selective nature and were liable to affect trade between Member States and distort competition, and that, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, it adequately explained the reasons for that decision, withut contradiction in that respect, in keeping with the requirements of Article 296 TFEU, as defined by the case-law set out in paragraphs 82 to 86 above.", "102", "It follows that the second complaint in the first part of the first ground of appeal and the second ground of appeal must be upheld.", "103", "Consequently, the judgment under appeal must be set aside.", "Referral of the case back to the Court of First Instance", "104", "According to the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the latter may, where the decision of the General Court has been set aside, either itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits, or refer the case back to the General Court for judgment.", "105", "In the present case, since the General Court examined only some of the pleas in law put forward by the parties, the Court of Justice considers that the state of the proceedings does not permit it to give final judgment.", "The case must therefore be referred back to the General Court.", "Costs", "106", "Since the case is being referred back to the General Court, it is appropriate to reserve the costs.", "107", "In accordance with Article 140(3) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice,

the judgment of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities of 6 September 2006 in Joined Cases T‑304/04 and T‑316/04 Italy and Wam v Commission (‘the judgment under appeal’) by which the Court of First Instance annulled Commission Decision 2006/177/EC of 19 May 2004 on State aid No C 4/2003 (ex NN 102/2002) implemented by Italy for WAM SpA (OJ 2006 L 63, p. 11; ‘the contested decision’).", "Background to the dispute", "2.", "Article 2 of Law No 394 of 29 July 1981 (GURI No 206 of 29 July 1981) on support measures for Italian exports provides the legal basis under which the Italian authorities may grant subsidised finance to exporting companies undertaking market penetration programmes in non-member States.", "3.", "Wam SpA (‘Wam’) is an Italian company which designs, manufactures and sells industrial mixing machinery and components, mainly for use in the food, chemical, pharmaceutical and environmental industries.", "4.", "On 24 November 1995, the Italian authorities decided to award Wam a first grant of aid consisting of a subsidised loan of ITL 2 281 485 000 (approximately EUR 1.18 million) in order to facilitate its penetration of the Japanese, South Korean and Taiwanese markets.", "Following an economic crisis in Korea and Taiwan, the planned projects were not implemented in those countries.", "Wam actually received a loan of ITL 1 358 505 421 (approximately EUR 700 000) towards the establishment of permanent structures and the costs of trade promotion in the Far East.", "5.", "On 9 November 2000, the same authorities decided to award Wam a second grant of aid consisting of a second subsidised loan of ITL 3 603 574 689 (approximately EUR 1.8 million).", "The programme financed by that loan was to be implemented in China by Wam and by Wam Bulk Handling Machinery (Shanghai) Co.", "Ltd, a local business fully controlled by Wam.", "6.", "Following receipt of a complaint in 1999, the Commission opened an inquiry into the State aids allegedly granted to Wam.", "On 21 January 2003, it decided to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC, a decision which targeted the State aid allegedly granted to WAM.", "7.", "On 19 May 2004, the Commission adopted the contested decision.", "With regard to the question whether the first and second grants of aid (‘the aid at issue’) constitute ‘State aid’ within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, as recitals 75 to 79 of the contested decision states:", "‘(75) [The aid at issue] consists of transfers of public funding, in the form of subsidised loans, to a specific undertaking, WAM SpA.", "These loans improve the financial situation of the aid recipient.", "As regards the potential effect on trade between Member States, it has been stressed by the Court of Justice that, even if the aid is intended to promote exports outside the EU, intra-Community trade may be affected.", "Moreover, having regard to the interdependence between the markets on which Community undertakings operate, it is possible that such aid might distort competition within the Community.", "(76) WAM SpA has subsidiaries all around the world, including in almost all the EU Member States, including France, the Netherlands, Finland, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Belgium and Germany.", "In particular, the complainant stressed that it competed on the Community market directly with “WAM Engineering Ltd” which is the subsidiary for the United Kingdom and Ireland of WAM SpA, and that it was losing many orders to the Italian company.", "Furthermore, as regards outward-looking competition among Community undertakings, it transpired that the programme financed by the [second grant of aid] and designed to support business penetration in China, was to be jointly carried out by WAM SpA and andamp; “WAM Bulk Handling Machinery Shangai Co.", "Ltd”, a local firm wholly owned by WAM SpA.", "(77) According to the case law of the Court of Justice, even if the recipient exports almost its entire production outside the EU, the EEA and the accession countries, any subsidising of export activities can affect trade between Member States.", "(78) Moreover, in the case at hand, it has been ascertained that in the period 1995-1999 sales abroad accounted for between 52% and 57,5% of the overall annual turnover of WAM SpA, two thirds of which was generated inside the EU (in absolute figures, some EUR 10 million compared with EUR 5 million).", "(79) Accordingly, irrespective of whether [the aid at issue] supports exports to other Member States or outside the EU, it has the potential to affect trade between Member States and is, therefore, caught by Article 87(1) [EC].’", "The action before the Court of First Instance and the judgment under appeal", "8.", "The Italian Republic and Wam applied separately for the annulment of the contested decision before the Court of First Instance.", "The actions were subsequently joined.", "The Italian Republic relied on seven grounds in its application.", "Wam relied on ten.", "Among the grounds invoked was the allegation that the Commission had breached its obligation to give adequate reasoning for the contested decision.", "9.", "By the judgment under appeal, the Second Chamber of the Court of First Instance annulled the contested decision.", "It did so on the basis that the Commission had breached the obligation to state reasons.", "10.", "The Court of First Instance pointed out in paragraph 59 of the judgment under appeal that the classification as ‘aid’, in the sense of State aid incompatible with the common market, requires that all the conditions set out in Article 87(1) EC are fulfilled.", "Those conditions are as follows.", "First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources.", "Second, the intervention must be likely to affect trade between Member States.", "Third, it must confer an advantage on the recipient by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods.", "Fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition.", "11.", "The Court of First Instance held, in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, that it was not automatically established that the aid at issue had affected trade between Member States or that it distorted or threatened to distort competition and that such a possibility should have been illustrated.", "In that respect, the Commission should have mentioned in the contested decision the relevant information concerning the foreseeable effects of the aid at issue.", "However, the Court of First Instance emphasised that the Commission was not under an obligation to show its real effect.", "12.", "The Court of First Instance held in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal that the reasoning set out in recitals 75 and 77 of the contested decision was ‘based on a reference to the legal principles drawn from case-law and on the fact that effects on trade and on competition cannot be excluded, and cannot in itself be regarded as fulfilling the requirements of Article 253 EC’.", "13.", "Regarding the finding at recital 75 of the contested decision that ‘[t]hese loans improve the financial situation of the aid recipient’, the Court of First Instance held that it is not directly connected to the conditions relating to the effects on trade and the distortion of competition but, in a more general manner, to the conferral of an advantage on a specific undertaking which is a further characteristic of the notion of State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC.", "The Court went on to find in paragraph 67 of the judgment under appeal that ‘the grant of aid to a specific undertaking, which is inherent in every State aid, and the associated improvement of the financial situation of that undertaking is not sufficient to show that that aid fulfils all the criteria of Article 87(1) EC’.", "14.", "With regard to the reasons in recitals 76 and 78 of the contested decision, the Court of First Instance found at paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal that they were ‘information which make it possible to show that Wam is active on the global and Community market, that it was engaged in trade, in particular [by means of] its exports, and that it competes with other undertakings’.", "15.", "On the other hand, the Court found at paragraph 69 of the judgment under appeal that ‘the information fails to indicate how, due to the grant of the aid at issue and having regard to its characteristics as well as the circumstances of the present case, trade between Member States was likely to be affected or competition was likely to be distorted or in danger of being distorted.", "However, they are just one set of circumstances, amongst others, which must be appraised in order to analyse the possible effects of the aid at issue’.", "16.", "The Court rejected the Commission’s argument that the distortion of competition is due to the fact that, by virtue of the aid at issue, Wam’s position was strengthened vis-à-vis undertakings from other Member States who are potential competitors.", "17.", "The Court of First Instance held that the argument was not relevant since the contested decision did not contain any express indication to that effect or sufficient material concerning such a strengthening.", "For the same reasons, the Court of First Instance rejected the argument that the aid at issue enabled Wam to implement its programme designed to penetrate foreign markets and to free resources at Community level for other purposes.", "18.", "The Court of First Instance dismissed the Commission’s assertion that it was not necessary to examine the interdependence between Community and Far Eastern markets, since Wam is engaged in intra-Community trade.", "The Court held at paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal that ‘the bald statement that Wam was involved in intra-Community trade was inadequate to show a likely effect on such trade or a distortion or threatened distortion of competition and, therefore, a detailed examination of the effects of the aid was necessary, taking into account, in particular, the fact that it met expenses incurred on the Far Eastern market, as well as, to the extent necessary, the interdependence between that market and the EU market’.", "19.", "Furthermore, the Court of First Instance found in paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal that the contested decision refers to the interdependence of the markets in which Community undertakings operate but without putting forward, contrary to the judgment in Case C‑142/87 Belgium v Commission [1990] ECR I‑959 (‘ Tubemeuse ’), paragraphs 36 to 38, precise probative material to support the contention, in recital 75 of that decision, and applying the ‘ Tubemeuse principle’ that such interdependence means that the aid at issue is likely to affect competition within the Community.", "20.", "Finally, regarding recital 79 of the contested decision, which mentions that ‘irrespective of whether [the aid at issue] support[s] exports to other Member States or outside the EU, it has the potential to affect trade between Member States and is, therefore, caught by Article 87(1) EC’, the Court of First Instance held at paragraph 75 of the judgment under appeal that the contested decision ‘did not contain a formal assessment of the distortion of competition and therefore apparently disregards the necessity of that condition for the application of that article’.", "21.", "In paragraph 75 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance held, first, that ‘there is no clear evidence that the aid at issue is intended to support exports to other Member States and second, that its aim is not to directly and immediately support exports outside the EU, but to finance an export programme designed to penetrate a third-country market’.", "22.", "The Court held in paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal that the reasons set out in recitals 74 to 79 of the contested decision do not make it possible to understand, in the circumstances of the present case, how the aid at issue is capable of affecting trade between Member States and of distorting or threatening to distort competition and that, therefore, the circumstances referred to in the contested decision do not constitute a sufficient statement of reasons to support the conclusions which the Commission reached with regard to the application of Article 87(1) EC.", "23.", "Accordingly, the Court of First Instance, without considering the other pleas put forward by the Italian Republic and by Wam, annulled the contested decision for the inadequacy of the statement of reasons on which it is based, inasmuch as the reasons given were not adequate to justify the conclusion that the aid granted met all the conditions of Article 87(1) EC.", "Forms of order sought", "24.", "By its appeal, the  Commission claims that the Court should:", "– set aside the judgment under appeal;", "– by giving final judgment in the matter, dismiss the appeal as inadmissible;", "– in the alternative, refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for re-examination; and", "– order the Italian Republic and Wam to pay the costs of the proceedings before both courts.", "25.", "The Italian Republic contends that the Court should declare inadmissible or dismiss the Commission’s appeal and order it to pay the costs of the proceedings.", "26.", "Wam requests the Court, as the main plea, to dismiss the application as being inadmissible or, in the alternative, as being unfounded.", "Wholly in the alternative, Wam requests the Court to declare that the contested decision is invalid for other reasons or, in the further alternative, to refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for judgment, and in any event to order the Commission to pay all the costs of the case, including those in these proceedings.", "The appeal", "Admissibility", "27.", "Both Italy and Wam contest the admissibility of the appeal.", "28.", "Italy argues that the Commission’s contention that the judgment of the Court of First Instance is inconsistent with the case-law of the Court of Justice is a ground of appeal which does not relate to a point of law.", "29.", "In that respect, it should be borne in mind that, pursuant to Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, an appeal to the Court of Justice is to be limited to points of law and is to lie on grounds, in particular, of infringement of Community law by the Court of First Instance.", "30.", "As the Advocate General states in point 20 of her Opinion, the Commission’s appeal is based, precisely, upon the allegation that the Court of First Instance has infringed Community law by failing to follow and apply the interpretation of Articles 87 EC and 253 EC laid down in the case-law of the Court of Justice.", "31.", "It follows that the Italian Republic’s argument that the appeal is not based on a point of law must be rejected.", "32.", "Regarding Wam’s argument that the Commission’s appeal invites the Court of Justice, first, to review the substance of the judgment under appeal rather than being limited to a review of an ‘essential procedural requirement’ as laid down in Article 230 EC, and, second, to carry out a review of the substance over which the Court of Justice has no jurisdiction at the appeal stage, it should be noted that Article 230 EC gives the Court of Justice jurisdiction to review acts of Community institutions other than the Court of First Instance.", "Appeals against the judgments of the Court of First Instance are governed, however, by the terms of Article 225(1) EC and the Statute of the Court of Justice.", "33.", "Next, it must be noted that the obligation to provide a statement of reasons is an essential procedural requirement which must be distinguished from the question whether the reasoning is well founded, the latter being concerned with the substantive legality of the measure at issue (see to that effect, Case C‑310/99 Italy v Commission [2002] ECR I‑2289, paragraph 48).", "Since the objective of the Commission’s single ground of appeal is precisely to contest the legal analysis of the obligation of the Court of First Instance to provide a statement of reasons, the Commission cannot be criticised for inviting the Court of Justice to re-examine the substance of the contested decision.", "34.", "It follows that Wam’s argument concerning the admissibility of the Commission’s single ground of appeal must be dismissed.", "35.", "Accordingly, the appeal must be held admissible.", "Substance", "Arguments of the parties", "36.", "The Commission relies on one ground of appeal, alleging that the judgment under appeal is vitiated by an error of law in that it finds the statement of reasons in the contested decision inadequate.", "It maintains that, having held that for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC the mere finding of an undertaking’s involvement in intra-Community trade is not sufficient to establish the existence of an effect on trade or of a distortion of competition, the Court of First Instance infringed the combined provisions of Article 87(1) EC and Article 253 EC.", "The Commission submits that, by requiring such a statement of reasons, the Court of First Instance contradicts the Court of Justice’s settled case-law on that matter.", "37.", "The Commission contends that the involvement of Wam in intra-Community trade shows by itself the effect that the subsidy could have on that trade.", "38.", "Challenging paragraphs 73 and 74 of the judgment under appeal which criticise the lack of sufficient evidence in the contested decision of the strengthening of Wam’s position with regard to competition, the Commission argues that, according to the case-law of the Court, when an aid releases an undertaking from costs which it usually has to bear and strengthens its position compared with other competitors in intra-Community trade, it influences trade and generally distorts competition.", "In that regard, the Commission stresses that it is not obliged to examine the actual consequences of the aid.", "39.", "The Commission criticises the judgment under appeal to the extent that it finds a failure to state reasons in the fact that the contested decision does not contain any arguments concerning the interdependence between the Comunity and Far Eastern markets affected by the aid at issue.", "According to the Commission, the Court ignored the obvious consideration that money is fungible and therefore, when an undertaking carries out an activity within the Community, it is not necessary to specifically demonstrate the possibility that the aid intended to support the external market penetration also has an effect on trade between Member States and is likely to give rise to distortion of competition.", "40.", "Finally, the Commission relies on the case-law of the Court of Justice, according to which, when it is apparent from the very circumstances in which the aid is granted that the aid is capable of affecting trade between Member States and distorting or threatening to distort competition, the Commission may confine itself to setting out those circumstances in the statement of reasons for its decision.", "According to the Commission, that is precisely what it did in the contested decision.", "41.", "Wam argues that the appeal is wholly unfounded.", "According to Wam, the Court of First Instance was correct to apply the settled case-law of the Court of Justice, according to which the obligation to state reasons has not been fulfilled by a statement of reasons based on abstract or merely hypothetical assessments.", "Wam argues that the conditions regarding the effect on trade and the distortion of competition can be considered fulfilled only on the grounds of findings of fact which prove, in a specific and not merely abstract manner, how, in the circumstances of the case, an intervention by the State or through State resources strengthens the competitive position of the beneficiary undertaking and reduces its production costs.", "42.", "According to the Italian Republic, the Court of First Instance did not infringe Article 87(1) EC and followed the general trend of the case-law.", "Case 730/79 Philip Morris Holland v Commission [1980] ECR 2671 defined the effect on trade as meaning that the subsidy should ‘strengthen the position of an undertaking compared with other undertakings competing in intra-Community trade’.", "43.", "The Italian Republic argues that an examination, even of a general nature, of the features of the intra-Community competition potentially affected by the aid and therefore the theory of a ‘relative strengthening’, which is said to explain the effect of intra-Community trade, is exactly what is missing in the contested decision.", "The reference in paragraph 15 of the appeal to the possible strengthening effect is inadmissible, since the Court of First Instance held in paragraph 73 of the judgment under appeal that this effect was relied upon for the first time at the hearing.", "44.", "The Italian Republic relies on the same objection of inadmissibility with regard to the remark, referred to in paragraph 15 of the appeal, concerning the distorting effect on competition which allegedly flows from the fact that the undertaking, by virtue of the subsidy, was released from costs which it would normally have to bear.", "45.", "According to that Member State, paragraph 56 of Case C‑372/97 Italy v Commission [2004] ECR I‑3679 indicates that the statement of reasons is adequate when the Commission identifies, at least generally, the normal costs of the category of undertakings concerned and how they relate to the objective of the aid.", "In the present case, the reason why the expenditure constitutes ‘normal costs’ is not mentioned in the statement of reasons of the contested decision.", "46.", "Furthermore, the Italian Republic argues that the Tubemeuse judgment clearly indicates that one cannot presume that any advantage obtained in the field of competition outside the Community is also advantageous in the field of Community competition.", "The Court of First Instance was therefore entitled to hold that there is a lack of reasoning in that regard.", "47.", "Finally, the Italian Republic submits that the Commission’s arguments that the Court of First Instance did not take into account the fungible quality of money is inadmissible since it falls outside the scope of the plea alleging that the contested decision is insufficiently reasoned and is an additional reasoning to that contained in the contested decision.", "In any event, the ‘releasing of resources’ theory does not constitute an adequate statement of reasons in the absence of additional information, since it could just as well establish that the aid at issue does not have any effect on the Community market.", "Findings of the Court", "48.", "According to settled case-law, the statement of reasons required by Article 253 EC must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the Court to carry out its review.", "It is not necessary for the reasoning to go into all the relevant facts and points of law, since the question whether the statement of reasons meets the requirements of Article 253 EC must be assessed with regard not only to its wording but also to its context and to all the legal rules governing the matter in question (Case C‑88/03 Portugal v Commission [2006] ECR I‑7115, paragraph 88 and the case-law cited).", "49.", "Applied to the classification of a measure as aid, that principle requires a statement of the reasons for which the Commission considers that the measure concerned falls within the scope of Article 87(1) EC.", "In that regard, even in cases where it is apparent from the circumstances under which it was granted that the aid is liable to affect trade between Member States and to distort or threaten to distort competition, the Commission must at least set out those circumstances in the statement of reasons for its decision (see Portugal v Commission , paragraph 89 and the case-law cited).", "50.", "In that context, it should be noted that, also according to settled case-law, for the purpose of categorising a national measure as State aid, it is not necessary to demonstrate that the aid has a real effect on trade between Member States and that competition is actually being distorted, but only to examine whether that aid is liable to affect such trade and distort competition (Case C-222/04 Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others [2006] ECR I‑289, paragraph 140 and the case-law cited).", "51.", "With regard more specifically to the condition that trade between Member States be affected, it follows from the case-law that the grant of aid by a Member State, in the form of a tax relief, to some of its taxable persons must be regarded as likely to have an effect on trade and, consequently, as meeting that condition, where those taxable persons perform an economic activity in the field of such trade or it is conceivable that they are in competition with operators established in other Member States  (see Portugal v Commission , paragraph 91, and Case C‑172/03 Heiser [2005] ECR I‑1627, paragraph 35).", "52.", "Furthermore, the Court has held that, when aid granted by a Member State strengthens the position of an undertaking compared with other undertakings competing in intra-Community trade, the latter must be regarded as influenced by that aid (Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others , paragraph 141 and the case-law cited).", "53.", "In that regard, the fact that an economic sector has been liberalised at Community level may serve to determine that the aid has a real or potential effect on competition and affects trade between Member States  (Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others , paragraph 142 and the case-law cited).", "54.", "With regard to the condition of the distortion of competition, it should be borne in mind in that regard that, in principle, aid intended to release an undertaking from costs which it would normally have to bear in its day-to-day management or normal activities distorts the conditions of competition  (see Case C‑156/98 Germany v Commission [2000] ECR I‑6857, paragraph 30, and Heiser , paragraph 55).", "55.", "In the circumstances of the present case, it must be held that the Court of First Instance did not infringe the case-law cited above concerning the Commission’s obligation to state reasons in matters of State aid by holding in paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal that the reasoning provided in recitals 74 to 79 of the contested decision does not make it possible to understand how, in the circumstances of the present case, the aid at issue was likely to affect trade between Member States and to distort or threaten to distort competition.", "56.", "Regarding the specific circumstances of the present case, the Court of First Instance correctly points out, in particular in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, that the aid at issue is intended to finance, by means of loans at reduced rates, expenses for market penetration programmes in non-member States concerning the establishment of permanent structures or for trade promotion and that the grant equivalent is relatively small in amount.", "Furthermore, in paragraph 75 of the judgment, the Court of First Instance underlined that the aid is not intended directly and immediately to support exports to outside the EU, but to finance a market penetration programme.", "57.", "In light of the specific circumstances of the case, the Court of First Instance did not err in law by holding, in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission is, in particular, obliged to examine whether the aid at issue is liable to affect trade between Member States and to distort competition, giving information relevant to their likely effects in the contested decision.", "58.", "In that regard, in paragraph 64 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance rightly explained that it would suffice that the Commission show correctly how the aid at issue was likely to affect trade between Member States and to distort or threaten to distort competition.", "The Court of First Instance notably stressed in that context that the Commission was not obliged to carry out an economic analysis of the actual situation of the relevant market or the patterns of the trade in question between Member States or to show the real effect of the aid at issue, in particular on the prices applied by Wam, or to examine Wam’s sales on the United Kingdom market.", "59.", "With regard to the practical implementation of those principles, the Court of First Instance was right to hold, in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal, that a general reasoning such as that contained in recitals 75 and 77 of the contested decision, which is based on the reaffirmation of the principles flowing from the Tubermeuse judgment cannot, by itself, be considered to satisfy the requirements arising under Article 253 EC.", "60.", "Regarding the reasons set out at recitals 76 and 78 to the contested decision, the Court of First Instance, without erring in law, held, in paragraphs 68 to 74 of the judgment under appeal, that those recitals, even when read in combination with the principles set out in recital 75 of the contested decision and with the finding that the financial situation of Wam has improved are not sufficient to permit an understanding of how the aid at issue is liable, in the present case, to affect trade between Member States and to distort or threaten to distort competition in that sector.", "61.", "Contrary to the claim of the Commission in that respect, the mere fact that Wam took part in intra-Community trade by exporting an important part of its production within the EU cannot suffice, in the particular circumstances of the case recalled in paragraph 55 of this judgment, to demonstrate those effects.", "62.", "In that context, it should be noted, in particular, that although it follows from the case-law cited in paragraphs 50 and 53 of this judgment that such effects can, in principle, result from the fact that the beneficiary of an aid is active on a liberalised European market, the fact remains that in the circumstances of this case and contrary to the circumstances giving rise to those cases,  the aid at issue is not directly connected to the activity of the beneficiary on that market, but is intended to finance expenditure for a non-member State market penetration programme.", "In those circumstances, and all the more when it involves aid, the grant equivalent of which was of relatively low value, the effect of the aid on trade and on intra-Community competition is less immediate and even less discernible and this requires a greater effort to state reasons on the part of the Commission.", "63.", "Finally, as to the case-law cited in paragraph 54 of this judgment, according to which, in principle, the aid which is intended to release an undertaking from costs which it would normally have had to bear in its day-to-day management or normal activities distorts the conditions of competition, it is sufficient to note that the aid at issue is not in fact intended to release Wam from such costs.", "64.", "It follows from the above that the Court of First Instance, when it held in substance in paragraphs 62 to 76 of the judgment under appeal that the Commission should have carried out a more detailed analysis of the potential consequences of the aid at issue on intra-Community trade and on competition and should have given additional information, in the contested decision, concerning those effects, did not intend to depart from the case-law cited above but to take into account the specific circumstances of the case, and it cannot be accused of erring in law in this respect.", "65.", "Furthermore, that conclusion is not invalidated by the arguments advanced by the Commission with regard to the findings of the Court of First Instance in paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal.", "Those findings on the examination of the interdependence between EU and Far Eastern markets relate to the possibility of an indirect effect on trade and intra-Community competition, such as that referred to principally in the Tubemeuse judgement.", "While it is true that the examination of such interdependence cannot be required if it is demonstrated that the State aid directly affects the intra-Community markets, it must however be held that the contested decision, as has been confirmed in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment, does not adequately demonstrate this.", "66.", "It follows from all the above considerations that the appeal must be dismissed.", "Costs", "67.", "Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, which applies to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 118 of those rules, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs, if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "The Italian Republic and Wam have applied for costs and as the Commission has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay the costs at both instances.", "Operative part", "On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:", "1.", "Dismisses the appeal;", "2.", "Orders the Commission of

contested decision’).", "Legal framework and factual background", "Legal framework", "2", "The legal framework of the dispute was set out in the contested judgment as follows:", "‘2 The general provisions on State aid set out in Articles 92 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 87 EC) and 93 and 94 of the EC Treaty (now Articles 88 EC and 89 EC) apply within the field of transport, subject to the special provisions of Article 77 of the EC Treaty (now Article 73 EC), which state that aids meeting the needs of coordination of transport or representing reimbursement for the discharge of certain obligations inherent in the concept of a public service are compatible with the Treaty.", "3 Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70 of 4 June 1970 on the granting of aids for transport by rail, road and inland waterway (OJ, English Special Edition 1970 (II), p. 360), as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 543/97 of 17 March 1997 (OJ 1997 L 84, p. 6), which is based on Article 75 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 71 EC) and Articles 77 and 94 of the Treaty, confirms that Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty are to apply in the field concerned.", "The regulation also lays down certain special rules on the aid in question in so far as they relate specifically to activities in that sector.", "It thus sets out the cases in and conditions on which Member States are entitled to adopt coordination measures or impose obligations inherent in the concept of a public service which involve the granting of State aid pursuant to Article 77 of the Treaty.", "4 Regarding the coordination of transport, Article 3(1)(d) of Regulation No 1107/70 authorises, until the entry into force of Community rules on access to the transport market, aid granted as an exceptional and temporary measure in order to eliminate, as part of a reorganisation plan, excess capacity causing serious structural problems, and thus to contribute towards meeting the needs of the transport market more effectively.", "5 In the course of introducing a common transport policy, the international road haulage market was partially liberalised within the Community by Council Regulation No 1018/68 of 19 July 1968 on the establishment of a Community quota for the carriage of goods by road between Member States (Journal Officiel 1968 L 175, p. 13), which introduced a quota system in 1969.", "In 1991 and 1992, for example, the Community quota consisted of 47 094 and 65 936 authorisations distributed among the various Member States in accordance with a specific formula.", "The Italian Republic was allocated 5 550 authorisations in 1991 and 7 770 in 1992.", "Community authorisations permitted their holders to carry goods between Member States for a period of one year.", "This system was kept in force up to 1 January 1993, the date on which this activity was fully liberalised by Council Regulation (EEC) No 881/92 of 26 March 1992 on access to the market in the carriage of goods by road within the Community to or from the territory of a Member State or passing across the territory of one or more Member States (OJ 1992 L 95, p. 1).", "6 Regarding the market for the carriage of goods within a Member State, Council Regulation (EEC) No 4059/89 of 21 December 1989 laying down conditions under which non-resident carriers may operate national road haulage services within a Member State (OJ 1989 L 390, p. 3) made cabotage, that is to say, the carriage of goods within one Member State by a carrier established in another Member State, subject, with effect from 1 July 1990, to a transitional system in the form of a progressively increasing Community quota.", "The total initial quota consisted of 15 000 cabotage authorisations valid for a period of two months, allocated among the Member States according to a given formula.", "Within this framework, 1 767 authorisations were allocated to the Italian Republic.", "Council Regulation (EEC) No 3118/93 of 25 October 1993 laying down conditions under which non-resident carriers may operate national road haulage services within a Member State (OJ 1993 L 279, p. 1) provided for the continuance of this transitional system, in the form of a total initial Community quota of 30 000 authorisations (including 3 520 for the Italian Republic), increasing by 30% a year until the definitive introduction of the full liberalisation of cabotage activities with effect from 1 July 1998.’", "Factual background", "3", "The facts set out in this paragraph are taken from the findings of fact made by the Court of

Friuli‑Venezia Giulia Region and the carriage of goods by road for hire or reward (“Law No 28/1981”), provided for certain aid for road haulage contractors established within that region.", "8 The system introduced by Law No 28/1981 was replaced by Regional Law No 4 of 7 January 1985 on action to promote and develop transport of concern to the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region and the carriage of goods by road for hire or reward (… hereinafter “Law No 4/1985”).", "Articles 4 to 6 of Law No 4/1985 introduced a system of regional aid that was essentially identical to the system set up by Law No

from 1985 to 1995, amounted to ITL 13 000 million (EUR 6.7 million), and 155 applications had been [accepted].", "On average, the level of aid disbursed ranged from 13% to 26% of the cost of the loans and interest.", "The budget for the period 1981 to 1985 was ITL 930 million (EUR 0.4 million), and 14 applications had been accepted during this period (section II of the contested decision).", "11 … the budget allocated for the aid covered by Article 5 of Law No 4/1985 amounted to ITL 23 300 million (EUR 11.8 million) for the period from 1985 to 1995, and 1 691 applications had been accepted, with an average financing rate of around 19%, over that period.", "In 1993, 83 applications had been accepted and the level of aid was 10%.", "From 1981 to 1985, 305 applications had been [granted] and aid amounting to ITL 5 790 million (EUR 2.9 million) had been disbursed (contested decision, section II).", "12 According to the information sent by the Italian Government to the Commission [of the European Communities] after the initiation of the administrative procedure, aid granted under Article 6 of Law No 4/1985 was for investment in the combined transport sector (section II, seventh paragraph, of the contested decision).", "According to the contested decision (point VIII, seventh paragraph), that aid was between 10% to 15% of the total amount of aid allocated.", "…", "16 By letter of 14 February 1997 the Commission informed the Italian Government of its decision to initiate the procedure provided by Article 93(2) of the Treaty in respect of the system of aid for commercial road hauliers laid down by Law No 4/1985 and Law No 28/1981 (OJ 1997 C 98, p. 16).", "It asked the Italian authorities and interested third parties to submit their observations and furnish all documents, information and data required in order to examine the compatibility of the aid in question with the common market.", "The Commission received the Italian Government’s observations on 3 April 1997 …", "17 On 30 July 1997, the Commission closed the proceeding by adopting the contested decision. …’", "4 Section VI of the reasons for the contested decision states that, since the aid in dispute seeks to improve the competitive position of commercial road haulage companies in the Friuli‑Venezia Giulia Region (hereinafter ‘the Region’), by reducing their normal business running costs, whereas such costs have to be borne in full by their competitors outside the region, it benefited those companies and that specific activity in such a way that it was liable to produce a distortion of competition.", "5 First, the Commission makes a distinction, in section VII, third to eleventh paragraphs, of the reasons for the contested decision, between the road haulage market at local, regional and national level, on the one hand, and the international road haulage market, on the other.", "It points out that the former was not open to Community competition until Regulation No 4059/89 entered into force on 1 July 1990.", "Consequently, aid granted before that date to carriers operating exclusively at local, regional or national level could not affect intra‑Community trade and therefore did not constitute State aid for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.", "However, aid granted to those carriers after that date is State aid for the purposes of that provision, since it was capable of affecting trade between Member States.", "6 With regard to the international road haulage market, the Commission states, in section III, fourth paragraph, of the reasons for the contested decision, that it has been open to intra‑Community competition since 1969, when Regulation No 1018/68 entered into force.", "It infers from this, in section VII, last paragraph, of those reasons, that the aid provided for by Laws Nos 28/1981 and 4/1985 had strengthened the financial position and hence the scope of commercial haulage companies in the Region vis-à-vis their competitors since 1969 for companies engaged in international transport and was accordingly capable of affecting trade between Member States.", "That aid therefore constitutes State aid for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty and the local or limited nature of the competition represented by the regional hauliers cannot preclude the application of that provision.", "7 Next, in examining, in section VIII, ninth paragraph, of the contested decision, whether the aid thus characterised as State aid qualifies for a derogation, the Commission considers that the aid granted under Article 6 of Law No 4/1985 for financing equipment designed for combined transport can benefit from the exemption provided for in Article 3(1)(e) of Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70.", "None of the other derogations provided for by that article or by the Treaty was applicable to the other aid granted by the Region.", "8 Finally, section VIII, last paragraph, of the reasons for the contested decision states that aid granted under Laws Nos 28/1981 and 4/1985 to commercial road haulage companies in the Region engaged in local, regional or national transport operations from 1 July 1990 onwards, as well as to those engaged in international transport operations, is incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 of the Treaty.", "The Commission therefore concludes, in section IX of those reasons, that, since the Italian Government implemented the aid scheme in question without having fulfilled the obligation to notify it, the scheme should be regarded as illegal and recovery of the aid in question should be regarded as necessary in order to restore the fair conditions of competition which existed before that aid was granted.", "9", "The operative part of the contested decision is worded as follows:", "‘Article 1", "Subsidies granted under Laws No 28/1981 and No 4/1985 of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region (hereinafter referred to as “the subsidies”) up to 1 July 1990 to companies exclusively engaged in transport operations at local, regional or national level do not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.", "Article 2", "The subsidies not covered by Article 1 of this Decision constitute aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the Treaty and are illegal since they were introduced in breach of Article 93(3).", "Article 3", "The subsidies for financing equipment specifically adapted for, and used solely for, combined transport constitute aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the Treaty but are compatible with the common market by virtue of Article 3(1)(e) of Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70.", "Article 4", "The subsidies granted from 1 July 1990 onwards to companies engaged in transport operations at a local, regional or national level and to companies engaged in transport operations at an international level are incompatible with the common market since they do not fulfil any of the conditions for derogation provided for in Article 92(2) and (3) of the Treaty, or the conditions provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70.", "Article 5", "Italy shall abolish and recover the aid referred to in Article 4.", "The aid shall be reimbursed in accordance with the provisions of domestic law, together with interest, calculated by applying the reference rates used for assessment of regional aid, as from the date on which the aid was granted and ending on the date on which it is actually repaid.", "…", "Article 7", "This Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.’", "10 Following the adoption of the contested decision, the Region, which had suspended the granting of the aid in question from 1 January 1996 onwards, abolished the system of aid provided for by Law No 4/1985 and took the steps necessary to recover the aid already disbursed.", "Procedure, forms of order sought and pleas in law before the Court of First Instance and the contested judgment", "11 It was in those circumstances that, by applications lodged at the Registry of the Court of First Instance on 2 December 1997 (T‑298/97), 11 December 1997 (T‑312/97 and T‑313/97), 16 December 1997 (T‑315/97), 19 December 1997 (T‑600/97 to T‑607/97), 2 January 1998 (T‑1/98), 5 January 1998 (T‑3/98 to T‑6/98) and 26 January 1998 (T‑23/98), certain of the undertakings in receipt of the aid in question brought an action for the partial annulment of the contested decision.", "12 By order of the President of the Fourth Chamber (Extended Composition) of 29 September 1998, the Italian Republic was granted leave to intervene in support of the applicant undertakings at first instance (hereinafter ‘the applicants’).", "13 The Italian Republic also brought an action, by application lodged at the Registry of the Court of Justice on 28 October 1997, registered under number C‑372/97, for the partial annulment of the contested decision or, in the alternative, the annulment of that decision only in so far as, in Article 5, it requires that Member State to recover the aid granted from 1 July 1990 onwards.", "Those proceedings were stayed, by order of the Court of 24 November 1998, pending delivery of the contested judgment.", "14 By their actions before the Court of First Instance, the applicants claimed that the Court should partially annul the contested decision or, in the alternative, annul it only in so far as, in Article 5, it requires the Italian Republic to recover the aid granted from 1 July 1990 onwards, together with interest.", "In support of their claims, they put forward essentially four pleas for annulment.", "15 The first plea for annulment put forward alleged infringement of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.", "The applicants maintained that the Commission had erred in law by merely mentioning the simple possibility that trade between Member States might be affected, without demonstrating the existence of a real, concrete risk of distortion of competition.", "In this case, since the aid in question was of a modest amount, its recipients engaged in mainly regional operations and it had a compensatory function, that aid was not likely to affect trade between Member States or affect competition.", "The applicants also complained that the contested decision was vitiated by a failure to state reasons.", "16 The Court of First Instance rejected that first plea in law on the grounds specified in paragraphs 76 to 106 of the contested judgment.", "It is apparent from those grounds, inter alia, that, on the one hand, the Commission was not required to establish that the aid in question had a real effect on trade between Member States and competition, and that, on the other hand, neither the allegedly trivial amount of that aid nor the relatively small size of the recipient undertakings and the fact that they operate at a local level necessarily led to the conclusion that the aid in question had no effect on the market and intra‑Community trade.", "Moreover, the complaint concerning inadequacy of the statement of reasons for the contested decision was also rejected by the Court of First Instance on the ground that, in that decision, the Commission had stated, concisely but clearly, the reasons why the aid in question was such as to affect trade between Member States and distort competition.", "17 The second plea for annulment put forward by the applicants alleged, firstly, infringement by the Commission of Articles 92(3)(a) and (c) of the Treaty and 3(1)(d) of Regulation No 1107/70 so far as concerns the interpretation of the derogating provisions of those articles and, secondly, failure to state reasons for the contested decision in that regard.", "18 The Court of First Instance rejected that second plea, holding, in paragraphs 124 to 135 of the contested judgment, that the contested decision cannot be regarded as vitiated by an error of law on that point or, moreover, by a failure to state reasons.", "19 The third plea for annulment put forward by the applicants maintained that, since the aid in question had been instituted by laws predating the liberalisation of the transport sector, it should not be classified as new aid, but should be regarded as existing aid.", "20", "The Court of First Instance upheld that plea only in so far as it relates to aid granted to undertakings engaged solely in local, regional or national transport and rejected it so far as concerns those operating in the international road haulage sector.", "The grounds on which the Court of First Instance based its reasoning are the following:", "‘142 According to established case-law, existing aid is aid introduced before the Treaty came into force or before the accession of the Member State concerned to the European Communities and aid which has been properly put into effect under the conditions laid down in Article 93(3) of the Treaty ([Case C‑387/92] Banco Exterior de España [[1994] ECR I‑877], paragraph 19, and Case C‑295/97 Piaggio [1999] ECR I-3735, paragraph 48).", "143 Likewise, a system of aid established in a market that was initially closed to competition must, when that market is liberalised, be regarded as an existing aid system, since at the time of its establishment it did not come within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty, which, having regard to the requirements set out in that provision regarding effect on trade between Member States and repercussions on competition, applies only to sectors open to competition.", "…", "145 In the present case, as the international road haulage sector had been opened up to competition by Regulation No 1018/68 with effect from 1969, the systems of aid in question, established in 1981 and 1985, came within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty from the time of their introduction and should therefore be regarded as new systems of aid which should thus have been notified to the Commission pursuant to Article 93(3) of the Treaty.", "146 On the other hand, as the cabotage market was liberalised by Regulation No 4059/89 only from 1 July 1990, the systems of aid in question did not, at the time of their introduction in 1981 and 1985, come within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty, as regards aid granted in the local, regional or national transport sector.", "147 It follows that aid to undertakings engaged solely in such a type of transport must be classified as existing aid and can be the subject, if at all, only of a decision finding it incompatible as to the future.", "148 Pursuant to Article 93(1) and (2) of the Treaty and in accordance with the principle of legal certainty, the Commission is, as part of its constant review of existing aid, only empowered to require the elimination or modification of such aid within a period which it is to determine.", "That aid can, therefore, lawfully be implemented as long as the Commission has not found it to be incompatible with the common market (Case C-47/91 Italy v Commission [1992] ECR I-4145, paragraphs 23 and 25, and Banco Exterior de España, cited above, paragraph 20).", "…", "150 The contested decision must therefore be annulled in so far as Article 2 thereof declares aid granted with effect from 1 July 1990 to undertakings engaged solely in local, regional or national transport to be illegal, and in so far as Article 5 requires recovery of that aid.’", "21 The fourth plea for annulment put forward by the applicants was based on the fact that Article 4, to which Article 5 of the contested decision refers in providing for the recovery of aid incompatible with the Treaty, unequivocally finds that the aid disbursed from 1 July 1990, a date which applies not only to aid granted to undertakings engaged exclusively in local, regional or national transport, but also to aid granted to those engaged in international road haulage, was incompatible with the common market.", "They complain that the Commission acted in breach both of the principles of proportionality and the protection of legitimate expectations and of the obligation to state reasons so far as the recovery of the aid is concerned.", "22 The Court of First Instance also rejected that plea in law, on the grounds set out in paragraphs 162 to 177 of the contested judgment, which are based on the consideration that Article 4 of the contested decision must be interpreted as covering the aid granted to undertakings engaged in local, regional or national transport from 1 July 1990 onwards and that granted to undertakings engaged in international road haulage since the introduction of the aid systems in question.", "23 The Court of First Instance also held that, since the aid in question had not been notified to the Commission, the applicants had not established the existence of any specific factor which would give grounds for assuming that the obligation to reimburse individual aid granted to undertakings engaged in international road haulage was, in view of the effect of such aid on competition, manifestly disproportionate to the objectives of the Treaty or any exceptional circumstance of such a kind as to create legitimate expectations as to the lawfulness of such aid paid to undertakings engaged in international road haulage.", "It also concluded that the statement of reasons for the contested decision is adequate in that regard.", "24", "The operative part of the contested judgment is worded as follows:", "‘1.", "Annuls Article 2 of Commission Decision 98/182/EC of 30 July 1997 concerning aid granted by the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region (Italy) to road haulage companies in the Region in so far as it declares illegal aid granted after 1 July 1990 to undertakings engaged exclusively in local, regional or national transport;", "2.", "Annuls Article 5 of Decision 98/182 in so far as it requires the Italian Republic to recover that aid;", "3.", "Dismisses the remainder of the application;", "4.", "Orders each party to bear its own costs.’", "The appeal", "25", "By its appeal, the Italian Republic claims that the Court should:", "– partially set aside the contested judgment;", "– in the alternative, annul the contested decision in so far as it imposes the obligation to recover the subsidies granted, together with interest;", "– order the Commission to pay the costs.", "26", "The Commission contends that the Court should:", "– dismiss the appeal;", "– set aside the contested judgment or, in the alternative, set it aside in so far as it partially annulled the contested decision;", "– order the Italian Republic and Impresa Edo Collorigh and Others (hereinafter ‘Collorigh and Others’), which were among the applicants at first instance, to pay the costs.", "27", "In the pleading which they filed in response to the notification of the appeal, Collorigh and Others claim in essence that the Court should:", "–", "set aside the contested judgment in so far as it:", "– finds incompatible with the common market the aid granted to undertakings engaged in international road haulage operations which received subsidies granted pursuant to Laws Nos 28/1981 and 4/1985;", "– classifies as ‘new aid’ the subsidies paid to undertakings which engaged in international road haulage operations during the period from 1981 to 1995;", "– orders the competent authorities of the Italian Republic to recover the allegedly illegal aid;", "– in the alternative, annul the contested decision in so far as it imposes the obligation to recover the subsidies granted, together with interest;", "– in the further alternative, annul the contested decision by limiting to the minimum amount the obligation to refund, taking account of the profit actually made by the undertakings concerned and of the tax burdens on them.", "The cross‑appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "28 By its cross‑appeal, which must be examined first, the Commission claims that the Court of First Instance infringed both its obligation to satisfy itself of its own motion as to the admissibility of the actions brought at first instance and the fourth paragraph of Article 173 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC), which lays down the criterion of individual concern.", "In the Commission’s view, the Court of First Instance should have held that those actions had to be declared inadmissible for lack of any such individual concern, since the applicants are unable to rely either on any attributes peculiar to them or on any circumstances by which they are distinguished from all other actual or potential recipients of the aid in question.", "29 Taking the view that the contested decision is a measure of general application, the Commission claims that it is not of individual concern to the applicants which are undertakings which have not claimed and cannot claim the slightest specific factor by which they are distinguished from other interested undertakings which did not participate in the formal procedure for reviewing the aid in question.", "More specifically, that decision did not infringe any of those applicants’ specific rights which were different from those of other undertakings in receipt of that aid.", "30 In the Commission’s view, that analysis is confirmed by the case‑law (see, inter alia, Case 282/85 DEFI v Commission [1986] ECR 2469 and Joined Cases 67/85, 68/85 and 70/85 Van der Kooy and Others v Commission [1988] ECR 219) and is not invalidated by the judgment in Joined Cases C‑15/98 and C‑105/99 Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission [2000] ECR I‑8855).", "In particular, the undertaking concerned in the case which gave rise to the latter judgment was in a different position, since it was not only affected by the Commission’s decision by virtue of being a potential beneficiary of the aid scheme, ‘but also by virtue of being an actual beneficiary of individual aid granted under that scheme, the recovery of which has been ordered by the Commission’.", "31 The Commission points out, inter alia, that, firstly, the order for recovery of the aid already paid out is only one of the aspects of the contested decision, which continues to apply to all recipients, including those which are only potentially so.", "It maintains, secondly, that it will be possible to determine the actual existence of an obligation imposed on each undertaking to repay the aid received only at the conclusion of complex investigations.", "Finally, if all the undertakings which received aid granted under schemes declared illegal and incompatible with the common market and recovery of which was ordered by a Commission decision were allowed to bring actions contesting that decision before the Court of First Instance, in cases where those undertakings did not bring actions, any reference for a preliminary ruling concerning the recovery of such aid would be declared inadmissible (see Case C‑188/92 TWD Textilwerke Deggendorf [1994] ECR I‑833, paragraphs 25 and 26).", "The Commission is of the opinion that the perverse effect of such a situation would be to oblige recipient undertakings to contest the decision before the Court of First Instance within the limited period laid down for bringing an action for annulment, even before knowing whether, under national law, they will actually be required to repay the aid received, such an effect potentially weakening the judicial protection of those undertakings.", "32 The Commission is of the view that this plea of inadmissibility constitutes a ground involving a question of public policy.", "Consequently, since the Court of First Instance should have ascertained of its own motion whether the contested decision is of individual concern to the applicants, the Court of Justice must declare such a breach of that obligation.", "In the alternative, the Commission contends that the Court of Justice should itself examine the question of the admissibility of the actions brought at first instance.", "Giving judgment in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, the latter could dismiss those actions as inadmissible.", "Findings of the Court", "33 As a preliminary point, it must be observed that the Commission has abandoned its claims made in the alternative for the contested judgment to be set aside in so far as it partially annulled the contested decision.", "34 It must be recalled that Article 173 of the Treaty, by virtue of which the Court of Justice is to review the legality of Community acts, provides that any natural or legal person may on grounds of lack of competence, infringement of an essential procedural requirement, infringement of this Treaty or of any rule of law relating to its application, or misuse of powers institute proceedings against a decision addressed to that person or against a decision which, although in the form of a regulation or a decision addressed to another person, is of direct and individual concern to the former.", "35 Where a decision is not of individual concern to a natural or legal person within the meaning of that provision, which is an essential condition for having locus standi in proceedings seeking judicial review of a Community act, such proceedings are inadmissible and that inadmissibility therefore constitutes a ground involving a question of public policy which may, and even must, be raised of its own motion by the Community judicature (see, with regard to a party having no interest in bringing or in maintaining an appeal, Case C‑19/93 P Rendo and Others v Commission [1995] ECR I‑3319, paragraph 13).", "36 According to settled case‑law, persons other than those to whom a decision is addressed may only claim to be individually concerned if that decision affects them by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons and by virtue of these factors distinguishes them individually just as in the case of the person addressed (see, inter alia, judgments in Case 25/62 Plaumann v Commission [1963] ECR 95; Case C‑321/95 P Greenpeace Council and Others v Commission [1998] ECR I‑1651, paragraphs 7 and 28, and Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission, cited above, paragraph 32).", "37 The Court has thus held that an undertaking cannot, in principle, contest a Commission decision prohibiting a sectoral aid scheme if it is concerned by that decision solely by virtue of belonging to the sector in question and being a potential beneficiary of the scheme.", "Such a decision is, vis-à-vis the undertaking should it seek to contest the decision, a measure of general application covering situations which are determined objectively and entails legal effects for a class of persons envisaged in a general and abstract manner (Van der Kooy and Others v Commission, cited above, paragraph 15; Case C-6/92 Federmineraria and Others v Commission [1993] ECR I‑6357, paragraph 14, and Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission, paragraph 33).", "38 However, it is appropriate to recall the position adopted by the Court in the judgment in Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission with regard to Commission Decision 98/95/EC of 21 October 1997 concerning aid granted by the Region of Sardinia (Italy) to shipping companies in Sardinia (OJ 1998 L 20, p. 30), which required the Italian Republic to recover from each beneficiary of the loans and leases in question the element of aid which they contained.", "In paragraphs 34 and 35 of that judgment, the Court held that, since Sardegna Lines was not only concerned by Decision 98/95 by virtue of being an undertaking in the shipping sector in Sardinia and a potential beneficiary of the aid scheme for Sardinian shipowners, but also by virtue of being an actual beneficiary of individual aid granted under that scheme, the recovery of which had been ordered by the Commission, it was individually concerned by that decision and its action directed against that decision was admissible.", "39 Contrary to what the Commission claims, that is precisely the case here, since the applicants are in a different position from that of applicants for whom a Commission decision is in the nature of a measure of general application.", "The former are not only concerned by the contested decision by virtue of being undertakings in the road haulage sector in the region and potential beneficiaries of the aid scheme in question, but also by virtue of being actual recipients of individual aid granted under that scheme, the recovery of which has been ordered by the Commission .", "As paragraphs 10 and 11 of the contested judgment show, the number of applications accepted and the amount budgeted for the aid in question during the periods from 1981 to 1985 and from 1985 to 1995 were specified in section II of the reasons for the contested decision and the Commission must therefore have known of the existence of those actual recipients.", "40 Since it follows from the foregoing that, in this case, the actions brought by the applicants were admissible, the Court of First Instance did not err in law by not raising of its own motion, as a ground of inadmissibility, the point that those applicants were not individually concerned by the contested decision.", "41 Accordingly, the Commission’s cross‑appeal must be dismissed as unfounded.", "Substance", "42 In support of its appeal, the Italian Republic raises two pleas in law.", "By its first plea, it claims essentially that the Court of First Instance infringed Article 92(1) of the Treaty.", "By the first part of that plea, it submits that the Court of First Instance erred in law in interpreting that provision.", "By the second and third parts of that plea, it maintains that it was as a consequence of an error of assessment that the Court of First Instance held that the aid granted to undertakings engaged in international road haulage (hereinafter ‘the aid in dispute’) affected intra‑Community trade and competition and must therefore be regarded as new systems of aid and subject, as such, to the obligation to notify laid down in Article 93(3) of the Treaty.", "By the fourth part of that plea, it maintains that the contested judgment is vitiated by an inadequate statement of reasons as regards the effect of the aid in dispute on that trade.", "By its second plea, concerning the demand for recovery of that aid, the Italian Republic alleges that the Court of First Instance made an error of assessment and acted in breach of the principles of proportionality and the protection of legitimate expectations.", "The first plea in law", "The first part of the first plea in law, alleging that the Court of First Instance erred in law in interpreting Article 92(1) of the Treaty", "– Arguments of the parties", "43 The Italian Republic and Collorigh and Others maintain that the Court of First Instance erred in law by holding that Article 92(1) of the Treaty must not be restrictively interpreted as requiring that the aid referred to by that provision have a real, concrete effect on intra‑Community trade.", "In their view, the Court of First Instance should have interpreted it as requiring that the Commission establish and specify in concrete terms whether any undertakings had suffered harm and, if so, how many were concerned.", "44 However, in the Commission’s view, it was not required, any more than the Court of First Instance was so required, to ascertain whether the aid measures had, in reality, harmed other Community undertakings.", "No such examination is required either by the wording of Article 92 of the Treaty, which simply makes reference to a threat of distortion of competition, or by the scheme of that provision.", "Moreover, such an examination is almost impossible to carry out, in particular in fragmented markets characterised by the presence of a very large number of operators.", "– Findings of the Court", "45 It must be noted in that regard that Article 92(1) of the Treaty defines the aid regulated by it as being any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods, in so far as it affects trade between Member States.", "46 The procedural rules laid down by the Treaty vary depending on whether aid is existing aid or new aid.", "47 With regard to existing aid, under the provisions of Article 93(1) and (2) of the Treaty and in accordance with the principle of legal certainty, in the context of its constant review of such aid, if, after giving notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments, the Commission finds that that aid is not compatible with the common market having regard to Article 92 of the Treaty, or that such aid is being misused, it is to decide that the State concerned must abolish or alter such aid within a period of time to be determined by the Commission.", "Such aid may therefore be lawfully put into effect as long as the Commission has not found it to be incompatible (see judgments in Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraphs 23 and 25, and Banco Exterior de España, cited above, paragraph 20).", "48 With regard to new aid, Article 93(3) of the Treaty provides that the Commission is to be informed, in sufficient time to enable it to submit its comments, of any plans to grant or alter aid.", "It then undertakes an initial examination of the planned aid.", "If, following that examination, it considers that any such plan is not compatible with the common market, it must without delay initiate the procedure provided for in paragraph 2 of that article.", "In such circumstances, the Member State concerned must not put its proposed measures into effect until the procedure has resulted in a final decision.", "New aid is therefore subject to a precautionary review by the Commission and may not, in principle, be put into effect until such time as the latter has declared it compatible with the Treaty.", "49 As the Court of First Instance held inter alia, in paragraphs 77 to 79 of the contested judgment, in the course of the Commission’s assessment of new aid which, pursuant to Article 93(3) of the Treaty, is to be notified to it before being put into effect, the Commission is required to establish, not whether such aid has a real impact on trade between Member States and on competition, but whether that aid could affect that trade.", "If the Commission had to demonstrate in its decision the real effect of aid already granted, such a requirement would have the effect of favouring Member States which grant aid in breach of the obligation to notify laid down in Article 93(3) of the Treaty, to the detriment of those which do notify aid at the planning stage (Case C-301/87 France v Commission [1990] ECR I-307, ‘Boussac Saint Frères’, paragraphs 32 and 33).", "50 Consequently, the Court of First Instance was fully entitled to hold, in paragraph 95 of the contested judgment, that it was not necessary to establish that certain Community undertakings had been adversely affected by the granting of the aid in dispute.", "This first part of the first plea, alleging that the Court of First Instance erred in law in interpreting Article 92(1) of the Treaty, must therefore be rejected as unfounded.", "The second part of the first plea in law, relating to the impact of the aid in dispute on intra‑Community trade and competition", "– Arguments of the parties", "51 The Italian Republic and Collorigh and Others maintain that the Court of First Instance should have concluded, having regard inter alia to certain relevant documents in the file, that the aid in dispute had no impact on intra‑Community trade and competition.", "In the first place, due to the fact that, on the one hand, that aid represented a very modest total amount and, on the other hand, the road hauliers of the Region constituted a completely marginal group of the intra‑Community transport sector, the impact of that aid was bound to be absolutely insignificant.", "In the second place, the international road haulage sector, which was characterised by quotas and bilateral agreements, could not at that stage yet be regarded as being completely liberalised.", "Moreover, the Court of First Instance should have demonstrated that the Community quota in force on the international road haulage market had not been exhausted, although, in this instance, it has been.", "In the third place, in the view of Collorigh and Others, the Court of First Instance should have ruled out the possibility that the system of aid in dispute might strengthen the financial position of the recipient undertakings, since the objective of that aid was to compensate for the competition from Austrian, Croatian and Slovenian operators.", "52 The Commission contends, firstly, that the application of a system of aid which is such as to favour not only one undertaking but an entire sector, in particular where the presence of a large number of small undertakings is a feature of the market structure, is bound to affect trade.", "As the Court of First Instance rightly points out in paragraph 86 of the contested judgment, in such a context, the effects on competition and trade of even relatively modest aid may not be negligible, and such aid cannot be regarded as of little importance.", "53 Secondly, in the international road haulage sector, there existed in Italy, even before 1969, a certain degree of competition under the bilateral agreements concluded by the Italian Republic.", "In 1981 and 1985, when the systems of aid in dispute were instituted, the Community quotas allowed all hauliers in possession of the required authorisations to establish any transport link between two Member States and created or strengthened a competitive relationship between undertakings established in different Member States, as the Court of First Instance pointed out in paragraph 145 of the contested judgment.", "Indeed, on this same point, the Court of First Instance correctly stated the reasons which led it to consider that the advantages granted to the international road haulage undertakings constitute State aid for the purposes of the Treaty.", "– Findings of the Court", "54 In the first place, it should be recalled that, according to settled case‑law, the relatively small amount of aid or the relatively small size of the undertaking which receives it do not as such exclude the possibility that intra-Community trade might be affected (see Case C-142/87 Belgium v Commission [1990] ECR I-959, ‘Tubemeuse’, paragraph 43; Joined Cases C‑278/92 to C‑280/92 Spain v Commission [1994] ECR I‑4103, paragraph 42, and Case C‑280/00 Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [2003] ECR I‑7747, paragraph 81).", "Aid of a relatively small amount is liable to affect competition and trade between Member States where there is strong competition in the sector in which the undertakings which receive it operate (see Case 259/85 France v Commission [1987] ECR 4393, paragraph 24, and Case C‑351/98 Spain v Commission [2002] ECR I‑8031, paragraph 63).", "55 The Court of First Instance, having declared that that case‑law applied to the present case, was fully entitled to hold, firstly, in paragraphs 84 and 86 of the contested judgment, that the small size of the recipient undertakings and the relatively small amount of aid allocated did not mean that there was no effect on competition and trade where, as in the road haulage sector, the presence of a large number of small‑sized undertakings was a feature of the market structure.", "Secondly, as the Court of First Instance pointed out in paragraph 94 of the contested judgment, although hauliers from the Region played only a small part in that sector, the limited nature of the competition cannot preclude the application of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.", "It therefore concluded, in the same paragraph, that the aid in dispute strengthened the financial position and hence the scope of commercial haulage companies in the Region vis-à-vis their competitors and might accordingly affect trade between Member States.", "56 Since the Italian Republic has not put forward any evidence that the Court of First Instance failed, in this case, to have regard to the principles recognised by the Court of Justice in the case‑law mentioned in paragraph 54 of the present judgment, that argument concerning the impact of the aid in dispute on intra‑Community trade and competition must be rejected as unfounded.", "57 In the second place, the argument put forward by the Italian Republic and Collorigh and Others that the Court of First Instance should have concluded that the international road haulage sector, characterised as it was by the existence of quotas and bilateral agreements, could not yet be regarded as being fully liberalised on the date of the contested decision and that, consequently, the aid in dispute could not be regarded as affecting competition, must be rejected as unfounded.", "58 In paragraph 92 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance noted that, by virtue of the relevant provisions of Regulation No 1018/68, Community authorisations issued in the carrier’s name and usable only for one vehicle were granted under national quotas, for a period of one year in the case of international road haulage, holders of an international road haulage authorisation being entitled, during those periods of validity, to transport goods without limitation, with one vehicle, between Member States of their choice.", "59 The Court of First Instance was therefore fully entitled to conclude that the quota schemes in force on the international road haulage market from 1969 to 1993 allowed the introduction, within the limit of the quotas laid down, of an effective competitive situation which was capable of being affected by the grant of the aid in dispute.", "60 In that regard, the Court of First Instance was also fully entitled to hold, in paragraph 96 of the contested judgment, that, even assuming that the Community quota had been exhausted, that factor would not necessarily have led to the conclusion that the aid in dispute had no effect on intra-Community trade and competition.", "In view of the free choice given by quota schemes to holders of Community authorisations as regards the Member States between which they may provide international haulage services, exhaustion of the quotas would in any event not furnish any information as to the use made of them, in particular in the case of such haulage services from or to Italy or, more specifically, the Region.", "61 In the third place, according to settled case-law, the fact that a Member State seeks to approximate, by unilateral measures, conditions of competition in a particular sector of the economy to those prevailing in other Member States cannot deprive the measures in question of their character as aid (Joined Cases 6/69 and 11/69 Commission v France [1969] ECR 523, paragraphs 20 and 21, and Case C-6/97 Italy v Commission [1999] ECR I-2981, paragraph 21).", "62 It follows that the Court of First Instance was fully entitled to hold, in paragraph 101 of the contested judgment, that the aid in dispute could be justified neither by the existence of higher discount rates in Italy nor by competition from operators established in Austria, Croatia or Slovenia.", "The argument put forward by Collorigh and Others that the Court of First Instance should have ruled out the possibility that the system of aid in question strengthened the financial position of the recipient undertakings, since that aid was such as to compensate for that competition, must be rejected as unfounded.", "63 Accordingly, the second part of the first plea in law, relating to the impact of the aid in dispute on intra‑Community trade and competition, must be rejected in its entirety as unfounded.", "The third part of the first plea in law, alleging error of assessment of the aid in dispute as new aid", "– Arguments of the parties", "64 The Italian Republic and Collorigh and Others dispute the assessment made by the Court of First Instance in paragraph 145 of the contested judgment that, since the aid in dispute came within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty from the time of its introduction, it therefore had to be regarded as new systems of aid which should thus have been notified pursuant to Article 93(3) of the Treaty.", "In their view, the Court of First Instance should have found that such aid, which was instituted in 1981 and 1985 in a market which was not fully liberalised, had to be classified as existing aid and could be the subject only, if at all, of a decision finding it incompatible as to the future.", "65 The Commission, on the other hand, while not disputing the interpretation of existing aid adopted by the Court of First Instance in paragraphs 142 and 143 of the contested judgment, nevertheless points out that it is a very broad understanding of the concept of existing aid.", "In any event, since the aid in dispute had been instituted in 1981 and 1985 in a sector open to competition, it came within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty and had to be regarded as new aid.", "– Findings of the Court", "66 In this case, as the Court of First Instance has already correctly pointed out in paragraph 5 of the contested judgment, the international road haulage sector had already been partially opened up to Community competition from 1969 onwards by Regulation No 1018/68 and has been fully liberalised since 1 January 1993.", "67 The Court of First Instance inferred from that, in paragraph 94 of the contested judgment, that the aid in dispute strengthened the financial position and hence the scope of commercial haulage companies in the Region vis-à-vis their competitors and might accordingly affect trade between Member States.", "68 Having been instituted in 1981 and 1985, that aid therefore came within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty from the time of its introduction.", "It follows that, in finding in paragraph 145 of the contested judgment that the aid in question had therefore to be regarded as new systems of aid which should thus have been notified pursuant to Article 93(3) of the Treaty, the Court of First Instance did not err in law.", "69 Accordingly, the third part of the first plea in law, alleging an error of assessment of the aid in dispute as new aid, must be rejected.", "The fourth part of the first plea in law, alleging failure to state grounds for the contested judgment", "70 So far as concerns the fourth part of the first plea in law, alleging failure to state grounds for the contested judgment as regards the impact of the aid in dispute on intra‑Community trade, it should be pointed out that the Court of First Instance set out in detail, in paragraphs 76 to 106 of the contested judgment, the reasons which had led the Commission to take the view that such aid was liable to affect trade between Member States and distort competition.", "71 Accordingly, the fourth part of the first plea in law, alleging failure to state grounds for the contested judgment, must be rejected as unfounded.", "72 In the light of the foregoing considerations, none of the four parts of the first plea in law can be upheld and, accordingly, that plea in law must be rejected in its entirety as unfounded.", "The second plea in law", "73 By its second plea in law, which comprises three parts, the Italian Republic complains that the Court of First Instance erred in law in so far as it held that the contested decision, in requiring the recovery of the aid in dispute, together with interest, is compatible with the principles of proportionality and the protection of legitimate expectations and that it failed to have regard to the extent of the obligation to recover that aid.", "The first part of the second plea in law, alleging breach of the principle of proportionality", "– Arguments of the parties", "74 By the first part of the second plea in law, Collorigh and Others maintain that the Court of First Instance should have found that the Commission failed to provide evidence that recovery of the aid in dispute was either reasonable or necessary.", "The Italian Republic, for its part, points out that, although that aid had an insignificant impact on the situation of the recipient undertakings, its repayment would place a very heavy burden on them, liable to result in economic disaster for many of them.", "– Findings of the Court", "75 According to settled case‑law, correctly cited by the Court of First Instance in paragraph 169 of the contested judgment, abolishing unlawful aid by means of recovery is the logical consequence of a finding that it is unlawful.", "Consequently, the recovery of State aid unlawfully granted, for the purpose of restoring the previously existing situation, cannot in principle be regarded as disproportionate to the objectives of the Treaty in regard to State aids (see Tubemeuse, cited above, paragraph 66, and Case C‑169/95 Spain v Commission [1997] ECR I-135, paragraph 47).", "76 By repaying the aid, the recipient forfeits the advantage which it had enjoyed over its competitors on the market, and the situation prior to payment of the aid is restored (see Case C‑350/93 Commission v Italy [1995] ECR I‑699, paragraph 22).", "It also follows from that function of repayment of aid that, as a general rule, save in exceptional circumstances, the Commission will not exceed the bounds of its discretion, recognised by the case-law of the Court, if it asks the Member State to recover the sums granted by way of unlawful aid since it is only restoring the previous situation (see Case C‑75/97 Belgium v Commission [1999] ECR I‑3671, paragraph 66, and Case C‑310/99 Italy v Commission [2002] ECR I‑2289, paragraph 99).", "77 With regard to the argument put forward by Collorigh and Others that repayment of the aid in dispute would place a very heavy burden on the recipient undertakings, liable to cause many of them to disappear from the market and so giving rise to a serious employment and social crisis, making such recovery of the aid impossible in practice, it is sufficient to point out that the circumstances relied on by Collorigh and Others are by no means sufficient to demonstrate the impossibility of recovering the aid in dispute.", "They are merely potential internal difficulties.", "78 In accordance with the case‑law of the Court, the apprehension of internal difficulties cannot justify a failure by a Member State to comply with its obligations under Community law (see, inter alia, Case C‑404/97 Commission v Portugal [2000] ECR I‑4897, paragraph 52; Case C‑310/99 Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraph 105, and Case C‑404/00 Commission v Spain [2003] ECR I‑6695, paragraph 55).", "79 In those circumstances, the Court of First Instance was fully entitled to conclude, in paragraph 170 of the contested judgment, that no specific evidence had been put forward to show that the obligation to reimburse the aid in dispute is disproportionate to the objectives of the Treaty.", "80 Accordingly, the first part of the second plea in law, by which the Italian Republic alleges that the Court of First Instance failed to observe the principle of proportionality, must be rejected.", "The second part of the second plea in law, alleging breach of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations", "– Arguments of the parties", "81 Although the Italian Republic does not dispute the Court’s case‑law which, in general, does not permit a Member State which has granted aid incompatible with the common market to plead the legitimate expectations of the recipients in order to avoid the obligation to recover that aid, it does claim, by the second part of its second plea in law, that that principle could be reformulated, in particular in cases such as this where the measure has been applied over a very long period without giving rise to any objection and has even been lawful and compatible with the Treaty for a large proportion of that period.", "82 The Italian Republic maintains, firstly, that a limitation, by the operative part of the contested decision, of the temporal effect of the obligation to recover the aid in dispute would be justifiable in this case, since that was aid which had been instituted and paid out for more than 14 years at the time when the Commission initiated the procedure, namely in November 1995, and, secondly, that the contested judgment constitutes a reformatio in pejus of that decision, thus failing to observe the principles of the protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty.", "It is precisely to prevent the adoption of acts regarding legal and economic situations which have been consolidated over time that Article 15 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1) rightly provides that the power of the Commission to act to recover illegal aid is to be subject to a limitation period of 10 years which starts to run from the date on which the aid was granted.", "Although that provision is not applicable, ratione temporis, to this case, some helpful criteria may be drawn from it for the purpose of placing reasonable limits on the temporal scope for recovery of the aid in dispute.", "83 Collorigh and Others concur with that view, while pointing out that the assertion by the Court of First Instance in paragraph 173 of the contested judgment, that the undertakings in receipt of that aid were precluded from relying on any exceptional circumstances on the basis of which they might legitimately have assumed that aid to be lawful, and therefore from declining to repay it, is incorrect.", "In their opinion, the Court of First Instance took into account many factors which could certainly be described as exceptional circumstances.", "84 The Commission replies that, in paragraphs 172 and 173 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance rightly refused to find that there were exceptional circumstances of such a kind as to create legitimate expectations as to the lawfulness of the aid in dispute.", "85 In the Commission’s view, the Italian Republic has not put forward any convincing argument to refute that conclusion.", "First, in the absence of any limitation period, the claim that the measures had been applied for 10 or 14 years when the Commission initiated the formal review procedure is irrelevant and the reference to Article 15 of Regulation No 659/1999 is misplaced.", "Second, it is wrong to claim that the measure in question was ‘lawful and compatible with the Treaty for a long period of time’.", "On the contrary, that measure was never lawful since it was not notified.", "Moreover, when the Commission had the opportunity to examine it, it found it to be incompatible with the common market and its decision was confirmed by the contested judgment which is not criticised in that respect.", "Finally, contrary to what is claimed by the Italian Republic, that incompatibility did not occur suddenly but characterised the aid in dispute from the date on which it was instituted.", "– Findings of the Court", "86 It must be pointed out that a recipient of illegally granted aid is not precluded from relying on exceptional circumstances on the basis of which it had legitimately assumed the aid to be lawful and thus declining to refund that aid.", "If such a case is brought before a national court, it is for that court to assess the material circumstances, if necessary after obtaining a preliminary ruling on interpretation from the Court of Justice (Case C‑5/89 Commission v Germany [1990] ECR I‑3437, paragraph 16, and Case C‑310/99 Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraph 103).", "87 In the present case, the Court of First Instance first of all found, in paragraph 172 of the contested judgment, that the aid in dispute had been granted without having been notified to the Commission beforehand, contrary to the obligation imposed on Member States by Article 93(3) of the Treaty.", "88 Secondly, the Court of First was fully entitled to conclude, in the same paragraph of the contested decision, that the fact that the recipient undertakings are small undertakings cannot justify a legitimate expectation on their part as to the lawfulness of that aid.", "89 Finally, in so far as the Italian Republic claims that, since the recipient undertakings had relied on the lawfulness of aid instituted and paid out over many years, the Court of First Instance should have concluded that that long period had given rise to legitimate expectations on the part of those recipients with regard to recovery of the aid in dispute, which, as the Court of Justice has already held, justified a temporal limitation of the power held by the Commission, it is sufficient to reply that, in order to fulfil its function, such a limitation period must be fixed in advance, the fixing of its duration and the detailed rules for its application coming within the powers of the Community legislature (see, to that effect, Case 52/69 Geigy v Commission [1972] ECR 787, paragraph 21).", "On the date of the contested decision, the latter had not yet acted to fix a period of limitation in connection with the monitoring of aid granted under the Treaty, since Regulation No 659/1999, having only entered into force on 16 April 1999, does not apply to the facts of this case.", "90 However, the fundamental requirement of legal certainty has the effect of preventing the Commission from indefinitely delaying the exercise of its powers (see Geigy v Commission, cited above, paragraphs 20 and 21, and Joined Cases C‑74/00 P and C‑75/00 P Falck and Acciaierie di Bolzano v Commission [2002] ECR I‑7869, paragraph 140).", "In that regard, a delay by the Commission in deciding that an aid is illegal and must be abolished and recovered by a Member State could in certain circumstances establish a legitimate expectation on the part of the recipients of that aid so as to prevent the Commission from requiring that Member State to order the refund of the aid (see Case 223/85 RSV v Commission [1987] ECR 4617, paragraph 17).", "However, the facts of the case giving rise to that judgment were exceptional and bear no resemblance to those in the present case.", "The measure at issue in that judgment concerned a sector which had for some years been receiving State aid approved by the Commission and its object was to meet the additional costs of an operation which had already received authorised aid (Case C‑334/99 Germany v Commission [2003] ECR I‑1139, paragraph 44).", "91 In any event, in the case of State aid that has not been notified, such a delay may be imputed to the Commission only from the time when it learned of the existence of the aid incompatible with the common market.", "92 In this case, it is common ground that the Commission learned of the aid in dispute only in September 1995.", "In view, firstly, of the fact that such aid had not been authorised by the Commission and, secondly, of the fact that the Commission was not aware of the complex situation in which that aid had been granted, it was therefore necessary, before reaching a decision, to carry out an investigation.", "In those circumstances, the time which elapsed between September 1995 and the date of adoption of the contested decision, namely 30 July 1997, is reasonable.", "Consequently, the Court of First Instance cannot be considered to have failed to observe the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations in that regard.", "93 Accordingly, the second part of the second plea in law must be rejected.", "The third part of the second plea in law, relating to the extent of the obligation to recover the aid in dispute", "– Arguments of the parties", "94 By the third part of its second plea in law, the Italian Republic maintains that Article 4 of the contested decision, to which Article 5 refers in providing for recovery of the aid incompatible with the Treaty, makes no distinction between the aid to undertakings engaged in local, regional or national transport and the aid to those engaged in international road haulage and that Article 4 unequivocally finds that all the aid paid out from 1 July 1990 onwards by the Region is incompatible.", "Consequently, the principle that, in circumstances where the operative part of a decision is equivocal, it is possible to make reference to the reasons for that decision is irrelevant in this case.", "95 The Commission replies that it is not clear whether the date of 1 July 1990, mentioned in Article 4 of the contested decision, refers only to the subsidies granted to undertakings engaged in local, regional or national transport or whether it also refers to those granted to undertakings engaged in international road haulage.", "However, as the Court of First Instance correctly pointed out in paragraphs 163 and 164 of the contested judgment, the reasons for the contested decision dispel any doubt in that regard and make it clear that the temporal limit of 1 July 1990 applies only to the aid granted to the first category of undertakings and does not concern the undertakings in the second category.", "Indeed, the analysis set forth by the Court of First Instance in paragraph 165 of that judgment, which is based on taking the operative part of the contested decision as a whole into consideration, invalidates that view put forward by the Italian Republic.", "– Findings of the Court", "96 Contrary to what the Italian Republic claims, the Court of First Instance, in paragraph 163 of the contested judgment, rightly found that Article 4 of the contested decision is worded equivocally as regards the requirement of recovery, which could refer either to all the aid in dispute granted since its introduction or only to the aid granted from 1 July 1990 onwards.", "97 In any event, it should be pointed out that, in paragraph 163 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance started from the general principle that the operative part of an act is indissociably linked to the statement of reasons for it, so that, when it has to be interpreted, account must be taken of the reasons which led to its adoption (see, inter alia, Case C‑355/95 P TWD v Commission [1997] ECR I‑2549, paragraph 21, and Case C‑404/97 Commission v Portugal, cited above, paragraph 41).", "98 In that regard, in paragraphs 164 and 166 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance concluded, firstly, that, in the light of the reasons for the contested decision, and in particular section VIII, last paragraph, of those reasons, Article 4 of that decision must be interpreted as meaning that the aid granted under Laws Nos 28/1981 and 4/1985 with effect from 1 July 1990 to undertakings engaged in local, regional or national transport and that granted to undertakings engaged in international road haulage since the introduction of the aid in dispute are incompatible with the common market.", "99 Secondly, in paragraph 165 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance held that that interpretation is clear from a reading of the operative part of the contested decision taken as a whole.", "Such an analysis does not reflect an error of assessment on the part of the Court of First Instance.", "100 It follows that the third part of the second plea in law, relating to the extent of the obligation to recover the aid in dispute, must be rejected.", "101 In the light of the foregoing considerations, the second plea in law in support of the appeal must be rejected in its entirety.", "102 Since none of the pleas in law put forward by the Italian Republic in support of its appeal can be upheld, the appeal must be dismissed.", "Costs", "103 Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, which applies to the appeal procedure by virtue of Article 118 of those Rules, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "However, under the first subparagraph of Article 69(3) of those Rules, where each party succeeds on some and fails on other heads, the Court may order that the parties bear their own costs.", "Since the Italian Republic and Collorigh and Others have failed in their pleas in

Commission (T‑461/12, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2014:758), by which the General Court, first, annulled Commission Decision C(2012) 1012 final of 22 February 2012 on State aid No SA.27585 and

2006 (‘the 2006 schedule’), and, secondly, dismissed the action as to the remainder.", "Background to the dispute", "2", "Lübeck Airport was operated until 31 December 2012 by Flughafen Lübeck GmbH (‘FL’).", "Until 30 November 2005, FL was wholly owned by the applicant at first instance, Hansestadt Lübeck (City of Lübeck).", "From 1 December 2005 until the end of October 2009, the private New Zealand company Infratil owned 90% of FL and the City of Lübeck owned 10%.", "From November 2009, FL was again wholly owned by the City of Lübeck.", "On 1 January 2013, Lübeck Airport was sold to

of the Luftverkehrs-Zulassungs-Ordnung (Air Traffic Licensing Rules) of 19 June 1964 (BGBl.", "I, p. 370), in the version in force in 2006 (‘the LuftVZO’), FL adopted the 2006 schedule, which was

concluded between the airport operator and an airline.", "4", "In 2007, the Commission adopted a decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure in relation to a contract concluded between FL

inter alia, that the 2006 schedule could also itself contain State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, the Commission, by the decision at issue, initiated the formal investigation procedure provided for in Article 108(2) TFEU in respect of various measures relating to Lübeck Airport, including that schedule.", "Proceedings before the General Court and the order under appeal", "6", "By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 19 October 2012, FL brought an action for annulment of the decision at issue in so far as (i) it initiates the formal investigation procedure in relation to the 2006 schedule and (ii) it requires the Federal Republic of Germany to reply to the information injunction in relation to that schedule.", "7", "In its reply, lodged at the Court Registry on 20 February 2013, the City of Lübeck stated that it was taking the place of FL in order to pursue the action brought by FL.", "8", "In support of its first head of claim, the City of Lübeck put forward five pleas in law alleging: (i) infringement of the rights of defence of the Federal Republic of Germany; (ii) infringement of the obligation to carry out a diligent and impartial examination; (iii) infringement of Article 108(2) and (3) TFEU and Articles 4, 6 and 13(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of

the first head of claim was admissible, finding, first, that FL was directly and individually concerned by the decision at issue and therefore had locus standi when the action was brought and, secondly, that FL had retained a legal interest in bringing proceedings after Lübeck Airport was sold.", "As to the merits, it upheld the fourth plea, holding that the decision at issue was vitiated by a manifest error of assessment inasmuch as the Commission had found in it that the advantages established by the 2006 schedule were selective.", "The General Court therefore annulled the decision at issue in so far as it initiates the formal investigation procedure in relation to that schedule .", "Forms of order sought and procedure before the Court of Justice", "10", "The Commission claims

support of the form of order sought by the City of Lübeck.", "The appeal", "First ground of appeal: the decision at issue was not of individual concern to FL", "Arguments of the parties", "13", "By its first ground of appeal, the Commission criticises the General Court for having held that the decision at issue was of individual concern to FL when, in its submission, it is the supervisory authority of the Land and not the operator of the airport which sets the airport charges.", "In holding, in paragraphs 29 to 35 of the judgment under appeal, that, by the adoption of the 2006 schedule, FL had exercised powers which were conferred upon it alone, the General Court ignored the rule of national law applicable in the present instance that a schedule relating to airport charges must be approved by the supervisory authority of the Land, which is itself bound by the federal legislation on airport charges.", "The mere fact that the public undertaking which operates the airport is responsible for proposing the schedule does not mean that it is it, and not the State, which has the power to determine its management and the policies which it applies by means of that schedule.", "In this regard, the General Court’s assessment conflicts with that resulting from the judgment of 10 July 1986, DEFI v Commission (282/85, EU:C:1986:316), in which it was found, in particular, that, under the relevant French legislation, the French Government had the power to determine the management and policies of the organisation concerned and hence to define the interests which that organisation was to protect.", "14", "The City of Lübeck and the Federal Republic of Germany contend that this ground of appeal should be dismissed.", "Findings of the Court", "15", "As the General Court recalled in paragraph 26 of the judgment under appeal, persons other than those to whom a decision is addressed may claim to be individually concerned within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU only if that decision affects them by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons and by virtue of these factors distinguishes them individually just as in the case of the person addressed(judgments of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission, 25/62, EU:C:1963:17, 107; of 3 October 2013, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, C‑583/11 P, EU:C:2013:625, paragraph 72; and of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraph 46).", "16", "In the present instance, in holding the decision at issue to be of individual concern to FL, the General Court found, in paragraph 34 of the judgment under appeal, that inasmuch as that decision relates to the 2006 schedule, it affects a measure of which FL is one of the authors and prevents FL from exercising its own powers as it sees fit.", "In so determining, the General Court pointed out in particular, in paragraph 29 of that judgment, that, whilst it was true that Paragraph 43a(1) of the LuftVZO provided that the supervisory authority of the Land, in this instance the aviation authority of the Land of Schleswig-Holstein, had to approve the schedule concerning the charges applicable to an airport, it was, however, clear from that provision that the schedule had to be proposed by the operator of the airport in question and that the supervisory authority had no power of its own to set the charges itself, as it could only authorise or reject the proposed schedule.", "17", "The General Court also noted, in paragraphs 30 and 31 of the judgment under appeal, that it was clear from the decision at issue and the 2006 schedule that the possibility of applying reduced charges, within the framework of discounts provided for by that schedule, was dependent on an agreement concluded directly between the operator of Lübeck Airport and an airline, without intervention on the part of the supervisory authority, and that it was indeed by means of agreements concluded directly between FL and Ryanair that special charges, derogating from those laid down by the 2006 schedule, had been applied to that airline.", "18", "The General Court inferred therefrom, in paragraph 32 of the judgment under appeal, that FL was vested, in its capacity as the operator of Lübeck Airport, with a power of its own in respect of the setting of the airport charges applicable to that airport and was not acting solely as an extension of the State by exercising powers conferred solely upon the latter.", "Thus, according to the General Court, the power to adopt the 2006 schedule lay with FL and not the State authorities, notwithstanding the requirement that the supervisory authority approve that schedule.", "19", "It is apparent that the General Court thus, in the light of the applicable national law, took the view that FL had — beyond the power to propose to the supervisory authority the schedule setting the airport charges applicable to Lübeck Airport — a power of its own to adopt that schedule.", "20", "As the Commission challenges that view by its line of argument set out in paragraph 13 of the present judgment, it should be pointed out that, in the case of an interpretation of national law by the General Court, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction, on appeal, only to determine whether that law was distorted, and the distortion must be obvious from the documents on its file (see, to that effect, judgments of 5 July 2011, Edwin v OHIM, C‑263/09 P, EU:C:2011:452, paragraph 53, and of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraphs 79 and 80 and the case-law cited).", "21", "In the present instance, the Commission has not pleaded and, a fortiori, has not demonstrated such distortion of national law.", "Indeed, it has neither contended nor established that the General Court developed reasoning running manifestly counter to the content of the provisions of German law at issue or ascribed to one of those provisions a scope that it manifestly does not have in the light of other material in the file (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 81).", "22", "Therefore, the first ground of appeal must be dismissed as inadmissible.", "Second ground of appeal: the City of Lübeck did not have a current legal interest in bringing proceedings", "Arguments of the parties", "23", "By its second ground of appeal, the Commission contends that the General Court erred in law, in paragraph 37 of the judgment under appeal, by holding, first, that FL had a legal interest in bringing proceedings even after the sale of Lübeck Airport to a private investor since the formal investigation procedure had not been closed and the decision at issue therefore continued to produce effects and, secondly, that FL had in any event retained an interest in bringing proceedings in respect of the period before the sale.", "24", "It submits that, even in the absence of a final decision closing the formal investigation procedure, the decision at issue had ceased to produce its sole legal effect, namely the obligation to suspend the aid measure during the investigation, since no suspension was ordered up until 31 December 2012, and from 1 January 2013, the date on which Lübeck Airport was privatised, the 2006 schedule could no longer be regarded as an aid scheme in the course of implementation because the airport was no longer financed by public funds.", "The assessment of the General Court is contrary to the Court of Justice’s case-law according to which the interest must be vested and present and continues to exist only if the action is liable, if successful, to procure an advantage for the party bringing it.", "The City of Lübeck has indeed not shown that it had any interest in maintaining its action after the privatisation of the airport.", "25", "The City of Lübeck and the Federal Republic of Germany contend that this ground of appeal should be dismissed.", "Findings of the Court", "26", "In accordance with the Court’s settled case-law, an applicant’s interest in bringing proceedings must, in the light of the purpose of the action, exist when the action is lodged, failing which the action will be inadmissible.", "That purpose must, like the interest in bringing proceedings, continue to exist until the final decision, failing which there will be no need to adjudicate; this presupposes that the action must be liable, if successful, to procure an advantage for the party bringing it (judgment of 28 May 2013, Abdulrahim v Council and Commission, C‑239/12 P, EU:C:2013:331, paragraph 61 and the case-law cited).", "27", "In the present instance, in order to reject the Commission’s argument that the sale of Lübeck Airport to a private company on 1 January 2013 put an end to the aid scheme in question, so that the obligation to suspend that scheme no longer adversely affected the City of Lübeck and the latter therefore had no current interest in seeking the annulment of the decision at issue, the General Court held, as stated in paragraph 23 of the present judgment, that, since the formal investigation procedure was not closed, that decision still produced effects and that the City of Lübeck at the very least retained an interest in bringing proceedings in respect of the period before the airport was sold.", "28", "Previously, in paragraph 27 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted, referring inter alia to the judgment of 24 October 2013, Deutsche Post v Commission (C‑77/12 P, not published, EU:C:2013:695, paragraphs 52 and 53), that a decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure in relation to a measure in the course of implementation and classified as ‘new aid’ entails independent legal effects, particularly as regards the suspension of that measure.", "It stated that such a decision necessarily alters the legal scope of the measure under consideration and the legal position of the recipient undertakings, particularly as regards the continued application of the measure.", "It also observed that after the adoption of such a decision there is at the very least a significant element of doubt as to the legality of the measure in the course of implementation which must lead the Member State to suspend its application and that such a decision may also be invoked before a national court called upon to draw all the appropriate conclusions arising from an infringement of the last sentence of Article 108(3) TFEU.", "29", "In that regard, it should be recalled that the Court of Justice has also held, in the judgment of 21 November 2013, Deutsche Lufthansa (C‑284/12, EU:C:2013:755, paragraph 45) and in the order of the Court of 4 April 2014, Flughafen Lübeck (C‑27/13, not published, EU:C:2014:240, paragraph 27), that where, in accordance with Article 108(3) TFEU, the Commission has initiated a formal investigation procedure with regard to a measure which has not been notified and is in the course of implementation, a national court hearing an application for the cessation of the implementation of that measure and for the recovery of the sums already paid is required to adopt all the measures that are necessary in order to draw the appropriate conclusions from any infringement of the obligation to suspend the implementation of that measure.", "To that end, the national court may decide to suspend the implementation of the measure in question and order the recovery of the sums already paid.", "It may also decide to order interim measures in order to safeguard, first, the interests of the parties concerned and, secondly, the effectiveness of the Commission’s decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure.", "30", "Thus, it is clear from the case-law of the Court of Justice that, contrary to the Commission’s submissions, the obligation to suspend the implementation of the measure in question is not the only legal effect of a decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure.", "31", "In the present instance, in the light of that case-law it is apparent that, as the General Court stated, after the privatisation of Lübeck Airport the City of Lübeck remained at least exposed to the risk that a national court might order the recovery of any aid granted when FL owned the airport.", "The General Court was therefore correct in holding that, in the absence of a final decision of the Commission closing the formal investigation procedure, the effects of the decision at issue endured, so that the City of Lübeck retained an interest in bringing proceedings seeking the annulment of that decision.", "32", "Consequently, the second ground of appeal must be dismissed as unfounded.", "Third ground of appeal: incorrect assessment of the selectivity of the 2006 schedule", "Arguments of the parties", "33", "By its third ground of appeal, the Commission submits that the General Court misinterpreted the condition relating to selectivity for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU, in holding, in paragraphs 53 to 55 of the judgment under appeal, that, in order to assess whether a fee scale drawn up by a public entity for the use of goods or services may be selective, it is necessary to determine whether it applies in a non-discriminatory manner to all of the undertakings using or able to use those goods or services and the circumstance in the present instance that the 2006 schedule applies only to airlines using Lübeck Airport is not relevant.", "34", "That interpretation conflicts with the Court of Justice’s case-law according to which a measure is not a general measure of tax or economic policy, and is thus selective, if it applies only to certain sectors of the economy or to certain undertakings in a given sector.", "As a measure laying down the conditions on which a public undertaking offers its own goods or services never applies to all economic operators, it always constitutes a selective measure.", "35", "It does not matter that that measure applies in a non-discriminatory manner to all of the undertakings using or able to use those goods or services, as the question of unequal treatment or discrimination is not relevant for deciding whether there is aid.", "The General Court wrongly relied in this regard on the criterion adopted in the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer andamp; Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), which applies only to tax measures, and failed to take account of the effect of the judgments of 2 February 1988, Kwekerij van der Kooy and Others v Commission (67/85, 68/85 and 70/85, EU:C:1988:38), of 29 February 1996, Belgium v Commission (C‑56/93, EU:C:1996:64), of 20 November 2003, GEMO (C‑126/01, EU:C:2003:622), and of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732).", "36", "In the alternative, the Commission submits that the General Court also failed to take account, in paragraphs 52 and 53 of the judgment under appeal, of the Court of Justice’s case-law according to which, first, the selectivity of a measure is assessed essentially in the light of the measure’s effects and, secondly, measures which benefit only one economic sector are selective.", "It states that, whilst Lübeck Airport is in direct competition with Hamburg Airport (Germany), the advantage conferred by the 2006 schedule benefits only airlines that use the former, a fact which, in its submission, is sufficient to demonstrate that the schedule is selective.", "The approach adopted by the General Court has the effect of exempting schedules setting airport charges from the State aid rules.", "37", "In the further alternative, the Commission contends that, assuming that the criterion laid down in the judgment of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer andamp; Peggauer Zementwerke (C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598), is applicable for the purpose of establishing the selectivity of rules setting the charges of certain public institutions, the General Court misinterpreted that criterion.", "In order to determine the set of undertakings which are in a comparable situation, regard should be had not to the scope of the measure in question but to the undertakings which have items of expenditure similar to those of the undertakings favoured by that measure.", "Furthermore, the 2006 schedule is selective because it does not observe the principle — laid down in Paragraph 43a(1) of the LuftVZO — which applies to all German airports and therefore to all the airlines serving those airports that airport charges must cover costs.", "By adopting the scope of the 2006 schedule, and not the objective pursued by that provision, as the decisive factor, the General Court erred in law.", "38", "The Commission contends, finally, that the General Court also erred in law by failing to examine whether the discounts provided for by the 2006 schedule were selective on the ground that only airlines which satisfied certain conditions benefitted from them.", "39", "The City of Lübeck, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Kingdom of Spain contend that this ground of appeal should be dismissed.", "Findings of the Court", "40", "As the General Court recalled in paragraph 43 of the judgment under appeal, in accordance with settled case-law classification as ‘State aid’ requires all the following conditions to be fulfilled.", "First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources.", "Second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States.", "Third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient.", "Fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, inter alia, judgment of 16 July 2015, BVVG, C‑39/14, EU:C:2015:470, paragraph 24).", "41", "So far as concerns the condition relating to the selectivity of the advantage, which is a constituent factor in the concept of ‘State aid’ within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, since this provision prohibits aid ‘favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’, it is clear from the Court’s settled case-law, recalled in paragraphs 45 and 46 of the judgment under appeal, that the assessment of that condition requires it to be determined whether, under a particular legal regime, a national measure is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over others which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation.", "The concept of ‘State aid’ does not refer to State measures which differentiate between undertakings and which are, therefore, prima facie selective where that differentiation arises from the nature or the overall structure of the system of which they form part (see judgments of 8 November 2001, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer andamp; Peggauer Zementwerke, C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598, paragraphs 41 and 42; of 22 December 2008, British Aggregates v Commission, C‑487/06 P, EU:C:2008:757, paragraphs 82 and 83; of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 74 and 75; and of 14 January 2015, Eventech, C‑518/13, EU:C:2015:9, paragraphs 54 and 55).", "42", "In upholding the plea put forward by the City of Lübeck alleging infringement of Article 107(1) TFEU in that the Commission found in the decision at issue that the 2006 schedule was selective, the General Court stated, first of all, in paragraph 50 of the judgment under appeal, that that finding was based, in the decision at issue, exclusively on the ground that the advantages in question were granted only to airlines using Lübeck Airport.", "43", ">Next, in paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that the fact that the 2006 schedule applied only to those airlines was inherent in the German legal regime on airport charges and in the very nature of rules setting such charges, and that, within the framework of that legal regime, the airlines using other German airports were subject there to schedules of charges which applied specifically to those airports and they were not therefore in a situation comparable to that of the airlines using Lübeck Airport.", "44", "Furthermore, in paragraph 52 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held that, although it was clear from the case-law that aid may be selective even where it concerns a whole economic sector, that case-law, developed in particular in the context of national measures of general application, was not directly relevant to the case in point as the measure in question did not concern the whole airport sector, but only the airlines using Lübeck Airport.", "45", "Finally, in paragraph 53 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court stated, in essence, that the selectivity of a measure by which a public entity lays down a fee scale for the use of its goods or services is assessed by referring to all of the undertakings using or able to use those goods and services and by examining whether all or only some of them obtain or are able to obtain any possible advantage.", "46", "In the light of those considerations, the General Court held, in paragraphs 54 and 55 of the judgment under appeal, that the mere fact that the 2006 schedule applied only to airlines using Lübeck Airport was not relevant for the purpose of finding that that schedule was selective and that, since it was not disputed that all the airlines could benefit from the pricing provisions of that schedule, ‘the Commission was wrong, in the light of the statement of reasons contained in the [decision at issue], to have found that the 2006 schedule was selective’.", "47", "It is to be noted that, contrary to the Commission’s submissions, it certainly does not follow from the case-law of the Court of Justice that a measure by which a public undertaking lays down the conditions for the use of its goods or services is always, and therefore by its very nature, a selective measure for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "The judgments to which it refers, in particular those mentioned in paragraph 35 of the present judgment, do not set out a general rule of that kind.", "48", "It is, on the contrary, settled case-law that Article 107(1) TFEU does not distinguish between measures of State intervention by reference to their causes or their aims but defines them in relation to their effects, and thus independently of the techniques used (judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 87 and the case-law cited).", "49", "Accordingly, whilst it cannot be ruled out that a measure by which a public undertaking lays down the conditions for the use of its goods or services is selective despite applying to all the undertakings using those goods or services, it is necessary, in order to determine whether that is the case, to have regard not to the nature of that measure but to its effects, by examining whether the advantage which it is supposed to procure in fact benefits only some of those undertakings as opposed to others, although, in the light of the objective pursued by the regime concerned, all of the undertakings are in a comparable factual and legal situation .", "50", "It follows that the Commission’s principal line of argument, set out in paragraph 34 of the present judgment, that a measure laying down the conditions on which a public undertaking offers its own goods or services always constitutes a selective measure, is unfounded.", "51", "That assessment is not called into question by the Commission’s contention, referred to in paragraph 35 of the present judgment, that it does not matter, for the purpose of deciding whether there is aid, that such a measure applies in a non-discriminatory manner to all of the undertakings using or able to use those goods or services or by the argument that the General Court wrongly relied on the case-law relating to tax measures.", "52", "First, in order to determine whether a measure, although applying generally to a set of economic operators, has the effect of ultimately conferring an advantage only on certain undertakings, it should be examined, as is apparent from the case-law recalled in paragraph 41 of the present judgment, whether certain undertakings are favoured over others which, in the light of the objective pursued by the legal regime concerned, are in a comparable factual and legal situation .", "53", "The examination of whether such a measure is selective is thus, in essence, coextensive with the examination of whether it applies to that set of economic operators in a non-discriminatory manner (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 January 2015, Eventech, C‑518/13, EU:C:2015:9, paragraph 53).", "The concept of selectivity, as the Advocate General states in point 75 of his Opinion, is thus linked to that of discrimination.", "54", "Secondly, as is also apparent from that case-law, that examination of selectivity must be carried out within the context of ‘a particular legal regime’.", "In order to determine whether a measure is selective, it should therefore be examined whether, within the context of a specified legal regime, that measure constitutes an advantage for certain undertakings over others which are, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, in a comparable factual and legal situation (judgments of 6 September 2006, Portugal v Commission, C‑88/03, EU:C:2006:511, paragraph 56, and of 28 July 2011, Mediaset v Commission, C‑403/10 P, not published, EU:C:2011:533, paragraph 36).", "55", "That examination therefore in principle requires prior definition of the reference framework within which the measure concerned fits.", "As the Advocate General argues in points 77 and 86 to 89 of his Opinion, this method is not limited solely to the examination of tax measures, the Court having merely observed that the determination of the reference framework is of particular importance in the case of tax measures since the very existence of an advantage may be established only when compared with ‘normal’ taxation (judgment of 6 September 2006, Portugal v Commission, C‑88/03, EU:C:2006:511, paragraph 56).", "56", "As for the arguments advanced by the Commission in the alternative, set out in paragraphs 36 to 38 of the present judgment, it should be pointed out in the first place, with regard to the complaint that the effects of the measure concerned were not taken into account, that the General Court examined the legality of the decision at issue in the light of its grounds, according to which the advantages in question were granted only to airlines using Lübeck Airport, and found that those grounds constituted the only reasoning in that decision concerning selectivity .", "57", "Furthermore, in implicitly holding, in paragraph 53 of the judgment under appeal, that the 2006 schedule is not discriminatory and in finding, in paragraph 55 of that judgment, that it was not disputed that all the airlines using or liable to use Lübeck Airport may benefit from the pricing provisions of that schedule, the General Court took account of the schedule’s effects.", "58", "In the second place, contrary to the Commission’s contentions, a measure which benefits only one economic sector or some of the undertakings in that sector is not necessarily selective.", "It is selective, as follows from the reasoning set out in paragraphs 41 and 47 to 55 of the present judgment, only if, within the context of a particular legal regime, it has the effect of conferring an advantage on certain undertakings over others, in a different sector or the same sector, which are, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, in a comparable factual and legal situation.", "59", "Likewise,the fact that, in the present instance, Lübeck Airport is in direct competition with Hamburg Airport or other German airports and that only airlines using Lübeck Airport benefit from any advantages conferred by the 2006 schedule is not sufficient to establish that that schedule is selective.", "In order for the 2006 schedule to be selective, it would have to be established that, within the context of a legal regime under which all those airports fall, that schedule confers an advantage on airlines using Lübeck Airport to the detriment of airlines using the other airports which are, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, in a comparable factual and legal situation.", "60", "In the third place, as follows from the reasoning set out in paragraphs 52 to 55 of the present judgment, determination of the set of undertakings which are in a comparable factual and legal situation depends on the prior definition of the legal regime in the light of whose objective it must, as the case may be, be examined whether the factual and legal situation of the undertakings favoured by the measure in question is comparable with that of those which are not.", "61", "In this regard, in paragraphs 32 and 51 of the judgment under appeal the General Court, in the exercise of its power to interpret national law, found — as is clear from paragraphs 16 to 21 of the present judgment — that, in accordance with Paragraph 43a(1) of the LuftVZO, the operator of an airport, exercising a power of its own, draws up the scale of airport fees applicable to that airport.", "62", "It is clear from that finding that, in the present instance, it is not Paragraph 43a(1) of the LuftVZO or other legislation applicable to all airports — from which the 2006 schedule might have derogated in favour of airlines using Lübeck Airport — that lays down the airport charges applicable to an airport, but the schedule adopted for this purpose by the airport operator itself in the exercise of a power limited to that airport.", "Accordingly, it is apparent that, as the Advocate General states in point 112 of his Opinion, the relevant reference framework for examining whether the 2006 schedule had the effect of favouring certain airlines over others which were in a comparable factual and legal situation was that of the regime applicable to Lübeck Airport alone.", "63", "Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law when, after delimiting in this way the legal regime that was relevant in the present instance, it held that the airlines serving other German airports were not in a situation comparable to that of the airlines using Lübeck Airport.", "64", "Therefore, after pointing out that the 2006 schedule applied in a non-discriminatory manner to all airlines using or liable to use Lübeck Airport, the General Court was correct in holding, in the light of the statement of reasons for the decision at issue, that the Commission had wrongly found that the schedule was selective .", "65", "Finally, the General Court cannot be criticised for having failed to examine whether the discounts provided for by the 2006 schedule were selective in that they are said to favour certain airlines using Lübeck Airport to the detriment of other airlines using it.", "Whilst, as the Commission submits, the decision at issue contains a description of those discounts and a preliminary legal assessment, the fact remains that that assessment concerns only the existence of an advantage for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU and that the statement of reasons in the decision at issue concerning selectivity rests solely on the finding that the advantages in question benefitted only the airlines using Lübeck Airport.", "Therefore, when examining the plea put forward by the City of Lübeck alleging that the Commission had infringed Article 107(1) TFEU in its assessment of the condition relating to selectivity, the General Court was correct in ruling on the legality of the decision at issue in the light solely of the grounds which formed the basis for that assessment.", "66", "It follows that the arguments advanced by the Commission in the alternative are unfounded.", "67", "Consequently, the third ground of appeal must be dismissed as unfounded.", "Fourth ground of appeal: defects in the reasoning of the judgment under appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "68", "By its fourth ground of appeal, the Commission contends, first, that the judgment under appeal fails to state grounds in three respects.", "First of all, it does not contain any finding relating to the objective pursued by the measure in question, although it is in the light of that objective that the undertakings in a comparable factual and legal situation are to be determined.", "Next, it does not contain any reasoning concerning the discounts provided for by the 2006 schedule.", "Finally, it does not set out why that schedule is so manifestly not selective that the Commission was not entitled to initiate a formal investigation procedure.", "69", "The Commission submits, secondly, that the General Court’s reasoning is contradictory because it applies the case-law relating to the selectivity of tax measures in paragraphs 51 and 53 of the judgment under appeal and then states in paragraph 57 that that case-law is not relevant.", "70", "The City of Lübeck, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Kingdom of Spain contend that this ground of appeal should be dismissed.", "Findings of the Court", "71", "It is apparent, first, that, in the light of the statement of reasons contained in the decision at issue and the Commission’s line of argument set out before the General Court, according to both of which the 2006 schedule was selective on the ground that it applied only to airlines using Lübeck Airport, the General Court amply stated, in the judgment under appeal, the reasons for which it held that such a finding was not possible on the basis of that fact alone.", "As regards, in particular, determination of the undertakings in a comparable factual and legal situation, it specified in paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal the reasons for which airlines using other airports were not, within the framework of the legal regime in question, in a situation comparable to that of the airlines using Lübeck Airport.", "72", "Secondly, for the reasons set out in paragraph 65 of the present judgment, the General Court was not required to adjudicate on the discounts provided for by the 2006 schedule.", "73", "Thirdly, the General Court had the task not of assessing whether that schedule was manifestly selective or manifestly not selective, but, as will be examined in connection with the fifth ground of appeal, whether the decision at issue was vitiated by a manifest error of assessment.", "74", "Finally, the Commission’s argument relating to contradictory grounds is based on an assertion which is not supported in the slightest.", "75", "The fourth ground of appeal must therefore be dismissed as unfounded.", "Fifth ground of appeal: disregard of the limits on judicial review of a decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure in relation to State aid", "Arguments of the parties", "76", "By its fifth ground of appeal, the Commission submits that the General Court failed to have regard to the fact that a decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure is subject to a limited judicial review, in particular so far as concerns the statement of reasons for it.", "The Commission explains that a mere preliminary examination of the facts did not enable it to dispel its doubts as to whether the 2006 schedule was selective.", "The judgment under appeal contains no explanation as to why the schedule was so manifestly not selective that the Commission was not entitled to initiate the formal investigation procedure.", "77", "The City of Lübeck, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Kingdom of Spain contend that this ground of appeal should be dismissed.", "Findings of the Court", "78", "As the General Court pointed out in paragraph 42 of the judgment under appeal, review by the EU judicature of the legality of a decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure, where the applicant challenges the Commission’s assessment of a measure as constituting State aid, is limited to ascertaining whether or not the Commission has made a manifest error of assessment (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 July 2011, Alcoa Trasformazioni v Commission, C‑194/09 P, EU:C:2011:497, paragraph 61).", "79", "It follows from what has been held in paragraphs 47 to 55 of the present judgment that the Commission’s assessment that the advantages arising from the 2006 schedule were selective for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU merely because they were granted solely to airlines using Lübeck Airport, an assessment on the basis of which it decided to initiate the formal investigation procedure in respect of that schedule, is manifestly incorrect.", "80", "The General Court was therefore correct in holding, in paragraph 59 of the judgment under appeal, that, in view of that reasoning, the decision at issue was vitiated by a manifest error of assessment and in annulling that decision in so far as it concerns the 2006 schedule.", "81", "The fifth ground of appeal must consequently be dismissed as unfounded.", "82", "Since none of the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant has been upheld, the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.", "Costs", "83", "Under Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs.", "Under Article 138(1) of the Rules of Procedure, which is applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "Since the Commission has been unsuccessful and the City of Lübeck has applied for costs, the Commission must be ordered to pay the costs of the present appeal.", "84", "Pursuant to Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure, which is applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Kingdom of Spain are to bear their own costs.", "On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby:", "1.",

General Court of the European Union of 20 September 2019, FVE Holýšov I and Others v Commission (T‑217/17, not published, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2019:633), by which the General Court dismissed their action seeking partial annulment of Commission Decision C(2016) 7827 final of 28 November 2016 on State aid SA.40171 (2015/NN) concerning the promotion of electricity production from renewable energy sources (‘the decision at issue’).", "1        By its cross-appeal, the European Commission asks the Court of Justice to annul the decision contained in paragraph 174 of the judgment under appeal, not to rule on the admissibility of the action and to declare the action inadmissible.", "Background to the dispute and the decision at issue", "2        The background to the dispute and the content of the decision at issue were set out as follows in paragraphs 1 to 19 of the judgment under appeal:", "‘1      By a letter dated 16 December 2003, two Czech associations active in the renewable energy sector, the Czech Society for Wind Energy and Eurosolar, sent a complaint to the Commission of the European Communities, concerning, inter alia, a draft law of the Czech Republic seeking to promote electricity generated from renewable energy sources (“RES”), the nature of that draft law being – they claimed – contrary to the EU State aid rules, and asking the Commission to contact the Czech authorities in order that they would notify the proposed aid scheme.", "The Commission informed the [complainants], by a letter dated 27 July 2004 (“the 2004 letter”), that, on the basis of the evidence in its possession, it considered that the proposed promotion system did not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, as it did not involve State resources.", "2      The draft law referred to in paragraph 1 above was adopted as the Zákon o podpoře výroby elektřiny z obnovitelných zdrojů energie a o změně některých zákonů (zákon o podpoře využívání obnovitelných zdrojů) (Law on the support of the production of electricity from [renewable energy sources] and amending various laws), of 31 March 2005 (180/2005 Sb.) (“the initial scheme”).", "3      The initial scheme established a number of measures for operators using electricity-generating facilities from RES (“the producers concerned”), including photovoltaic installations.", "4      The measures established by the initial scheme, guaranteed during the life of the installations (20 years for photovoltaic installations), could take two forms:", "–        – either, for the producers concerned who chose to sell all the electricity which they produced to an operator of the electricity network, that of a minimum purchase price, set annually by the Energetický regulační úřad (Czech Energy Regulatory Office, “ERO”), established on the basis of, inter alia, the investment and operating costs of photovoltaic installations, which were to be recovered during the first 15 years of operation, the five remaining years constituting accordingly those producers’ profit (“the purchase price”).", "Any potential reduction of the purchase price compared to that fixed in the previous year was subject to a 5% cap (“the 5% cap”); in other words, the purchase price for a given RES-based technology implemented in a given year could not be less than 95% of the previous year’s purchase price for the same technology;", "–        – or that of a “green bonus” which represents a supplement to the market price for the producers concerned who chose to sell their electricity on the market.", "5      The measures introduced by the initial scheme were financed exclusively by a special levy (“the RES levy”), in the form of a surcharge on electricity transmission and electricity distribution tariffs, paid by electricity end customers to the electricity transmission system operator […] and the regional electricity distribution companies […], with the result that end customers fully bore the burden of financing of those measures.", "That levy was imposed by the decree adopted by ERO and its amount determined by the latter by means of price decisions.", "6      In 2010, the Czech Republic amended the initial scheme, on three occasions, on 21 April, 30 November and 14 December.", "The Czech Republic highlighted the fact that the initial scheme thus amended (“the amended scheme”) was intended to avoid the risk of overcompensation, connected with the combined effect of the 5% cap and the decline in costs of photovoltaic installations, which has been higher than 5% for some years.", "7      Consequently, with effect from 1 January 2011, the Czech Republic imposed on the producers concerned, inter alia, a levy known as “solar levy”, on the purchase prices and the green bonuses, granted to photovoltaic installations commissioned between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010 (except for certain small plants, with an operational capacity of less than 30 kilowatts).", "8      The solar levy was equal to 26% of the purchase price for the period covering the years 2011 to 2013 and 10% of the purchase price from 1 January 2014.", "At the same time, the green bonus referred to in paragraph 4 above was taxed at 28% for the period covering the years 2011 to 2013 and 11% from 1 January 2014.", "9      Other measures were also adopted under the amended scheme.", "Accordingly, the 5% cap was abolished for certain installations brought into service after 1 January 2011 and, on 31 December 2010, it put an end to the exemption from income tax, which had originally to be applicable for a period of 6 years.", "10      The amended scheme therefore had the effect of reducing the benefits of the measures granted to the producers concerned using photovoltaic installations by way of the promotion of electricity production from RES.", "11      From 1 January 2011, the amended scheme was financed partly by means of the RES levy and partly by the State budget.", "12      On 11 December 2014, the Czech Republic, pursuant to Article 108(3) TFEU, notified the Commission of the support scheme for electricity production from RES, produced by installations commissioned between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2012.", "13      On 28 November 2016, the Commission adopted [the decision at issue], a summary of which was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJ 2017 C 69, p. 2) […]", "14      First of all, in paragraphs 68 to 84 of the [decision at issue], the Commission found that the four cumulative conditions relating to the existence of State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, were satisfied in the present case and that, consequently, the measures at issue constituted State aid.", "15      Next, in paragraphs 87 to 90 of the [decision at issue], the Commission took the view that the measures at issue constituted new aid, as the 2004 letter could not be regarded as a decision not to raise objections under Article 4(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [108 TFEU] (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1).", "16      In paragraph 93 of the [decision at issue], the Commission found the measures at issue, having regard to their environmental objective, to be an aid scheme compatible with the internal market under Article 107(3)(c) TFEU and in the light of the Community Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection (OJ 2001 C 37, p. 3) and the Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection (OJ 2008 C 82, p. 1) (“the 2008 Guidelines”).", "17      Moreover, the Commission took note of the fact that the Czech authorities had given an undertaking to put in place a review mechanism intended to prevent the risk of overcompensation that could result from the cumulation of investment aid measures with other types of operating aid, or an overestimation of any cost element taken into account in connection with the purchase price or the green bonus (“the review mechanism”).", "It is clear from that undertaking that that mechanism should have entered into force in February 2019 for the installations commissioned during the period 2006 to 2008.", "18      In addition, in paragraph 5 of the [decision at issue], the Commission replied to the observations of the interested parties, taking the view, in particular, as regards the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations, that the actual or potential beneficiaries of the initial scheme could not have based their legitimate expectations on unlawful State aid and that the 2004 letter contained only a provisional assessment concerning a draft law (paragraphs 136 and 137 of the [decision at issue]).", "As regards the alleged infringement of the bilateral investment treaties and of the Energy Charter Treaty, signed in Lisbon on 17 December 1994 (OJ 1994 L 380, p. 24) […], the Commission stated that any bilateral investment treaty […] containing a provision enabling recourse to an arbitrator to decide on a dispute within the European Union between an investor and a Member State was contrary to several provisions of the [TEU] and the [TFEU] (paragraphs 143 and 144 of that decision) and that it followed from the wording, the purpose and the context of the [Energy Charter Treaty] that it did not apply to situations internal to the Union (paragraph 147 of that decision).", "19      Lastly, in the operative part of the [decision at issue], the Commission stated that it was regrettable that the Czech Republic had already implemented the aid measure at issue, in infringement of Article 108(3) TFEU, declared the aid scheme notified as being compatible with the internal market on the basis of Article 107(3)(c) TFEU and therefore decided not to raise any objections to that aid scheme.’", "The judgment under appeal", "3        By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 3 April 2017, the appellants brought an action for partial annulment of the decision at issue.", "4        By the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the seven pleas in law raised by the appellants and dismissed their action, without ruling on its admissibility.", "Forms of order sought by the parties before the Court of Justice", "Form of order sought in the main appeal", "5        By their appeal, the appellants claim that the Court should:", "–        set aside the judgment under appeal;", "–        uphold their action brought against the decision at issue;", "–        in the alternative, refer the case back to the General Court;", "–        order the Commission to pay the costs.", "6        The Commission contends that the Court should:", "–        set aside the judgment under appeal and declare the action brought at first instance to be inadmissible;", "–        dismiss the appeal;", "–        order the appellants to pay the costs.", "7        The Kingdom of Spain seeks the same form of order as the Commission.", "8        The Czech Republic contends that the appeal should be dismissed and that the appellants should be ordered to pay the costs.", "9        By order of the President of the Court of Justice of 9 June 2020, the Republic of Poland was granted leave to intervene in support of the form of order sought by the Commission.", "10      By decision of the President of the Court of Justice of 16 December 2020, the Federal Republic of Germany was granted leave, in accordance with Article 129(4) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, to intervene in the oral part of the proceedings in support of the form of order sought by the appellants.", "Form of order sought in the cross-appeal", "11      By its cross-appeal, the Commission claims that the Court should:", "–        in the event that it upholds the main appeal,", "–        set aside the General Court’s decision in paragraph 174 of the judgment under appeal not to rule on the admissibility of the action,", "–        declare the action to be inadmissible,", "–        and order the appellants to pay the costs incurred before the General Court and the Court of Justice;", "–        in the event that it declares the action before the General Court to be inadmissible of its own motion or decides not to uphold the main appeal,", "–        declare that the cross-appeal is devoid of purpose,", "–        and order the appellants to pay the costs incurred before the General Court and the Court of Justice.", "12      The appellants contend that the Court should:", "–        dismiss the cross-appeal as inadmissible;", "–        in the event that the Court rules on the admissibility of the action,", "–        declare the action admissible, or", "–        in the alternative, should the Court consider the action to be inadmissible, dismiss the action and annul the decision at issue in its entirety;", "–        in the event that the Court finds that the appellants have not demonstrated the existence of a decision by the Commission, taken in 2006 (‘the 2006 decision’), that the promotion system adopted by the Czech Republic in 2005 did not, as regards its relevant characteristics, depart from the system as presented to the Commission during the years 2003-2004, or the absence of a ‘levy’ in the initial promotion scheme for the purposes of the considerations relating to the law on State aid, adopt the procedural measures sought by the appellants or refer the case back to the General Court;", "–        order the Commission to pay the costs incurred before the General Court and the Court of Justice.", "13      The Czech Republic, the Kingdom of Spain and the Slovak Republic support the cross-appeal.", "The main appeal", "14      In support of the forms of order sought, the appellants raise eight grounds of appeal.", "The first ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "15      By their first ground of appeal, the appellants submit that the General Court was wrong to refuse to accept that the 2004 letter was in the nature of a decision.", "16      First, in their submission, the General Court reached the conclusion that that letter did not constitute a binding decision on the basis of an incorrect reformulation of the case-law of the Court of Justice, in paragraphs 49 to 61 of the judgment under appeal, and by misinterpreting the file.", "17      The General Court wrongly held that the criteria for such a decision were set out in paragraph 55 of the judgment of 13 February 2014, Hungary v Commission (C‑31/13 P, EU:C:2014:70), when they are set out in paragraph 54 of that judgment and are twofold, namely the substance of the measure and the intention of its authors.", "The fact that the 2004 letter is in the nature of a decision is apparent from its substance, and from the Commission’s intentions.", "18      In addition, the General Court also erred in stating, in paragraphs 58 and 59 of the judgment under appeal, that even if the 2004 letter were in the nature of a decision, it did not in any way prevent the adoption of the decision at issue, on the ground that that decision provided for a promotion scheme substantially different from that of the draft law brought to the attention of the Commission in 2003, as regards the method of financing.", "According to the appellants, that assertion is contradicted by the factual evidence in the file.", "19      Secondly, by stating in paragraph 59 of the judgment under appeal that the Commission had claimed, ‘without having been challenged by the [appellants]’, that, unlike the initial scheme, that draft law did not indicate that the RES levy was imposed on end customers by an act of the public authorities, the General Court, according to the appellants, vitiated its judgment by a procedural irregularity.", "That incorrect assertion demonstrates that the General Court did not examine the evidence adduced, nor did it take into account the appellants’ proposal to submit additional evidence.", "20      The Commission contends that the first ground of appeal should be rejected.", "Findings of the Court of Justice", "21", "It should be noted that the decision-making nature of the 2004 letter, even if that were established, has no bearing on the lawfulness of the decision at issue.", "22", "In that regard, the General Court held, in paragraph 59 of the judgment under appeal, having regard to the information available to it, that the scheme for the promotion of electricity production from RES, which was notified in 2014 and which gave rise to the decision at issue, was substantially different from the provisional scheme as set out in the 2003 draft law which was the subject of the 2004 letter.", "23", "That assessment by the General Court of the facts and evidence before it cannot be challenged before the appeal court, except where the facts have been distorted (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 May 2019, CJ v ECDC, C‑170/18 P, not published, EU:C:2019:410, paragraph 23 and the case-law cited), which is not relied on by the appellants, which claim only that the General Court did not examine the evidence adduced, nor did it take account of their offer to submit additional evidence.", "24", "Consequently, the first ground of appeal must be rejected.", "The second ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "25      By their second ground of appeal, the appellants submit that, in paragraph 60 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court wrongly rejected as inadmissible their plea alleging that the Commission was also bound by the 2006 decision.", "26      First, the appellants submit that the General Court neglected its role in finding that that plea was inadmissible on the ground that they had not precisely identified the 2006 decision.", "They maintain that that lack of precision is not attributable to them, since they had identified the investigation procedure initiated by the Commission in September 2005 and indicated the file number (CP 224/2005), but that that lack of precision is the consequence of the Commission’s refusal to grant their request for disclosure of that file.", "Having failed to exercise its powers of investigation to obtain production of that file, the General Court could not reject their argument as inadmissible on the ground that the decision on which they relied was not precisely identified.", "27      Secondly, the appellants submit that the other ground on which the General Court held that that plea was inadmissible, that is to say that it was out of time, is also incorrect.", "The reference to the 2006 decision in their reply does not constitute a new plea but a justification for their application at first instance.", "Furthermore, even if it were a new plea, it would have been admissible under Article 84(1) and (2) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court.", "According to the appellants, that plea was based on facts set out in paragraph 67 of that application, which appear uncontested only in the light of the Commission’s defence.", "The appellants stress that, even without the 2004 letter, the Commission was bound by its 2006 decision.", "28      The Commission contends that the second ground of appeal should be rejected.", "Findings of the Court", "29", "The plea in the application at first instance alleging that the Commission had found, in the 2006 decision, that the Czech scheme for the promotion of electricity production from RES did not constitute State aid and that, consequently, that institution could not have decided to the contrary by the decision at issue, was rejected by the General Court in paragraph 60 of the judgment under appeal, inter alia, on the ground that it had been put before it for the first time only in the reply and that, as a result, it constituted a new inadmissible plea.", "30", "It is common ground that that plea was only put forward for the first time in the reply.", "Furthermore, contrary to what the appellants claim, it cannot be regarded as the extension of the first plea in the action before the General Court, which alleged that the 2004 letter, by which the Commission had adopted a position on the proposed scheme for the promotion of electricity production from RES, was a decision.", "Moreover, the appellants were not in a position, either before the Court of Justice or the General Court, to provide reasons why that plea could not have been put forward earlier.", "Consequently, the General Court correctly applied Article 84(1) of its Rules of Procedure by rejecting that plea on the ground that it was out of time.", "31", "It follows that the second ground of appeal must be rejected.", "The third ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "32      By their third ground of appeal, the appellants criticise the General Court for failing to have regard to the conditions for a legitimate expectation to exist by refusing to accept that the 2004 letter, the 2006 decision and the conduct of the Commission between 2004 and the adoption of the decision at issue had created a legitimate expectation that the RES promotion scheme would be maintained.", "First, that court failed to take account of all the relevant circumstances and, as a result, disregarded the existence of exceptional circumstances that gave rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of the appellants.", "Secondly, the failure to take into account the evidence submitted by the appellants constitutes a breach of procedure.", "33      The Commission contends that the third ground of appeal should be rejected as unfounded and, in any event, as ineffective.", "Findings of the Court", "34", "According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, for infringement of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations to be established, it is necessary for an EU institution, by giving a citizen precise assurances, to have led that person to entertain justified expectations.", "Information which is precise, unconditional and consistent, in whatever form it is given, constitutes such assurances (judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 63).", "35", "In that regard, in its 2004 letter, the Commission merely expressed a preliminary opinion on a draft of the promotion scheme which was adopted only the following year, the precise conditions of which were not then fully known.", "Consequently, that letter did not give precise assurances that the initial scheme was not in the nature of State aid.", "Therefore, the General Court did not err in its legal characterisation by holding in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal that that letter could not give rise to any legitimate expectation.", "36", "Nor can the General Court be criticised for not taking the view that such an expectation could result from the alleged ‘2006 decision’.", "As the General Court pointed out in paragraph 60 of the judgment under appeal, that decision had not been placed on the file, nor even specifically identified by the appellants.", "37", "Nor do the appellants demonstrate that the General Court incorrectly characterised the Commission’s conduct between 2004 and the adoption of the decision at issue in finding, in paragraph 78 of the judgment under appeal, that that conduct could not be regarded as having provided precise, unconditional and consistent assurances that there was no State aid.", "38", "Moreover, the appellants may criticise the General Court for failing to take into account certain other factors, which they claim to have submitted to it, only if that evidence proves that they could rely on a legitimate expectation that the initial scheme for the promotion of electricity production from RES would be maintained.", "The appellants have not shown that that evidence was sufficient to justify the legitimate expectation alleged.", "39", "In particular, the appellants do not effectively challenge the finding, in paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal, that exceptional circumstances should not be taken into account in the present case, in so far as that consideration was envisaged, in the judgment of 11 July 1996, SFEI and Others (C‑39/94, EU:C:1996:285), only in order to establish that, in certain cases, the repayment of State aid sought before a national court is inappropriate.", "40", "It follows from the foregoing that the third ground of appeal must be rejected.", "The fourth ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "41      By their fourth ground of appeal, the appellants submit that the General Court wrongly concluded that there was State aid.", "42      In the first place, even if the initial promotion scheme involved a levy or a compulsory charge, the General Court did not take account of the two additional conditions, set out by the Court of Justice in paragraphs 83 to 85 of its judgment of 28 March 2019, Germany v Commission (C‑405/16 P, EU:C:2019:268), for a levy or a compulsory tax imposed on private parties to constitute State resources, namely, first, the existence of a link between the advantage in question and a reduction, at the very least potential, in the State budget and, secondly, the fact that the sums levied remain under public control.", "Under the initial promotion scheme, there was no link between the advantage granted to renewable energy producers and a reduction in the State budget.", "Nor did the General Court establish that the funds in question were available to the State, the requirement for which was laid down in paragraph 76 of that judgment, and not only under the dominant influence of the public authorities.", "Yet, those two conditions were characterised as ‘key factors’ by the Court of Justice in paragraph 83 of that judgment.", "43      In the second place and in any event, the General Court infringed EU law and committed a procedural irregularity in finding that there was a levy.", "First, Section 5(5) and (6) of Decree No 541/2005 of the ERO refers to an agreement and not to a levy or a compulsory charge.", "An agreement depends on the consent of the customer, so that, by definition, the ERO cannot introduce a levy or a compulsory charge.", "Secondly, paragraph 5 of ERO Decision No 14/2005 of 30 November 2005 on prices merely documents the applicable amount of the surcharge for renewable energy cost, without imposing an obligation.", "Thirdly, neither Decree No 541/2005, nor Decision No 14/2005 could have imposed that type of levy and invoicing obligation, given that, according to basic Czech legal principles, duties can be imposed on citizens only by legislation and not by decrees or decisions.", "Fourthly, the appellants submit that Section 32(1) of Decree No 541/2005 refers to ‘the price for the distribution or transmission of electricity services, price of the system service … and price of settlement performed by market operator’ and maintain that, if it could be inferred from that provision that there is an obligation to charge the renewable energy cost, the same conclusion would then have to be drawn for all elements of the price.", "Fifthly, in order to establish the existence of a compulsory charge, the General Court should have identified the law which imposed it and not inferred that fact, illogically in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, from the fact that it was not apparent from the provisions mentioned by the appellants that the electricity transmission system operator and the electricity distribution companies were not legally obliged to charge the final consumers for that levy.", "44      In the third place, the appellants submit that paragraph 90 of the judgment under appeal is vitiated by a procedural irregularity.", "The General Court relied on provisions which neither the Commission nor the Czech Republic had relied on, disregarded the expert opinions of the Czech law firm which they had produced, on the ground that those opinions did not constitute a full analysis, even though the Commission had not rebutted them, and refused to rely on the additional evidence adduced to verify the content of the Czech legislation.", "45      The Commission contends that the first part of the fourth ground of appeal should be rejected as unfounded and that the second and third parts should be rejected as inadmissible.", "Findings of the Court", "46", "By the first part of their fourth ground of appeal, the appellants, referring to the judgment of 28 March 2019, Germany v Commission (C‑405/16 P, EU:C:2019:268, paragraphs 83 to 85), submit that it is not sufficient that the initial promotion scheme was financed by a compulsory levy to enable it to be regarded as being financed through State resources.", "However, it must be pointed out that that argument is based on a misreading of that judgment.", "It is apparent from that judgment that the fact of coming from a compulsory levy is, on the contrary, sufficient to identify State resources (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 March 2019, Germany v Commission, C‑405/16 P, EU:C:2019:268, paragraphs 65 to 72).", "On the other hand, it is irrelevant that the financing mechanism at issue does not, strictly speaking, fall within the category of fiscal levies under national law (see, to that effect, order of 22 October 2014, Elcogás, C‑275/13, not published, EU:C:2014:2314, paragraph 31).", "The first part of the fourth ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.", "47", "By the second part of their fourth ground of appeal, the appellants submit that the General Court, in any event, infringed EU law and committed a procedural irregularity in finding that there was a compulsory levy.", "However, even if that finding were incorrect, that error would vitiate the interpretation of national law.", "The interpretation of national law by the General Court is not open to challenge before the appeal court, except where the facts have been distorted (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 79 and the case-law cited), which has not been alleged in the present case by the appellants.", "Accordingly, this part of that ground of appeal must also be rejected as inadmissible.", "48", "By the third part of their fourth ground of appeal, the appellants criticise the General Court for vitiating its judgment with a procedural irregularity by disregarding the evidence which they had adduced to the General Court or which they had proposed to be communicated to that court.", "However, that part, which does not indicate the elements which are being referred to, is presented in terms that are too imprecise to enable the Court to assess its merits,  with the result that it must also be rejected as inadmissible.", "49", "It follows from the foregoing that the fourth ground of appeal must be rejected.", "The fifth ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "50      By their fifth ground of appeal, the appellants submit that, in rejecting their plea alleging that the Commission imposed excessive requirements in its assessment of the compatibility of the measures at issue with the internal market, the General Court wrongly held, in paragraphs 130 to 136 of the judgment under appeal, that the requirement for a ‘review mechanism’ had not been imposed by the Commission and that that requirement was consistent with the 2008 Guidelines.", "First, the assertion in paragraph 131 of the judgment under appeal that the Czech Republic voluntarily undertook to implement that review mechanism contradicts that Member State’s statements.", "Secondly, that review mechanism, which the Commission required the Czech Republic to introduce, goes far beyond the requirements laid down in the 2008 Guidelines, which are applicable to the facts at issue, and consists rather in a significant reduction in the promotion of electricity production from RES.", "51      The Commission contends that the fifth ground of appeal should be rejected as inadmissible.", "Findings of the Court", "52", "The appellants submit, in essence, that, in paragraphs 130 to 136 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court wrongly held that the ‘review mechanism’ of the scheme for the promotion of electricity production from RES had not been imposed by the Commission on the Czech Republic and that that mechanism did not exceed the requirements laid down in the 2008 Guidelines applicable to the facts at issue.", "53", "However, first, the factual assessment that the Czech Republic voluntarily undertook to implement the ‘review mechanism’ does not, as is apparent from the case-law cited in paragraph 24 above, fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice when hearing an appeal, except where the facts have been distorted, which is not alleged by the appellants.", "Secondly, since the review mechanism must be regarded as having been introduced by the Czech Republic, any failure to comply with the 2008 Guidelines has no bearing on the General Court’s assessment of the legality of the decision at issue adopted by the Commission.", "54", "It follows from the foregoing that the fifth ground of appeal must be rejected.", "The sixth ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "55      By their sixth ground of appeal, the appellants criticise the General Court for rejecting the first part of the fifth plea and the seventh plea of their application at first instance on insufficient grounds.", "By the first part of the sixth ground of appeal, they submit that, in paragraph 139 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court wrongly rejected the fact that the Commission had committed a twofold factual error concerning the initial promotion scheme, since that scheme did not provide for the fixing of price levels and was not financed by a tax.", "By the second part of that ground of appeal, they submit that, by rejecting the seventh plea in their application at first instance on the twofold ground that it was merely a summary of the six previous pleas, which made it inadmissible under Article 76 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, and that the statements which it contained were ‘extremely summary’ and were ‘in no way substantiated’, the General Court failed to take account of the matters raised in paragraphs 11 to 18 and 109 of their reply.", "56      The Commission contends that the sixth ground of appeal should be rejected as inadmissible.", "Findings of the Court", "57", "First, assuming that the criticism that the General Court made a twofold error in finding that the initial promotion scheme provided for the fixing of tariff levels and was financed by a tax does not relate to an assessment of the facts, which does not as such fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice when hearing an appeal, it must be held that the appellants have not established that the General Court’s assessment on that point is incorrect.", "58", "Secondly, although by a second part of the sixth ground of appeal the appellants criticise the General Court’s rejection of the seventh plea in their action at first instance on the ground that it lacks precision, their arguments are themselves too imprecise to enable the Court of Justice’s to assess the merits.", "59", "Consequently, the sixth ground of appeal must be rejected.", "The seventh ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "60      By their seventh ground of appeal, the appellants submit, first, that the General Court misconstrued the scope of the second part of the fifth plea in their application at first instance, claiming that they were not informed of the Commission’s intention to rule on issues unrelated to State aid and, secondly, that the Commission failed to take account of their right to be involved in the administrative procedure to the appropriate extent given the circumstances of the case.", "61      The Commission contends that the seventh ground of appeal should be rejected as unfounded and, in any event, as inadmissible.", "Findings of the Court", "62", "It must be stated that the appellants set out the complaint which they criticise the General Court for having misunderstood in the same terms as paragraph 144 of the judgment under appeal.", "Thus, the first part of the seventh ground of appeal has no factual basis.", "As for the second part of this ground of appeal, it is ineffective, since it is not directed against the judgment under appeal.", "Furthermore, and in any event, the General Court held that the Commission had responded to the arguments raised during the administrative procedure, and that assessment is not open to challenge in an appeal, unless there has been a distortion of the facts, which is not alleged in the present case.", "63", "It follows that the seventh ground of appeal must be rejected.", "The eighth ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "64      By their eighth ground of appeal, the appellants criticise the grounds set out in paragraphs 157 to 163 of the judgment under appeal in which the General Court rejected the sixth plea in law in their application at first instance.", "They submit that, by the sixth plea, they claimed that the Commission had exceeded its powers by stating, in the decision at issue, first, that the Czech Republic had not infringed the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations under national law and, secondly, that any compensation granted, as the case may be, by an arbitration decision would in itself constitute State aid, would infringe Article 108 TFEU and could not therefore be enforced.", "First, the General Court disregarded the limits of the Commission’s competence by holding that those assertions did not exceed those limits.", "Secondly, the General Court wrongly held, in paragraphs 158 and 159 of the judgment under appeal, that those assertions were not such as to entail the annulment of the decision at issue in its entirety and should, in any event, have annulled that decision at least in part.", "Thirdly, the General Court erred in refusing to regard those assertions as indications of a misuse of powers.", "Fourthly, the argument set out in paragraph 160 of judgment under appeal that, where a decision pursues more than one aim, then, ‘even if the grounds of a decision include, in addition to proper grounds, an improper one, that would not make the decision invalid for misuse of powers, since it does not nullify the main aim’, is irrelevant, since no legitimate reason can justify the Commission taking a decision on issues which fall outside its competence.", "65      The Commission contends that this ground of appeal should be rejected as inadmissible for the most part and, in any event, as unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "66", "By their eighth ground of appeal, the appellants, in essence, criticise the General Court for not finding, in paragraphs 157 to 163 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had exceeded the limits of its powers by asserting in the decision at issue, first, that the Czech Republic had not infringed the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations under national law, and, secondly, that any compensation granted, as the case may be, by an arbitration decision in itself constitutes State aid, infringes Article 108 TFEU and cannot therefore be enforced.", "In paragraphs 160 and 161 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court also erred in refusing to identify, in those assertions, the evidence of misuse of powers.", "67", "It is common ground that the Commission stated in the decision at issue, first, that the Czech Republic had not infringed the principle of legitimate expectations under national law and, secondly, that any compensation which an arbitration tribunal might grant would, in itself, constitute State aid, would infringe Article 108 TFEU and would therefore not be enforceable.", "However, as the General Court found in paragraphs 158 and 159 of the judgment under appeal, those assertions do not form part of the necessary grounds for the decision at issue.", "Therefore, the General Court was fully entitled to reject as ineffective the complaints alleging that those assertions were unlawful.", "Moreover, in paragraph 158 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court expressly accepted that the Commission lacked competence to make a decision on compliance with the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations under national law.", "68", "As regards the existence of a misuse of powers, which the General Court did not take into account, it should be recalled that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the value which should be attached to the evidence produced to it where, as in the present case, there is no allegation of distortion of that evidence.", "69", "Accordingly, the eighth ground of appeal must be rejected.", "70", "It follows from all of the foregoing that the main appeal must be dismissed.", "The cross-appeal", "71      As stated in paragraph 11 above, the Commission has asked the Court of Justice to rule on its cross-appeal only in the event that the Court should uphold the main appeal.", "Since the main appeal is dismissed, the cross-appeal is therefore devoid of purpose.", "Costs", "72      Under Article 138(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, which applies to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "73      In the present case, since the Court has dismissed the main appeal and the Commission has sought an order for costs against the appellants, the latter must be ordered to pay the costs relating to the main appeal.", "74      Under Article 142 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, which applies to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, where a case does not proceed to judgment, the costs are to be in the discretion of the Court.", "75      In the present case, since the Court of Justice has declared the cross-appeal to be devoid of purpose, it is appropriate to order the appellants and the Commission to bear their own costs relating to the cross-appeal.", "76      Under Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, which also applies to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, Member States which intervene in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.", "77      Accordingly, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Poland, the Czech Republic, the Kingdom of Spain and the Slovak Republic are to bear their own costs.", "On those

(OJ 2011 L 34, p. 55) (‘the decision at issue’).", "Legal context", "2", "Hungary has regulated all mining activities, including those relating to hydrocarbons, by Act XLVIII of 1993 on mining activities (1993. évi XLVIII. törvény a bányászatról) (‘the Mining Act’).", "Pursuant to that act, regulatory functions are exercised by the Minister for Mines and by the Mining Authority, which supervises mining activities.", "3", "The Mining Act provides that mining exploration and activities may be carried out under two different legal regimes.", "For areas categorised as ‘closed’, Articles 8 to 19 of the Mining Act establish a regime in which, following an open tendering procedure for each closed area, a concession is granted on the basis of a contract concluded between the Minister for Mines and the winner of the open tender competition.", "Areas categorised as ‘open’, a priori considered less rich in mineral raw materials, may be exploited by way of authorisation issued by the Mining Authority, provided the operator fulfils the legal conditions.", "4", "Article 20 of the Mining Act establishes the rules for fixing the mining fees which must be paid to the State.", "Article 20(11) provides that the amount of the mining fee is a percentage defined, as the case may be, in the Mining Act, in the concession contract or in the contract concluded pursuant to Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act.", "Article 20(2) to (7) of that act provides that for mineral resources extracted under the authorisation regime, the fee is regulated by the Mining Act.", "5", "Before 2008, the mining fee for the extraction of hydrocarbons, crude oil and natural gas under authorisation was fixed at 12% of the value of the quantity extracted for fields put into production from 1 January 1998 onwards or was derived from the application of a mathematical formula which took into account the average price of natural gas purchased by the public gas service, subject to a floor of 12%, for natural gas fields put into production before 1 January 1998.", "6", "Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act provides that where, under the authorisation regime, that is to say for fields located in open areas, a mining company does not start extraction within five years of the date of authorisation, it may ask the Mining Authority, once only, to extend this deadline by no more than five years.", "If the Mining Authority agrees to this, a contract between the Minister in charge of mining issues and the mining company establishes, for the fields which are the subject of that extension, the quantity of materials to be used as a basis for calculating the mining fee and the rate of that fee, which must be higher than the rate applicable at the date of the extension application, but no more than 1.2 times that rate (‘the extension fee’).", "If the extension application concerns more than two fields, the rate of the extension fee is applied to all of the mining company’s fields by a contract entered into for a period of at least five years (‘the increased mining fee’).", "If the extension application concerns more than five fields, a special fee may be required, corresponding to a maximum of 20% of the amount payable on the basis of the increased mining fee.", "7", "Act CXXXIII of 2007 on mining activities amending the Mining Act (2007. évi CXXXIII. törvény a bányászatról szóló 1993. évi XLVIII. törvény módosításáról) (‘the 2008 amendment’), which came into force on 8 January 2008, amended the rate of the mining fee.", "8", "Thus, following this amendment, Article 20(3) of the Mining Act provides for a rate of 30% of the value of the quantity extracted for fields put into production between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2007, for the existing mathematical formula under the Mining Act regime to be applied to natural gas fields put into production before 1 January 1998, subject to a floor of 30%, and for a differentiated mining fee to be applied to fields where production began after 1 January 2008, according to the quantity of crude oil or natural gas extracted, that is to say, a rate of 12% where the annual quantity produced does not exceed 300 million m3 of natural gas or 50 kt of crude oil, a rate of 20% for production between 300 million m3 of natural gas and 500 million m3 of natural gas or between 50 kt of crude oil and 200 kt of crude oil and a rate of 30% for production over 500 million m3 of natural gas or 200 kt of crude oil.", "Finally, for all fields, regardless of the date on which they were brought into production, the mining fee payable is increased by 3% or 6% if the price of Brent crude oil exceeds 80 United States dollars (USD) or 90 USD respectively.", "9", "Article 235 of Act LXXXI of 2008

production between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2007 and the minimum mining fee payable for natural gas fields put into production before 1 January 1998.", "That amendment entered into force on 23 January 2009.", "Background to the dispute", "10", "MOL Magyar Olaj- és Gázipari Nyrt. (‘MOL’) is a company established in Budapest (Hungary) which has as its core activities the exploration for, and production of, crude oil, natural gas and gas products, the transportation, storage and distribution of crude oil products at both retail and wholesale levels, the transmission of natural gas and the production and sale of alkenes and polyolefins.", "11", "On 19 September 2005, MOL sought extension of the mining rights for 12 of its hydrocarbon fields for which authorisation had been obtained but where extraction had not started.", "12", "On 22 December 2005, the Minister for Mines and MOL concluded an extension agreement pursuant to Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act (‘the 2005 agreement’), granting a five-year extension of the deadline to start exploiting those 12 hydrocarbon fields and setting the extension fee to be paid by MOL to the State as follows: for Year 1, 12% x 1.050 = 12.600%; for Year 2, 12% x 1.038 = 12.456%; for Year 3, 12% x 1.025 = 12.300%; and, for Years 4 and 5, 12% x 1.020 = 12.240%.", "13", "Under point 4 of the 2005 agreement, the increased mining fee applies for a period of 15 years from the date when that agreement came into effect to all MOL’s fields already exploited under authorisation, that is to say, 44 hydrocarbon fields where production started after 1 January 1998 and 93 natural gas fields where production started before that date.", "The rate of the increased mining fee for the fifth year of the extension period applies until the 15th year.", "In respect of the natural gas fields, the multiplier for each of the five years of extension applies to the mathematical formula established by Article 20(3)(b) of the Mining Act, with the multiplier for the fifth year applying until the 15th year.", "14", "Point 6 of the 2005 agreement provides for payment of a special fee of 20000 million Hungarian forints (HUF).", "15", "Point 9 of that agreement provides that the rate of the extension fee, the rate of the increased mining fee, the basis of calculation, the percentage and all the factors used to calculate those fees are determined, for the entire duration of the 2005 agreement, exclusively by the provisions of that agreement and that the rates defined in that agreement will remain unchanged or constant for its entire duration.", "16", "Point 11 of the 2005 agreement prohibits the parties from unilaterally terminating that agreement, save in the case in which a third party were to acquire more than 25% of MOL’s capital.", "It also provides that the agreement comes into force as of the date on which the Mining Authority’s resolution takes effect.", "That resolution was passed on 23 December 2005, effectively confirming the extension of the deadline to start exploiting the 12 hydrocarbon fields and the payments to be made by MOL and determined by that agreement.", "17", "Following a complaint received on 14 November 2007, the Commission, by letter of 13 January 2009, informed the Hungarian authorities of its decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure provided for in Article 88(2) EC with respect to the 2005 agreement, in so far as it exempted MOL from the mining fee increase resulting from the 2008 amendment.", "The Commission considered that the 2005 agreement and the provisions of the 2008 amendment were part of the same measure (‘the measure at issue’), which had the effect of conferring an unfair advantage on MOL, and therefore constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC.", "By letter of 9 April 2009, Hungary submitted its comments on the decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure, denying that that measure constitutes State aid.", "18", "Following on from the observations filed by MOL and the Magyar Bányászati Szövetség (Hungarian Mining Association), and after Hungary had sent, on 21 September 2009 and 12 January 2010, documents requested by the Commission, on 9 June 2010 the Commission adopted the decision at issue according to which the measure at issue constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, incompatible with the common market, and ordering Hungary to recover the aid from MOL.", "Procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal", "19", "By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 8 October 2010, MOL brought an action, primarily, for annulment of the decision at issue , or, in the alternative, for the annulment of that decision in so far as it orders recovery of the amounts concerned .", "20", "MOL raised three pleas in law in support of its action, alleging, respectively, infringement of Article 107(1) TFEU and Article 108(1) TFEU, and infringement of Article 1(b)(v) and Article 14(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 108 of the [TFEU] (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1).", "21", "In its first plea, MOL contested the categorisation of the measure at issue as State aid.", "22", "The General Court examined in particular the second argument raised within that plea, alleging that the measure at issue was not selective.", "In that regard, the General Court first stated in paragraph 54 of the judgment under appeal that the application of Article 107(1) TFEU requires it to be determined whether, under a particular statutory scheme, a state measure is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over others which are in a comparable legal and factual situation in the light of the objective pursued by that scheme.", "23", "Next, the General Court stated, in paragraph 62 of the judgment under appeal, that, in the present case, the contested measure consists of two elements, that is to say, the 2005 agreement, which sets the mining fee rates for all of MOL’s fields, whether in production or subject to an extension, for each of the 15 years of its duration, and the 2008 amendment, which increases mining fee rates for all hydrocarbon fields under authorisation, but does not contain any provisions relating to fields that have already been subject to an extension agreement.", "24", "Finally, the General Court stated in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal that the fees stipulated by the 2005 agreement, which applied both to fields already in production and to fields concerned by the extension of authorisation, were higher than the statutory fees applicable at the time of its conclusion, and it concluded that that agreement did not involve any State aid element for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU.", "25", "In paragraphs 64 and 65 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court also held, that where a Member State concludes with an economic operator an agreement which does not involve any State aid element for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU, the fact that, subsequently, conditions external to such an agreement change in such a way as to confer an advantage on that operator is not a sufficient basis on which to conclude that, together, the agreement and the subsequent modification of the conditions external to that agreement may be regarded as constituting State aid.", "26", "However, the General Court considered in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal that the situation would be different if the terms of the agreement concluded were proposed selectively by the State to one or more operators rather than on the basis of objective criteria, laid down by a text of general application, applicable to any operator.", "The General Court, however, pointed out that the fact that only one operator has concluded an agreement of that type may result, inter alia, from an absence of interest by any other operator, and is not sufficient therefore to establish the selective nature of that agreement.", "27", "Finally, the General Court observed in paragraph 67 of the judgment under appeal that, for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU, a combination of elements may be categorised as State aid if, having regard to their chronology, their purpose and the circumstances of the undertaking at the time of their intervention, those elements are so closely linked to each other that they are inseparable from one another (see, to that effect, judgment in Bouygues and Bouygues Télécom v Commission and Others and Commission v France and Others, C‑399/10 P and C‑401/10 P, EU:C:2013:175, paragraphs 103 and 104).", "28", "The General Court concluded that a combination of elements such as that mentioned by the Commission in the decision at issue may be categorised as State aid where the State acts in such a way as to protect one or more operators already present on the market, by concluding with them an agreement granting them fee rates guaranteed for the entire duration of that agreement, whilst having the intention of subsequently exercising its regulatory power by increasing the fee rate so that other market operators, new or already present on the market, are placed at a disadvantage.", "29", "It is in the light of those considerations that the General Court examined whether, in the present case, the Commission was right to find that the contested measure was selective.", "30", "In the first place, the General Court, in paragraphs 70 to 73 of the judgment under appeal, examined the legal framework governing the conclusion of the 2005 agreement.", "It stated in that regard that Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act, which makes it possible to apply for an extension of the mining rights, does not appear to be a provision of a selective nature; nor can it be inferred from that provision that the Hungarian authorities may refuse to open negotiations with a view to concluding such an agreement.", "The General Court also found that, even if that provision provides that any mining undertaking may make an application to extend its mining rights, such an undertaking may, however, decide not to make that application or not to accept the rates proposed by the Hungarian authorities so that there is no resulting agreement.", "31", "With regard to the margin of assessment granted to the Hungarian authorities by Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act in relation to the rate of the extension fee, which determines, where applicable, that of the increased mining fee, the General Court found that such a margin of assessment cannot automatically be regarded as favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods over others and, thus, conferring a selective nature on the extension agreements concluded, given that it may be justified by various factors, such as the number of fields for which an extension has been granted and their estimated importance in relation to the fields already in production.", "32", "In the present case, the General Court found that the margin of assessment conferred by Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act is such as to enable the administration to preserve equal treatment between operators according to whether they are in comparable or different situations, by adjusting its proposed fees to the characteristics of each extension application submitted, and that it appears to be the expression of a latitude limited by objective criteria, which are not unrelated to the system of fees established by the legislation in question.", "According to the General Court, that margin of assessment can be distinguished, by its nature, from cases where the exercise of such a margin is connected with the grant of an advantage in favour of an economic operator, since, in the present case, it allows the fixing of an additional charge on economic operators in such a manner as to take account of the imperatives arising from the principle of equal treatment.", "33", "Furthermore, the General Court stated in paragraph 73 of the judgment under appeal that it follows from Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act that the rates of the extension fee and, where applicable, the rates of the increased mining fee are determined exclusively by the extension agreement, in accordance with Article 20(11) of the Mining Act.", "34", "The General Court concluded in paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal that the fact that the rates set by year of validity are the result of negotiation does not suffice to confer on the 2005 agreement a selective character, and that the situation would have been different only if the Hungarian authorities had exercised their margin of assessment during the negotiations resulting in that agreement in such a way as to favour MOL by agreeing to a low fee level without any objective reason having regard to the rationale of increasing fees in the event of an extension of authorisation and to the detriment of any other operator having sought to extend its mining rights or, failing such an operator, where there is concrete evidence that unjustified favourable treatment had been reserved to MOL.", "35", "In the second place, the General Court examined whether the selective nature of the 2005 agreement had been demonstrated by the Commission, inter alia, in the light of the clause setting the precise rate of the increased mining fee for each of the 15 years of the period of validity of that agreement, and of the clause providing that those rates remain unchanged.", "36", "In that regard, the General Court observed in paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal that the Mining Act is drafted in general terms as regards the undertakings that may benefit from the provisions of Article 26/A(5) of that act.", "The General Court also found in paragraph 77 of the judgment under appeal that, in the decision at issue, the Commission merely found that MOL was the only undertaking in practice to have concluded an extension agreement in the hydrocarbons sector.", "However, according to the General Court, this may be explained by an absence of interest on the part of other operators, and thus by an absence of any extension application or any agreement between the parties on the rates of the extension fee.", "The General Court concluded that, in the two latter cases, since the criteria laid down by the Mining Act for the conclusion of an extension agreement are objective and applicable to any potentially interested operator fulfilling those criteria, the conclusion of the 2005 agreement cannot be regarded as being of a selective nature.", "37", "Furthermore, the General Court found in paragraph 78 of the judgment under appeal that by setting the rate of the increased mining fee for each of the 15 years of the period of validity of the 2005 agreement and by providing that those rates would remain unchanged, MOL and Hungary merely applied the provisions of Article 20(11) and Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act.", "38", "Next, the General Court emphasised in paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal that the rates stipulated in the 2005 agreement apply to all of MOL’s fields already in production under authorisation, that is, to 44 hydrocarbon fields and to 93 natural gas fields, whereas the extension concerns only 12 other fields not in production at the time of conclusion of the agreement.", "Therefore, the fact that the multiplier is below the ceiling of 1.2, and specifically between 1.02 and 1.05, may be explained objectively by the limited significance of the fields concerned by the extension in relation to the fields already in production in 2005.", "The Commission having failed to examine that aspect, the General Court considered that no evidence of MOL’s unjustified preferential treatment is apparent from the decision at issue, and that it cannot be assumed that MOL was afforded favourable treatment in relation to any other undertaking that was potentially in a comparable situation.", "39", "Finally, the General Court found in paragraph 80 of the judgment under appeal that, although the Commission mentioned the existence of other extension agreements concluded by mining undertakings in the solid minerals sector, it did not attempt to find any more information about them from the Hungarian authorities and did not take account of them in the decision at issue, from which it is clear, moreover, that the selective nature of the measure at issue stems from the selectivity of the 2005 agreement and not from the nature of the minerals extracted, the rates of fees applicable to those categories of minerals or from the fact that those rates were not subsequently modified.", "The General Court concluded that, by its approach, the Commission did not take account of all the factors which would have enabled it to assess whether the 2005 agreement was selective as regards MOL in the light of the situation created by other extension agreements also concluded on the basis of Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act.", "40", "In the light of all those considerations, the General Court concluded in paragraph 81 of the judgment under appeal that the selective nature of the 2005 agreement could not be regarded as established.", "41", "In addition, the General Court stated, in paragraph 82 of the judgment under appeal, that the increase in fees under the amended Mining Act, which entered into force in 2008, occurred in a context of an increase in international crude oil prices.", "It inferred from this that, since the Commission had not argued that the 2005 agreement had been concluded in anticipation of an increase in mining fees, the combination of that agreement with the amended Mining Act could not validly be categorised as State aid for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU.", "42", "Consequently, the General Court upheld the action brought by MOL and annulled the decision at issue .", "The appeal", "43", "In support of its appeal, the Commission relies on a single ground, alleging an error of law, in that the General Court misinterpreted and misapplied the condition of selectivity laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU.", "44", "The ground of appeal is divided into four parts.", "Preliminary observations", "45", "Under Article 107(1) TFEU, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the provision of certain goods is to be incompatible with the common market, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, save as otherwise provided for in the Treaties.", "46", "According to settled case-law of the Court, for a measure to be categorised as aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, all the conditions set out in that provision must be fulfilled (see judgment in Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 38 and the case-law cited).", "47", "It is thus well established that, for a national measure to be categorised as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, there must, first, be an intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer an advantage on the recipient and, fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see judgment in Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).", "48", "In the present case, it is only the interpretation and application of the third condition, that the measure at issue must confer a selective advantage on the recipient, that are called into question.", "The first part of the single ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "49", "The Commission criticises the General Court’s analysis of the legal framework governing the conclusion of the 2005 agreement and, in particular, the discretion enjoyed by the Hungarian authorities with regard to the choice of whether or not to conclude an extension agreement and with regard to the level of the fee which they set in such an agreement.", "50", "In the first place, the Commission claims that the General Court’s examination, in paragraphs 70 to 74 and 79 to 81 of the judgment under appeal, of the discretion enjoyed by the Hungarian authorities in concluding an extension agreement is legally flawed.", "51", "The General Court did not find that the Hungarian authorities are required to conclude an extension agreement following negotiations, but stated in paragraph 57 of the judgment under appeal that, according to Hungary, ‘the conclusion of such an agreement was not obligatory’, then found in paragraph 77 of that judgment that the fact that MOL is the only hydrocarbons producer to have concluded an extension agreement may be explained by there being no agreement between the parties on the rates of the extension fee.", "52", "It is therefore clear from the judgment under appeal that the Mining Act confers on the Hungarian authorities a discretion enabling them to approve of or object to the conclusion of an extension agreement, which is not subject to objective criteria and is therefore selective in nature.", "The Commission also claims that the fact that the mining undertakings have the choice of whether or not to apply for an extension, as the General Court pointed out in paragraph 71 of the judgment under appeal, is not relevant in that regard.", "53", "Consequently, the General Court’s conclusion in paragraph 83 of the judgment under appeal that the selective nature of the measure at issue has not been established should be reviewed.", "54", "That conclusion contradicts the case-law of the Court of Justice, in particular the judgment in France v Commission (C‑241/94, EU:C:1996:353, paragraphs 23 and 24), in which the Court of Justice found that, by virtue of its aim and general scheme, the system at issue was liable to place certain undertakings in a more favourable situation than others since the competent authority enjoyed a degree of latitude which enabled it to adjust its financial assistance having regard to various considerations such as, in particular, the choice of the beneficiaries, the amount of financial assistance and the conditions under which it was provided.", "It also disregarded the judgment in P (C‑6/12, EU:C:2013:525, paragraph 27), in which the Court of Justice held that, when national legislation confers a discretion on national authorities with regard to the detailed rules for the application of the measure at issue, the decisions of those authorities lack selectivity only if that discretion is limited by objective criteria, which are not connected with the system put in place by the legislation in question.", "55", "In the second place, the Commission claims that the General Court’s analysis is also incorrect in that it disregards the discretion conferred on the Hungarian authorities as regards the level of the mining fee set by them in an extension agreement.", "That is liable to render the 2005 agreement selective.", "56", "According to the Commission, the reasons given by the General Court in paragraph 72 of the judgment under appeal, that the margin of assessment is such as to enable the administration to preserve equal treatment between operators, are not presented in the national legislative framework as factors determining the measure in which the mining fee must be increased and therefore constitute mere suppositions.", "Consequently, the General Court disregarded the case-law of the Court of Justice, in particular, the judgments in France v Commission (C‑241/94, EU:C:1996:353); Ecotrade (C‑200/97, EU:C:1998:579); Piaggio (C‑295/97, EU:C:1999:313); DM Transport (C‑256/97, EU:C:1999:332); P (C‑6/12, EU:C:2013:525); Ministerio de Defensa and Navantia (C‑522/13, EU:C:2014:2262); and British Telecommunications v Commission (C‑620/13 P, EU:C:2014:2309).", "57", "Furthermore, the Commission claims that, contrary to what the General Court stated in paragraph 72 of the judgment under appeal, the fact that the 2005 agreement gave rise to a charge for MOL at the time that agreement was concluded does not mean that it is not selective.", "58", "MOL disputes the Commission’s line of argument contending, first, that it is not apparent from the judgment under appeal that Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act leaves the Hungarian authorities a margin of discretion with regard to the conclusion of an extension agreement, and secondly, that the case-law relied on by the Commission is not relevant in the present case.", "Findings of the Court", "59", "It must be observed at the outset that, as the Advocate General stated in point 47 of his Opinion, the requirement as to selectivity under Article 107(1) TFEU must be clearly distinguished from the concomitant detection of an economic advantage, in that, where the Commission has identified an advantage, understood in a broad sense, as arising directly or indirectly from a particular measure, it is also required to establish that that advantage specifically benefits one or more undertakings.", "It falls to the Commission to show that the measure, in particular, creates differences between undertakings which, with regard to the objective of the measure, are in a comparable situation.", "It is necessary therefore that the advantage be granted selectively and that it be liable to place certain undertakings in a more favourable situation than that of others.", "60", "It must, however, be noted that the selectivity requirement differs depending on whether the measure in question is envisaged as a general scheme of aid or as individual aid.", "In the latter case, the identification of the economic advantage is, in principle, sufficient to support the presumption that it is selective.", "By contrast, when examining a general scheme of aid, it is necessary to identify whether the measure in question, notwithstanding the finding that it confers an advantage of general application, does so to the exclusive benefit of certain undertakings or certain sectors of activity .", "61", "It follows that the appropriate comparator for establishing the selectivity of the measure at issue in the present case was to ascertain whether the procedure for concluding and setting the terms and conditions of the agreement extending mining rights, laid down in Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act, draws a distinction between operators that are, in the light of the objective of the measure, in a comparable factual and legal situation, a distinction not justified by the nature and general scheme of the system at issue .", "62", "It follows from those considerations that the present case must be clearly distinguished from those cases giving rise to the case-law mentioned by the Commission in support of its arguments, set out in paragraphs 54 and 56 above, seeking to criticise the analysis made by the General Court of the legal framework governing the 2005 agreement.", "63", "Those cases relate to provisions of national law granting relief on taxes or other charges (judgments in France v Commission, C‑241/94, EU:C:1996:353; Piaggio, C‑295/97, EU:C:1999:313; DM Transport, C‑256/97, EU:C:1999:332; P, C‑6/12, EU:C:2013:525; Ministerio de Defensa and Navantia, C‑522/13, EU:C:2014:2262; and British Telecommunications v Commission, C‑620/13 P, EU:C:2014:2309), or exceptions in matters of insolvency (judgment in Ecotrade, C‑200/97, EU:C:1998:579).", "64", "As the Advocate General stated in point 86 of his Opinion, there is a fundamental difference between, on the one hand, the assessment of the selectivity of general schemes for exemption or relief, which, by definition, confer an advantage, and, on the other, the assessment of the selectivity of optional provisions of national law prescribing the imposition of additional charges.", "In cases in which the national authorities impose such charges in order to maintain equal treatment between operators, the simple fact that those authorities enjoy discretion defined by law, and not unlimited, as the Commission claimed in its appeal, cannot be sufficient to establish that the corresponding scheme is selective .", "65", "Consequently, it must be stated, first, that the General Court correctly held in paragraph 72 of the judgment under appeal that the margin of assessment at issue in the present case allows the fixing of an additional charge imposed on economic operators in order to take account of the imperatives arising from the principle of equal treatment, and can be distinguished, by its very nature, from cases in which the exercise of such a margin is connected with the grant of an advantage in favour of a specific economic operator.", "66", "Secondly, it cannot validly be argued that the General Court erred in law by finding, in paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal that the fact that the rates set by year of validity of the 2005 agreement are the result of negotiation does not suffice to confer on that agreement a selective character, and that the situation would have been different only if the Hungarian authorities had exercised their margin of assessment in such a way as to favour MOL by agreeing to a low fee level without any objective reason having regard to the rationale of increasing fees in the event of an extension of authorisation and to the detriment of any other operator having sought to extend its mining rights or, if there is no such operator, where there is concrete evidence that unjustified favourable treatment has been reserved to MOL.", "67", "In addition, in order to determine whether the selective nature of the 2005 agreement had been demonstrated by the Commission, the General Court first analysed, in paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal, the rates stipulated under that agreement and found that no evidence of unjustified preferential treatment of MOL was apparent from the decision at issue, and that therefore it could not be assumed that MOL was afforded favourable treatment in relation to any other undertaking that was potentially in a situation comparable to its own for the purposes of the case-law cited in paragraph 54 of the judgment under appeal.", "68", "Secondly, the General Court found in paragraph 80 of the judgment under appeal that, although the Commission had mentioned that there were other extension agreements in the solid minerals sector, it did not take account of them, and that in doing so it did not take into consideration all the factors by means of which it would have been in a position to assess whether the 2005 agreement was selective as regards MOL in the light of the situation created by other agreements extending mining rights, also concluded on the basis of Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act.", "69", "Following the analysis carried out in paragraphs 70 to 74 and 79 to 80 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court was right to conclude, in paragraph 81 of that judgment, that, in the light, first, of the absence of selectivity characterising the legal framework governing the conclusion of agreements extending mining rights and given the considerations justifying the grant of a margin of assessment, and secondly, of the absence of any evidence that those authorities treated MOL favourably in relation to any other undertaking in a comparable situation, the selective nature of the 2005 agreement cannot be regarded as established.", "70", "In the light of all the above considerations, it must be held that the General Court did not err in law in its examination, in paragraphs 70 to 74 and 79 to 81 of the judgment under appeal, of the legal framework governing the conclusion of the 2005 agreement.", "71", "The first part of the single ground of appeal must, therefore, be rejected as unfounded.", "Second part of the single ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "72", "The Commission claims that, in holding in paragraphs 76 to 78 of the judgment under appeal that the presence of objective criteria necessarily rules out any possibility of selectivity, the General Court disregarded the case-law of the Court of Justice to the effect that reliance on objective criteria in order to determine whether certain undertakings are covered by a national measure does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that there was no selectivity (see, to that effect, judgments in Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92, paragraph 49, and GEMO, C‑126/01, EU:C:2003:622, paragraphs 35 and 39).", "73", "It is therefore appropriate, in the Commission’s view, to review paragraphs 76 to 78 of the judgment under appeal and the General Court’s conclusion in paragraphs 81 and 83 of that judgment that the selective nature of the 2005 agreement and the measure at issue cannot be regarded as having been established.", "74", "MOL contends that the Commission’s arguments are based on a misreading of the judgment under appeal and that the case-law cited by the Commission is not relevant in the present case.", "Findings of the Court", "75", "It must be stated that, in paragraphs 76 to 78 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court analysed the legal framework governing the conclusion of agreements extending mining rights, including the 2005 agreement, as provided for in Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act.", "76", "In order to do so, the General Court examined whether or not the mining fee rate was set on the basis of objective criteria applicable to any potentially interested operator.", "Thus, the General Court noted first, in paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal, that the Mining Act was drafted in general terms as regards the undertakings eligible for the extension of mining rights.", "Next, the General Court found, in paragraph 77 of that judgment, that the fact that MOL was the only undertaking to have concluded an extension agreement in the hydrocarbons sector did not necessarily constitute evidence of selectivity, since the criteria for concluding such an agreement are objective and applicable to any potentially interested operator, and the absence of other agreements may result from decisions by undertakings themselves not to apply for an extension of mining rights.", "Lastly, the General Court stated, in paragraph 78 of the judgment under appeal, that the mining fees set for the term of the 2005 agreement stem simply from the application of the provisions of the Mining Act .", "77", "It follows from those arguments that, in criticising the General Court for holding that the presence of objective criteria necessarily rules out any possibility of selectivity and for having consequently disregarded the case-law to the effect that a particular aid scheme cannot be cleared of being selective solely on the ground that the beneficiaries are selected on the basis of objective criteria (judgments in Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92, paragraph 49, and GEMO, C‑126/01, EU:C:2003:622, paragraphs 35 and 39), the Commission misreads the judgment under appeal.", "78", "In any event, it must be stated that, as MOL contends, in the cases giving rise to those judgments, the Court of Justice addressed the issue of whether or not the beneficiaries of State aid schemes were selected on the basis of objective criteria.", "Thus, in particular in the judgment in GEMO (C‑126/01, EU:C:2003:622), the Court found that, despite the fact that the beneficiaries of the scheme adopted by national law were defined on the basis of objective and apparently general criteria, the benefits of that law accrued largely to farmers and slaughterhouses .", "79", "As the Advocate General stated in point 91 of his Opinion, that issue is not in question in the present case, so that the case-law arising from those judgments is not relevant in these proceedings.", "80", "Therefore, the second part of the single ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "The third and fourth parts of the single ground of appeal", "81", "Since the arguments set out in support of the third and fourth parts of the single ground of appeal are closely connected, it is appropriate to examine them together.", "Arguments of the parties", "82", "In essence, the Commission criticises the General Court for holding, in paragraphs 64 and 65 of the judgment under appeal, that the presence of a selective advantage cannot be deduced from the mere fact that the operator is left better off than other operators, when the Member State concerned justifiably confined itself to exercising its regulatory power following a change on the market.", "83", "The Commission argues that, in doing so, the General Court disregarded the case-law to the effect that, for the purposes of the application of Article 107(1) TFEU, it makes no difference whether the situation of the presumed beneficiary of the measure in question is better or worse over time (judgments in Greece v Commission, 57/86, EU:C:1988:284, paragraph 10, and Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer andamp; Peggauer Zementwerke, C‑143/99, EU:C:2001:598, paragraph 41).", "84", "According to the Commission, what is relevant, is that, after 8 January 2008, MOL was the only undertaking to enjoy preferential treatment in relation to the level of the mining fee applicable to hydrocarbon fields.", "85", "In addition, the Commission claims, first, that, since the change at issue was a legislative amendment on which the Member State was free to decide as it saw fit, the approach followed by the General Court authorises Member States to argue that measures are not selective by reason of the methods they use.", "Secondly, in paragraphs 67 and 82 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court was wrong to link the assessment of the selective nature of the 2005 agreement, and therefore the measure at issue, to whether or not the Member State concerned had the intention, at the time of concluding that agreement, of protecting one or more operators from the application of a new fee regime, in this instance, the regime introduced by the 2008 amendment.", "86", "According to the Commission, the General Court thus disregarded the settled case-law of the Court of Justice to the effect that Article 107(1) TFEU defines State interventions on the basis of their effects, and independently of the techniques used by the Member States to implement their interventions (see, inter alia, judgments in Belgium v Commission, C‑56/93, EU:C:1996:64, paragraph 79; Belgium v Commission, C‑75/97, EU:C:1999:311, paragraph 25; British Aggregates v Commission, C‑487/06 P, EU:C:2008:757, paragraph 89; and Commission v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 91, 92 and 98).", "87", "MOL contends that the third and fourth parts of the single ground of appeal must be rejected given that, contrary to what the Commission claims, paragraphs 64, 65, 67 and 82 of the judgment under appeal do not concern selectivity.", "Findings of the Court", "88", "As a preliminary point, it must be stated that, in paragraphs 62 and 63 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court observed that the contested measure consists of two elements, namely, the 2005 agreement and the 2008 amendment, and found that that agreement did not involve any element of State aid for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU.", "89", "In that context, the General Court first of all held, in paragraph 64 of the judgment under appeal, that, where a Member State concludes with an economic operator an agreement which does not involve any element of State aid for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU, the fact that, subsequently, conditions external to such an agreement change in such a way that the operator in question is in an advantageous position vis-à-vis other operators that have not concluded a similar agreement is not a sufficient basis on which to conclude that, together, the agreement and the subsequent modification of the conditions external to that agreement can be regarded as constituting State aid .", "90", "Next, the General Court made it clear, in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, that, if that were not the case, any agreement that an economic operator might conclude with a State which does not involve any element of State aid for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU would always be open to challenge, when the situation on the market on which the operator party to the agreement is active evolves in such a way that an advantage is conferred on that operator, as described in paragraph 64 of the judgment under appeal, or when the State exercises its regulatory power in an objectively justified manner following a market evolution while observing the rights and obligations resulting from such an agreement.", "91", "Finally, the General Court held in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal that a combination of elements such as that observed by the Commission in the decision at issue may be categorised as State aid where the terms of the agreement concluded were proposed selectively by the State to one or more operators rather than on the basis of objective criteria, laid down by a text of general application, applicable to any operator.", "The General Court made it clear in that regard that the fact that only one operator concluded an agreement of that type is not sufficient to establish the selective nature of the agreement, since that may result from, inter alia, lack of interest on the part of any other operator.", "92", "Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 67 of the judgment under appeal, that the case-law of the Court of Justice, according to which, for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU, a single aid measure may consist of combined elements on condition that, having regard to their chronology, their purpose and the circumstances of the undertaking at the time of their intervention, they are so closely linked to each other that they are inseparable from one another (judgment in Bouygues and Bouygues Télécom v Commission and Others and Commission v France and Others, C‑399/10 P and C‑401/10 P, EU:C:2013:175, paragraphs 103 and 104 and the case-law cited).", "93", "In that context, the General Court emphasised, in paragraph 67 of the judgment under appeal, that a combination of elements such as that relied upon by the Commission in the decision at issue may be categorised as State aid when the State acts in such a way as to protect one or more operators already present on the market, by concluding with them an agreement granting them fee rates guaranteed for the entire duration of that agreement, while having the intention at that time of subsequently exercising its regulatory power, by increasing the fee rate so that other market operators are placed at a disadvantage, be they operators already present on the market on the date on which that agreement was concluded or new operators.", "94", "It was in the light of those considerations that the General Court, in paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal, decided that it was necessary to examine whether, in those proceedings, the Commission was entitled to consider that the contested measure was selective.", "95", "It follows from the foregoing that, as MOL contends, paragraphs 64 to 67 of the judgment under appeal do not, as such, concern the examination of the selectivity of the 2005 agreement, but are preliminary explanations aimed at introducing the relevant framework in relation to which the General Court examined whether the Commission was correct in finding that the measure at issue was selective.", "96", "As the Advocate General stated in points 107 and 114 of his Opinion, by those preliminary explanations, the General Court in fact sought to deal with the issue of the links existing between the 2005 agreement and the 2008 amendment, which the Commission had not specifically addressed in the decision at issue, and more particularly, to underline the fact that, given that there is no chronological and/or functional link between those two elements, they cannot be interpreted as constituting a single aid measure.", "97", "By those preliminary explanations, the General Court merely applied the case-law laid down by the Court of Justice in the judgment in Bouygues and Bouygues Télécom v Commission and Others and Commission v France and Others (C‑399/10 P and C‑401/10 P, EU:C:2013:175), to which the General Court also expressly referred in paragraph 67 of the judgment under appeal, and according to which, since State interventions take various forms and have to be assessed in relation to their effects, it cannot be excluded that several consecutive measures of State intervention must, for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU, be regarded as a single intervention.", "That could be the case, in particular when consecutive interventions, having regard to their chronology, their purpose and the circumstances of the undertaking at the time of those interventions, are so closely related to each other that they are inseparable from one another.", "98", "In a similar vein, in paragraph 82 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found, first, that the increase in mining fees, which entered into force in 2008, occurred in a context of an increase of international prices, and secondly, the Commission had not argued that the 2005 agreement had been concluded in anticipation of such an increase, and it therefore concluded that the combination of that agreement and the 2008 amendment could not be categorised as State aid for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU.", "99", "It follows that the General Court’s reasoning in paragraphs 64 to 67 and 82 of the judgment under appeal is not vitiated by any error of law.", "100", "In addition, it must be stated that the Commission’s assertion that what is relevant is that, after 8 January 2008, MOL was the only undertaking to enjoy preferential treatment cannot be accepted.", "It is common ground in the present case, as is clear from paragraph 46 of the judgment under appeal, that the question whether the measure at issue is selective in nature was discussed by the parties solely in respect of the 2005 agreement, and not the 2008 amendment.", "101", "In the light of all of the foregoing, the third and fourth parts of the single ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "102", "Since none of the arguments raised by the Commission in support of its single ground of appeal has been upheld, the appeal must be rejected in its entirety.", "Costs", "103", "Under Article 138(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, which applies to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "Since MOL sought an order as to costs against the Commission and the latter has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to pay the costs of these proceedings.", "On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:", "1.", "Dismisses the appeal;", "2.", "Orders the European Commission to pay the costs."], "doc_id": "R2015_European Commission v MOL Magyar Olaj- és Gázipari Nyrt"}

point;", "– maintaining the fifth and sixth grounds of appeal alleging, respectively, misuse of powers and failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on that point;", "– withdrawing its other grounds of appeal.", "The appeals", "31 After hearing the parties and the Advocate General on this point, the Court considers that it is appropriate, on account of the connection between them, to join the present cases for the purposes of the judgment, in accordance with Article 43 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice.", "The ground of appeal which Demesa bases on the principle of protection of legitimate expectations", "Arguments of the parties", "32 Before the Court of First Instance, Demesa invoked the principle of protection of legitimate expectations.", "It referred to Commission Decision 93/337/EEC of 10 May 1993 concerning a scheme of tax concessions for investment in the Basque country (OJ 1993 L 134, p. 25).", "It claimed that that decision had categorised as State aid incompatible with the common market, on the ground that they were contrary to Article 52 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 43 EC), certain tax credits for investments made.", "Demesa maintained that the provisions necessary for adjusting the regional legislation to Decision 93/337 had been laid down and that the Commission had expressed its approval of the solution adopted.", "Accordingly, both the Spanish authorities and the Commission itself considered that the problem was solved.", "For that reason, the Commission never initiated a procedure in respect of State aid or raised any objection against similar tax measures adopted subsequently.", "It therefore led Demesa, and any trader subject to the regional legislation concerned, to entertain legitimate expectations that the tax measures adopted by the Diputación Foral de Álava were authorised by the Commission provided that they did not involve any infringement of Article 52 of the Treaty.", "33 Demesa complains that the Court of First Instance, at paragraph 234 et seq. of the judgment under appeal, rejected its plea on the ground that the impugned tax measure had not been the subject of prior notification, contrary to the requirements of Article 93(3) of the EC Treaty (now Article 88(3) EC).", "34 In its submission, in the context of the policy followed by the Commission at the time of its application for the tax credit of 45%, it was excessive to require a trader to ascertain whether the tax measure applicable to it satisfied the conditions of Article 92 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 87 EC) and should, in consequence, be notified to the Commission.", "35 Demesa was therefore correct to invoke the principle of protection of legitimate expectations.", "36 The appellant maintains that the declaration of incompatibility in Decision 93/337 was based on a finding of an infringement of Article 52 of the Treaty and not also, as the Court of First Instance held at paragraph 237 of the judgment under appeal, on the finding of an infringement of the Community rules on State aid.", "37 In any event, in Demesa’s submission, the measures called in question in Decision 93/337 were characterised as State aid on the basis of three criteria of selectivity (regional, sectoral and material selectivity) which, it contends, could not be upheld in relation to the impugned tax measure.", "Accordingly, that decision cannot be relied on to support the argument that Demesa should have considered that the tax credit of 45% constituted State aid and should, in consequence, have been notified to the Commission.", "38 The Commission claims that when the tax credit was granted to Demesa, certain elements clearly showed that it entailed State aid.", "39 In particular, Decision 93/337 considered that comparable measures constituted aid incompatible with the common market.", "That declaration of incompatibility was not linked solely to breach of the principle of freedom of establishment but, as the Court of First Instance observed at paragraph 237 of the judgment under appeal, also to breach of the various rules relating to aid.", "40 It is clear, moreover, that Decision 93/337 could only be based on a prior finding that the measures in question were in the nature of State aid.", "41 However, Demesa did not ascertain whether the aid it received had been authorised by the Commission.", "42 In any event, in the absence of prior notification of the impugned tax measure, the appellant could not plead that the Commission had failed to act.", "43 Accordingly, the Court of First Instance was correct to find that there had been no legitimate expectation.", "Findings of the Court", "44 It should be borne in mind, first, that in view of the mandatory nature of the review of State aid by the Commission under Article 93 of the Treaty, undertakings to which aid has been granted may not, in principle, entertain a legitimate expectation that the aid is lawful unless it has been granted in compliance with the procedure laid down in that article and, second, that a diligent businessman should normally be able to determine whether that procedure has been followed (Case C-5/89 Commission v Germany [1990] ECR I-3437, paragraph 14; Case C-169/95 Spain v Commission [1997] ECR I-135, paragraph 51; and Case C-24/95 Alcan Deutschland [1997] ECR I-1591, paragraph 25).", "45 In particular, where aid is paid without prior notification to the Commission, so that it is unlawful under Article 93(3) of the Treaty, the recipient of the aid cannot have at that time a legitimate expectation that its grant is lawful (see Alcan Deutschland, cited above, paragraphs 30 and 31).", "46", "In the present case, the Court of First Instance stated at paragraph 235 of the judgment under appeal that it was not disputed that the tax credit of 45% had been introduced without prior notification, in infringement of Article 93(3) of the Treaty.", "47 At paragraph 236 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance correctly held, referring inter alia to Commission v Germany, cited above, that the argument based on the principle of the protection of legitimate interests could not be upheld.", "48 At the following paragraph of that judgment, the Court of First Instance correctly stated that the applicant’s argument was based on a misreading of Decision 93/337.", "In that decision, as the Court of First Instance emphasised, the Commission had characterised the aid in question as incompatible with the common market not only because it was contrary to Article 52 of the Treaty but also, at Part V of that decision, in which the Commission examines the possibility of applying one of the derogations provided for in Article 92 of the Treaty, because it did not comply with the various rules relating to aid.", "49", "More specifically, in Decision 93/337 the Commission:", "– had stated that the aid in question included a tax credit of 20% in respect of investments (Part I);", "– had considered that, for the purpose of applying the derogation provided for in Article 92(3)(c) of the Treaty, the conditions laid down in the Community guidelines of 19 August 1992 on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises (OJ 1992 C 213, p. 2), which, after defining in point 2.2 the components of the category of small and medium-sized enterprises, stated, at point 4.1, fifth paragraph, that the Commission had decided to allow investment aid only up to the levels of 15% of the investment for small enterprises and 7.5% of the investment for other enterprises in the same category, were not satisfied (Part V);", "– had ordered the Spanish authorities to ensure that the aid was granted, inter alia, in accordance with the conditions laid down in the Community guidelines on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises (Article 1(4)).", "50 It is thus apparent that Demesa could not infer from Decision 93/337 that a tax credit of 45% granted to an undertaking of a size allowing it to make a minimum investment of ESP 2 500 million required by the Sixth Additional Provision of Norma Foral 22/1994 could not be categorised as aid for the purposes of Article 92 of the Treaty.", "51 >In the light of the terms of Decision 93/337, the appellant cannot therefore claim the possibility, which cannot be excluded (see Commission v Germany, cited above, paragraph 16), for the recipient of unlawful aid to rely on exceptional circumstances on the basis of which it legitimately assumed the aid to be lawful.", "52 As regards the Commission’s alleged failure to act, the Commission rightly claims that any apparent failure to act is irrelevant when an aid scheme has not been notified to it.", "53 It follows that the ground of appeal which Demesa bases on the principle of protection of legitimate expectations must be rejected.", "The grounds of appeal whereby the Territorio Histórico de Álava alleges, first, incorrect categorisation of the impugned tax measure as State aid incompatible with the common market and, second, failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on that point", "Arguments of the parties", "54 Before the Court of First Instance, the Territorio Histórico de Álava maintained that the Commission had infringed Article 92 of the Treaty by considering the tax credit of 45% to be State aid incompatible with the common market, on the ground that Norma Foral 22/1994 constituted a specific measure favouring ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’.", "It claimed that, in any event, any selective nature which that measure might have was justified by the nature and scheme of the tax system.", "55 The Territorio Histórico de Álava complains that the Court of First Instance, at paragraphs 148 to 170 of the judgment under appeal, rejected that argument and thus erred in law in applying Article 92 of the Treaty.", "56 In the pleading which it lodged on 20 February 2004, it states that it maintains its ground of annulment, but at an earlier stage than that of the categorisation of the impugned tax measure as State aid.", "It claims that during the proceedings at first instance it maintained that the tax credit of 45% was outside the scope of Article 92 of the Treaty, in so far as, as a tax measure, it was justified as a means of attaining an economic-policy objective.", "The Court of First Instance considered that that did not preclude its categorisation as State aid incompatible with the Treaty.", "That conclusion is incorrect, because it was formulated at an inappropriate point in the interpretation process.", "In reality, the Court of First Instance should, before addressing any question of categorisation as State aid, have considered that a tax measure adopted before the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning taxation policy (OJ 1998 C 2, p. 1) and the Commission notice of 10 December 1998 on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation (OJ 1998 C 384, p. 3) was excluded from the review of State aid.", "Where such a measure formed part of the industrial policy implemented by the Member State concerned, it was excluded from the outset from the scope of Article 92 of the Treaty.", "57 In the same pleadings, the Territorio Histórico de Álava further states that it also maintains its ground of appeal alleging failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal as regards the point of law raised.", "58 The Commission contends that, in its present form, the ground of appeal alleging incorrect categorisation of the impugned tax measure as State aid incompatible with the common market, notwithstanding the amended form in which it is presented, still requires an examination by the Court of the question of the nature as aid of that measure.", "The analysis carried out pursuant to Article 92 of the Treaty contains no stage preceding that of discussion of whether the measure in question must be categorised as State aid; the fiscal nature of a measure is of no relevance to the determination of whether or not it constitutes aid.", "Nor could the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning taxation policy and the code of conduct annexed thereto alter the allocation of powers established in the Treaty.", "In those circumstances, by disputing the competence of the Commission, the Territorio Histórico de Álava is persisting in challenging the categorisation as State aid of the impugned tax measure.", "Findings of the Court", "59 It must be borne in mind that to allow a party to put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it has not raised before the Court of First Instance would be to allow it to bring before the Court, whose jurisdiction in appeals is limited, a case of wider ambit than that which came before the Court of First Instance.", "In an appeal the Court’s jurisdiction is thus confined to review of the findings of law on the pleas argued before the Court of First Instance (see, in particular, Case C-136/92 P Commission v Brazzelli Lualdi and Others [1994] ECR I-1981, paragraph 59; Case C-7/95 P Deere v Commission [1998] ECR I‑3111, paragraph 62; and Case C-217/01 P Hendrickx v Cedefop [2003] ECR I‑3701, paragraph 37).", "60", "In the present case, the Territorio Histórico de Álava did not contend at first instance that:", "– the impugned tax measure is excluded as such from the scope of the law on State aid;", "– Article 92 of the Treaty has applied to the provisions of tax law only since the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning tax policy and the Commission notice of 10 December 1998 on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation.", "61 In reality, it referred to the economic-policy objectives of the impugned tax measure in the course of argument as to whether that measure was justified by the nature and scheme of the tax system, that is to say, at the stage of the argument concerning the categorisation of the measure as State aid incompatible with the common market for the purposes of Article 92 of the Treaty.", "62 The Court of First Instance examined the corresponding arguments at paragraphs 167 and 168 of the judgment under appeal.", "63 The argument submitted to the Court in the present appeal, namely that, in substance, the impugned tax measure was excluded from the outset, at a stage preceding the legal reasoning, from the scope of Article 92 of the Treaty and, subsequently, from actual review by the Commission, therefore constitutes a plea raised for the first time in the appeal.", "64 This new plea must be declared inadmissible, as must the ground of appeal alleging failure to state the grounds in the judgment under appeal on the point of law raised, as the latter cannot be dissociated from the former.", "The grounds of appeal whereby the Territorio Histórico de Álava alleges, first, an error of law on the part of the Court of First Instance in so far as it did not find that there had been a misuse of power and, second, failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on that point", "Arguments of the parties", "65 The Territorio Histórico de Álava states that it claimed before the Court of First Instance that the Commission had used the State aid procedure, an area in which it has exclusive competence and wide powers, in order to implement tax harmonisation.", "Such harmonisation belongs in reality to the procedure provided for in Articles 101 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 96 EC) and 102 of the EC Treaty (now Article 97 EC), which confers competence on the Council of the European Union.", "66", "The Territorio Histórico de Álava criticises the Court of First Instance for having confined itself:", "– to referring, at paragraph 84 of the judgment in Joined Cases T-92/00 and T‑103/00 Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission [2002] ECR II-1385), relating to aid granted to another undertaking, to the case-law according to which a decision may amount to a misuse of powers only if it appears, on the basis of objective, relevant and consistent evidence, to have been taken with the sole, or at least the decisive, aim of achieving purposes other than those stated;", "– to declaring that the existence of a de facto harmonisation brought about by the contested decision had not been demonstrated.", "67 The Commission contends that the ground of appeal is manifestly inadmissible, as it was not raised before the Court of First Instance.", "68 It states that in the judgment under appeal the Court of First Instance did not adjudicate on the question of a possible misuse of power.", "The Court of First Instance examined that question in a different judgment, namely the judgment in Joined Cases T-92/00 and T-103/00 Diputación Foral de Álava and Others v Commission, which was delivered on the same day as the judgment under appeal.", "Findings of the Court", "69 The Territorio Histórico de Álava did not raise a plea alleging misuse of powers before the Court of First Instance in the proceedings at first instance which gave rise to the present appeal.", "70 For the reasons stated at paragraph 59 of this judgment, this ground of appeal must be declared inadmissible, as a new plea, as must the ground of appeal alleging failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on that point, as the latter cannot be dissociated from the former.", "71 It follows from all of the foregoing that the appeals must be dismissed.", "Costs", "72 Under the first paragraph of Article 122 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs.", "73 Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, applicable to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 118 of those Rules, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "Since the appellants have been unsuccessful, they must be ordered, in addition to bearing their own costs, to pay those incurred by the Commission, in accordance with the form of order sought to that effect by the Commission.", "74 Under the third subparagraph of Article 69(4) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, also applicable to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 118, the Comunidad Autónoma del País Vasco, which has intervened in support of the form of order sought by the Territorio Histórico de Álava in Case C-187/02 P, must be ordered to bear its own

the Advocate General at the sitting on 13 May 1997 ,", "gives the following", "Judgment", "Grounds", "1 By application lodged at the Court Registry on 17 November 1995, Tiercé Ladbroke SA (`Ladbroke') brought an appeal under Article 49 of the EC Statute of the Court of Justice against the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 18 September 1995 in Case T-471/93 Ladbroke v Commission ([1995] ECR II-2537, `the contested judgment') dismissing Ladbroke's action for the annulment of the decision of the Commission contained in its letter of 18 January 1993 rejecting a complaint (IV/34.013) lodged by Ladbroke under Articles 92 and 93 of the EEC Treaty (`the contested decision').", "2 It appears from the contested judgment that, on 18 March 1991, the French Pari Mutuel Urbain (`the PMU'), an economic interest grouping set up by the main sociétés de courses (racecourse undertakings) in France with exclusive rights to organize off-course betting in France and to take bets abroad on races run in France or bets in France on horse-races run abroad, together with the Pari Mutuel Unifié Belge, a non-profit-making association, and the SC Auxiliaire PMU Belge, a cooperative company associated with it (hereinafter together referred to as `the Belgian PMU'), which were set up by the 11 Belgian racecourse operators, entered into an agreement under which the PMU was authorized to take, on the Belgian PMU's behalf, bets in France on Belgian horse-races (`the contested agreement') (paragraphs 1 to 3 of the contested judgment).", "3", "The contested agreement was made against the background of the French legislation, in particular Finance Law No 64-1279 of 23 December 1964 for 1965 (`Law No 64-1279'), Article 15(3) of which provides that the sociétés de courses authorized to organize off-course totalizator betting may be empowered to collect bets placed in France on foreign races provided that the bets taken are centralized and incorporated in the pool to be distributed in direct liaison with the body or bodies responsible for operating totalizator betting in the country concerned.", "That article further provides that the bets thus collected are to be subject to the statutory and fiscal levies in force in the country where the race is organized and that the proceeds of those levies are to be apportioned between the country where the bets are collected and the country where the race takes place.", "Such apportionment may include a special portion to cover administrative costs (paragraph 4 of the contested judgment).", "4 In addition, Decree No 91-118 of 31 January 1991, on the collection of bets by the PMU on horse-races organized in Belgium (`Decree No 91-118'), provides that on the first FF 50 million of stakes collected annually on races organized in Belgium the PMU is to pay each month the stamp duty proceeds to the general budget and 0.876% of the total stakes to the Fonds National des Haras et des Activités Hippiques (National Fund for Stud-farms and Equestrian Activities).", "On the tranche between FF 50 million and FF 75 million of stakes collected annually, the payments referred to above and one third of the proceeds of the progressive additional levy on winnings (hereinafter `the PAL') are to be paid to the general budget and 0.181% of the total stakes to the Fonds National des Haras et des Activités Hippiques.", "On the tranche between FF 75 million and FF 100 million of stakes collected annually, the first-mentioned payments and two-thirds of the proceeds of the PAL are to be paid to the general budget and 0.362% of the total stakes to the Fonds National des Haras et des Activités Hippiques.", "Finally, on amounts over FF 100 million collected annually, those payments and the total proceeds of the PAL are to be paid to the general budget and 0.543% of the total stakes to the Fonds National des Haras et des Activités Hippiques (paragraph 5 of the contested judgment).", "5 In France, the aggregate rates of the various statutory and fiscal levies which may be imposed on amounts staked on horse-races may not exceed 30%, whereas in Belgium, such levies may amount to a maximum of 35% according to Article 44(2)(d) of the Royal Decree of 8 July 1970 laying down general rules for charges treated as taxes on income (paragraphs 6 and 7 of the contested judgment).", "6 Against that legislative background, the contested agreement provides that the levy on the proceeds of bets taken in France on Belgian horse-races, at the rate of 35% as a result of the combined provisions of the abovementioned French and Belgian legislation, was to be apportioned according to a system which takes account of turnover.", "For that purpose, the agreement provides for four tranches.", "The first tranche comprises turnover under FF 50 million, in respect of which the French public beneficiaries receive 6.386% of the levy and the Belgian party 23.114%.", "The second tranche comprises turnover between FF 50 and 75 million, in respect of which the French share rises to 10.817% and the Belgian share falls to 16.183%.", "The third tranche comprises turnover between FF 75 and 100 million, in respect of which the French share reaches 15.238% and the Belgian share 9.762%.", "Finally, for turnover above FF 100 million the Belgian share falls to 5.602% and that of the French authorities rises to 19.169% (paragraph 8 of the contested judgment).", "7 On 12 July 1991, Ladbroke, which carries on business as a bookmaker, taking bets at fixed odds in Belgium on horse-races run abroad, lodged a complaint with the Commission against the PMU, the Belgian PMU and the French Republic pursuant, in particular, to Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.", "In that complaint Ladbroke requested the Commission to find that the contested agreement entailed the provision by France of unlawful and unnotified State aid to the Belgian PMU (paragraph 9 of the contested judgment).", "8 Ladbroke stated in its complaint that bets taken in France under the contested agreement are collected and administered in the same way as bets on French races, being part of the French system and centralized in the PMU's totalizator system using the PMU's resources and technology.", "Subsequently transferred from the French to the Belgian totalizator system, the total staked in bets on Belgian races taken in France is subject to a 35% levy in line with the Belgian legislation.", "Of that 35% levy, an amount equivalent to 26% goes to the Belgian PMU and the remaining 9% is returned to the French system, with approximately 4% going to the French State and 5% to the French sociétés de courses.", "In contrast, as regards amounts staked in bets on French races taken in France, the levy of approximately 30% is allocated as to 18% to the French State and as to 10% to the sociétés de courses (paragraph 10 of the contested judgment).", "9 Ladbroke accordingly claimed that the fact that the French Republic, the PMU and the French sociétés de courses retain only 9% of the levy on amounts staked on Belgian races and not 28%, as is the case for the levy on amounts staked on French races, is a form of fiscal treatment which, since it involves a charge on the French Republic and a profit for its recipient, the Belgian PMU, constitutes unlawful State aid for the Belgian PMU (paragraph 11 of the contested judgment).", "10 By the contested decision the Commission rejected Ladbroke's complaint concerning the alleged grant of unlawful State aid, on the following grounds:", "- the levy on the proceeds of betting on Belgian races cannot be termed a tax because it is itself subject to public deductions of a fiscal nature and in France, as in Belgium, it varies in accordance with a number of factors (paragraph 14 of the contested judgment);", "- after deduction of the `exclusively French' contributions, which come to some 5%, the French public retention of 18%, which applies to the 30% levy on bets on French races, falls to less than 13% and approaches the French public retention of 6.4% currently imposed on the 35% levy applied to the proceeds of bets taken in France on Belgian races (paragraph 15 of the contested judgment);", "- the share of the levy which accrues to the Belgian PMU is almost identical whether the bet is collected in France or in Belgium (paragraph 16 of the contested judgment);", "- the contested agreement considered as a whole appears to be advantageous to the Belgian PMU only during its initial phase, because of the decrease in its share of the levy on higher tranches of turnover (paragraph 17 of the contested judgment).", "11 However, in order to take account of any new facts that might emerge and of the possibility that in the years ahead the agreement might not be implemented beyond its initial phase, the Commission reserved the right to review the agreement after a period of four years and requested the French authorities to submit an annual report on how the terms of the agreement were being implemented in practice (paragraph 18 of the contested judgment).", "12 In paragraphs 58 to 63 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action against the contested decision, holding, essentially, that in concluding that there was no advantage constituting State aid in favour of the Belgian PMU, the Commission was entitled to base itself on a comparison between the rates of revenue realized by the Belgian PMU in France and in Belgium .", "13 The Court of First Instance nevertheless considered, in paragraph 68, that the reasoning of the contested decision was not such as to dispel all doubt which Ladbroke might have had as to the justification for the Commission's refusal to accept that the Belgian PMU gained a financial advantage and for the rejection of its complaint, so that the Commission was to be regarded as having contributed in part to the bringing of the action at first instance.", "Consequently, the parties, including the French Republic which intervened, were ordered to bear their own costs.", "14 At the hearing, the French Government informed the Court that the contested agreement had ceased to be implemented on 1 October 1996, principally because insufficient bets were being placed.", "15 For a more detailed account of the facts which gave rise to the dispute, reference is made to paragraphs 1 to 18 of the contested judgment.", "16 In its appeal Ladbroke requests the Court to:", "(1) allow the appeal and set the contested judgment aside;", "(2) annul the contested decision, and", "(3) order the Commission to pay its costs in the proceedings before both the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice.", "17 The Commission contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal and order Ladbroke to pay the costs.", "18 The French Republic submits that the Court should dismiss the appeal.", "19 In support of its appeal Ladbroke claims that the Court of First Instance erred in law in failing to deal expressly with its submission as to why the contested agreement involved State aid within the meaning of Article 92 of the Treaty, having wrongly considered that the contested agreement granted no advantage to the Belgian PMU.", "20 The four limbs of that plea relate to the reasoning of the Court of First Instance contained, successively, in paragraphs 58, 59, 60 and 62 of the contested judgment.", "21 Ladbroke criticizes, first, the reasoning in paragraph 58 of the contested judgment, in which the Court of First Instance considered, in substance, that the opening of the French market in horse-race betting, enabling the Belgian PMU to gain access, through the French PMU, to French punters, was a choice made by the French legislature which could not in itself be impugned as contrary to Article 92(1) of the Treaty solely because application of the contested agreement could have the effect of increasing the revenue of the Belgian PMU.", "22 While accepting that, where a Member State allows an undertaking from another Member State to have access to its domestic market, that does not of itself involve State aid, Ladbroke considers that it is a different matter if revenue received by that undertaking from the opening of the market comes either directly from that Member State or as a result of a State-directed transfer of funds.", "In such cases, there must be a presumption that that revenue constitutes aid granted by the State or through State resources within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the Treaty, unless it is shown to be normal payment for services rendered by the foreign undertaking to either the State or the transferor of the funds.", "23 According to Ladbroke, the Court of First Instance should therefore have analysed whether the French revenue obtained by the Belgian PMU came, as it maintained, from the State or State resources by way of a compulsory levy provided for under rules of French public law and by a transfer payment system ordered by the French Republic.", "If so, it should then have examined what part, if any, of that revenue could be said to be normal payment for services rendered by the Belgian PMU to the PMU.", "24", "Article 92 of the Treaty states: `Save as otherwise provided in this Treaty, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market.'", "25", "So, in order for there to be State aid within the meaning of that provision it is necessary, first, for there to be aid favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods and, second, for that advantage to come from the State or State resources.", "26", "It follows that if the reasoning in the contested decision to the effect that there was no advantage for the Belgian PMU was correct, the Court of First Instance was right to hold that that was enough in itself to justify the rejection of the complaint, and that it did not need to examine Ladbroke's argument that the Belgian PMU's French revenue came from a compulsory levy provided for under rules of French public law.", "27", "Consequently, it has to be considered whether the Court of First Instance was right to accept the reasoning in the contested decision to the effect that there was no treatment favouring the Belgian PMU.", "28", "Ladbroke challenges the reasoning in paragraphs 59 to 63 of the contested judgment, in which the Court of First Instance did not find fault with the finding in the contested decision that the Belgian PMU was not favoured because its revenue from bets taken in France under the contested agreement was obtained at a rate equivalent to that which it would have received if the bets on Belgian races were taken directly by it in Belgium.", "29", "The Court of First Instance stated, in particular, in paragraphs 60 and 62 of the contested judgment, that a comparison between the rate of revenue realized by the Belgian PMU in France and in Belgium on bets on Belgian races was the appropriate criterion for determining whether the Belgian PMU benefited from an advantage for the purposes of Article 92, since Article 15(3) of Law No 64-1279 established as a general rule that bets on horse-races run abroad were to be subject to the statutory and fiscal levies in force in the country in which the races were organized.", "According to the Court of First Instance, the way in which the levy on bets on Belgian races is treated in France, whereby the Belgian PMU receives a share of the levy comparable to that which it would receive if the Belgian statutory and fiscal retentions were applied, does not therefore constitute a measure which derogates from the scheme of the general system but on the contrary accords with that general system.", "30", "Ladbroke claims, however, that the comparison should have been between the levies on bets placed in France on non-French races and the levies on bets placed in France on French races.", "If a Member State claims to regulate a particular economic activity (by way of taxation or imposition of levies), it must treat all such economic activity equally.", "The general system for determining the statutory and fiscal retentions on betting in France should therefore, contrary to the finding of the Court of First Instance, be that established for bets placed in France and not that established by Article 15(3) of Law No 64-1279, of which, moreover, the Belgian PMU is the sole beneficiary.", "31", "It is true that a comparison between the revenue of the Belgian PMU in France and that which it would have received if the same bets had been taken in Belgium cannot be regarded per se as sufficient to justify the conclusion that there was no treatment favouring the Belgian PMU.", "32", "In paragraphs 61 to 63 of the contested judgment, however, the Court of First Instance examined Ladbroke's argument that the levy on Belgian races should be treated in the same way as the levy on bets on French races accruing to the PMU.", "33", "Ladbroke's argument disregards the specific nature of bets on Belgian races and what differentiates them from bets on French races.", "Since the two categories of bet are not identical, the existence of an advantage for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty cannot be deduced automatically from the difference of treatment to which they are subject.", "34", "In totalizator betting the stakes constitute a common pool which, after various levies, is distributed amongst the winners equally, whatever the origin of the bets.", "The share of the stakes paid out to the winners thus cannot vary according to the State in which the bets were placed.", "The proper functioning of such a system can therefore be ensured only if the rate at which any levies which may be imposed on the bets laid on a horse-race is that of the State in which the the race is run.", "35", "Furthermore, the system of statutory and fiscal retentions on bets on French horse-races was adopted in the light of the specific regulatory and economic conditions prevailing with regard to horse-racing and totalizator betting in France.", "There can be no requirement to transpose that system to totalizator betting on Belgian horse-races, which are organized under different regulatory and economic conditions.", "Moreover, since the levy rates in France and Belgium differ and the application of Belgian rates to bets placed in France is justified for reasons relating to the logic of the totalizator betting system referred to in paragraph 34 of this judgment, that levy cannot, in any event, be shared out between the various recipients on exactly the same basis in the two cases.", "36", "The French legislature therefore cannot be criticised for having treated bets on French races differently from bets on foreign races by providing, in Article 15(3) of Law No 64-1279, that bets on horse-races abroad were to be subject to the statutory and fiscal retentions in force in the country where the races are organized.", "37", "Accordingly the Court of First Instance was entitled to hold, in paragraph 63 of the contested judgment, that it was not possible to accept Ladbroke's argument that the way in which stakes on Belgian races were treated, which allegedly produced the advantage to the Belgian PMU complained of, should be the same as the way in which the levy accruing to the PMU was treated.", "38", "Furthermore, that conclusion is not affected by the fact that the general system governing bets on horse-races abroad has hitherto been applied only to bets on horse-races organized in Belgium.", "Article 15(3) of Law No 64-1279, which provides that the sociétés de courses authorized to organize off-course totalizator betting may be empowered to collect bets placed in France on foreign races, existed well before Decree No 91-118 was adopted and the contested agreement entered into, and both the latter follow the general system established by that provision.", "39", "In the light of the foregoing, the appeal must be dismissed.", "Decision on costs", "Costs", "40 Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party's pleadings.", "Since Ladbroke has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to

ex CP 9/07) implemented by Spain (OJ 2011 L 7, p. 48, ‘the decision at issue’).", "2        By its appeal in Case C‑64/19 P, the Kingdom of Spain claims that the same judgment should be set aside.", "I.", "Background to the dispute", "3        The background to the dispute, which was set out by the General Court in paragraphs 1 to 11 of the judgment under appeal, may be summarised as follows.", "4        On 10 October 2007, after a number of written questions had been sent to it in 2005 and 2006 by Members of the European Parliament and after a private operator had submitted a complaint to it in 2007, the European Commission decided to initiate the formal investigation procedure, under Article 108(2) TFEU; that procedure concerned the arrangement provided for in Article 12(5) of the Ley del Impuesto sobre Sociedades (‘the Corporate Tax Law’) as inserted by Ley 24/2001, de Medidas Fiscales, Administrativas y del Orden Social (Law No 24/2001 on fiscal, administrative and social measures), of 27 December 2001 (BOE No 313 of 31 December 2001, p. 50493), and reproduced in Real Decreto Legislativo 4/2004, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley del Impuesto sobre Sociedades (Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004 approving the recast text of the Corporate Tax Law), of 5 March 2004 (BOE No 61 of 11 March 2004, p. 10951, ‘the measure at issue’).", "5        The measure at issue provides that should an undertaking which is taxable in Spain acquire a shareholding in a ‘foreign company’, where that shareholding acquisition is at least 5% and the shareholding at issue is held without interruption for at least one year, the financial goodwill resulting from that shareholding may be deducted, in the form of an amortisation, from the basis of assessment for the corporate tax for which the undertaking is liable.", "The measure at issue specifies that, in order to be classified as a ‘foreign company’, a company must be subject to an identical tax to the tax applicable in Spain and its income must derive mainly from business activities carried out abroad.", "6        On 28 October 2009, the Commission adopted the decision at issue, by which it closed the formal investigation procedure, as regards shareholding acquisitions within the European Union.", "7        By that decision, the Commission declared that the measure at issue, which constitutes a tax advantage enabling Spanish companies to amortise the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of shareholdings in non-resident companies, was incompatible with the internal market where it applied to the acquisition of shareholdings in companies established within the European Union (Article 1(1) of the decision at issue) and ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid corresponding to the tax reductions granted on the basis of that scheme (Article 4 of that decision).", "8        However, the Commission kept the procedure open as regards shareholding acquisitions outside the European Union, with the Spanish authorities having given an undertaking that they would provide additional details concerning the obstacles to cross-border mergers outside the European Union which they had mentioned.", "9        On 12 January 2011, the Commission adopted Decision 2011/282/EU on the tax amortisation of financial goodwill for foreign shareholding acquisitions No C 45/07 (ex NN 51/07, ex CP 9/07) implemented by Spain (OJ 2011 L 135, p. 1), which also declared the measure at issue to be incompatible with the internal market where it applies to the acquisition of shareholdings in undertakings established outside the European Union.", "II.", "The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal", "10      By application lodged at the General Court Registry on 14 May 2010, WDFG brought an action for annulment of Article 1(1) and, in the alternative, of Article 4 of the decision at issue.", "11      By judgment of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939), the General Court upheld the action on the ground that the Commission had incorrectly applied the condition relating to selectivity laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU.", "The General Court also annulled Decision 2011/282 by its judgment of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938).", "12      By application lodged at the Registry of the Court of Justice on 19 January 2015, the Commission brought an appeal against the judgment of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939).", "That appeal, which was registered under number C‑20/15 P, was joined to the appeal registered under number C‑21/15 P, which the Commission had brought against the judgment of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938).", "13      WDFG, supported by the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain, contended that the appeal should be dismissed.", "14      By judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others (C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, ‘the judgment in WDFG’, EU:C:2016:981), the Court of Justice set aside the judgments of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939), and of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938), referred the cases back to the General Court, reserved the costs in part and ordered the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain to bear their own costs.", "15      By decision of the President of the Ninth Chamber, Extended Composition, of the General Court of 8 December 2017, after the parties had been heard, Case T‑219/10 RENV, World Duty Free Group v Commission, and Case T‑399/11 RENV, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission, were joined for the purposes of the oral part of the procedure, in accordance with Article 68 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court.", "16      By the judgment under appeal, the General Court dismissed the action brought by WDFG.", "17      In rejecting WDFG’s three pleas in law, alleging, first, that the measure at issue was not selective (paragraphs 32 to 228 of the judgment under appeal), secondly, that there had been an error in determining the beneficiary of the measure at issue (paragraphs 229 to 250 of the judgment under appeal) and, thirdly, that the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations had been infringed (paragraphs 251 to 327 of the judgment under appeal), the General Court held that the action had to be dismissed in its entirety, and that there was no need to rule on its admissibility, which had however been challenged by the Commission (paragraphs 30 and 329 of the judgment under appeal).", "18      As regards, more specifically, the first plea in law, the General Court pointed out, in the first place, that, as is apparent from the judgment in WDFG, a tax measure which grants an advantage upon satisfaction of the condition that an economic transaction is performed, may be selective including where, having regard to the characteristics of the transaction concerned, any undertaking may freely choose whether to perform that transaction (paragraphs 77 to 89 of the judgment under appeal).", "19      In the second place, the General Court examined the measure at issue in the light of the three stages of the method of analysing the selectivity of a national tax measure, set out in paragraphs 63 and 64 of the judgment under appeal, that is to say: first of all, the identification of the common or ‘normal’ tax regime applicable in the Member State concerned, next, the assessment of whether the tax measure at issue derogates from that common regime, in so far as it differentiates between operators which are, in the light of the objective pursued by the common regime, in a comparable factual and legal situation and, lastly, the assessment of whether such a derogation is justified by the nature and general scheme of that regime.", "20      As regards the first stage, the General Court stated that the reference framework defined in the decision at issue, namely the ‘tax treatment of goodwill’ (paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal), was the relevant reference system in the present case, in particular since undertakings which acquire shareholdings in non-resident companies are, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax treatment of goodwill, in a comparable legal and factual situation to that of undertakings which acquire shareholdings in resident companies.", "According to the General Court, the objective of that regime is to ensure a certain parallelism between the accounting treatment and tax treatment of the goodwill resulting for an undertaking from the acquisition of shareholdings in a company (paragraphs 116 to 122 of the judgment under appeal).", "The General Court thus rejected the idea that the measure at issue constitutes an autonomous reference system (paragraphs 126 to 140 of the judgment under appeal), with the result that it rejected the complaint alleging the existence of obstacles to cross-border combinations (paragraphs 121, 138 and 141 of the judgment under appeal).", "21      As regards the second stage, the General Court held that the Commission was fully entitled to find, in the decision at issue, that the measure at issue had introduced a derogation from the normal regime.", "It thus rejected the complaint that the Commission had failed to fulfil its obligation to demonstrate that the acquisition of shareholdings in resident companies and those in non-resident companies were comparable in the light of the objective of fiscal neutrality pursued by the measure at issue (paragraphs 142 to 164 of the judgment under appeal).", "22      As regards the third stage, the General Court pointed out that none of the arguments specifically advanced in the present case justified the derogation introduced by the measure at issue and thus the difference in treatment found (paragraphs 165 to 227 of the judgment under appeal).", "III.", "Forms of order sought and procedure before the Court of Justice", "23      By its appeal, WDFG (Case C‑51/19 P) claims that the Court should:", "–        set aside the judgment under appeal;", "–        uphold its action for annulment and annul the decision at issue definitively; and", "–        order the Commission to pay the costs.", "24      By its appeal, the Kingdom of Spain (Case C‑64/19 P) claims that the Court should:", "–        set aside the judgment under appeal;", "–        annul Article 1(1) of the decision at issue in so far as it classifies the measure at issue as State aid; and", "–        order the Commission to pay the costs.", "25      The Federal Republic of Germany claims that the Court should allow the appeals.", "26      The Commission contends that the Court should:", "–        dismiss the appeals, and", "–        order the appellants to pay the costs.", "27      By decisions of 22 March 2019 and 2 June 2020, Cases C‑51/19 P and C‑64/19 P were joined, respectively, for the purposes of the written procedure and for the purposes of the oral procedure and the judgment.", "IV.", "The appeals", "28      In support of their respective appeals, WDFG and the Kingdom of Spain rely on a single ground of appeal, alleging an infringement of Article 107(1) TFEU as regards the condition relating to selectivity.", "They complain, in essence, that the General Court made a number of errors of law in applying the three-stage method of analysing the selectivity of tax measures, as enshrined in the settled case-law of the Court of Justice.", "29      The Federal Republic of Germany concurs, in essence, with the appellants’ position, challenging the framework for analysing the selectivity of the measure at issue used in the present case.", "It submits, inter alia, that the General Court erred in law in holding that the fact that the measure at issue is a general measure available to any undertaking which fulfils its substantive conditions is no longer a relevant factor in the assessment of selectivity.", "30      As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, classification of a national measure as ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, requires all the following conditions to be fulfilled.", "First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources.", "Secondly, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between the Member States.", "Thirdly, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient.", "Fourthly, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (judgment in WDFG, paragraph 53 and the case-law cited, and judgment of 16 March 2021, Commission v Poland, C‑562/19 P, EU:C:2021:201, paragraph 27).", "31      It is well established that national measures that confer a tax advantage which, although not involving a transfer of State resources, place the recipients in a more favourable financial position than other taxpayers are capable of procuring a selective advantage for the recipients and, consequently, of constituting State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment in WDFG, paragraph 56, and judgment of 19 December 2018, A-Brauerei, C‑374/17, EU:C:2018:1024, paragraph 21).", "32      So far as concerns the condition relating to the selectivity of the advantage – inherent in the concept of a ‘State aid’ measure within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, and which alone is the subject of the arguments put forward in the present appeals – it follows from the settled case-law of the Court that that condition requires a determination as to whether, under a particular legal regime, the national measure at issue is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation and which accordingly suffer different treatment that can, in essence, be classified as discriminatory (judgment of 16 March 2021, Commission v Poland, C‑562/19 P, EU:C:2021:201, paragraph 28 and the case-law cited).", "33      The examination of whether such a measure is selective is thus, in essence, coextensive with the examination of whether it applies to a set of economic operators in a non-discriminatory manner (judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraph 53).", "34      Where the measure at issue is conceived as an aid scheme and not as individual aid, it is for the Commission to establish that that measure, although it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or certain sectors of activity (judgment in WDFG, paragraph 55 and the case-law cited).", "35      In order to classify a national tax measure as ‘selective’, the Commission must begin by identifying the reference system, that is the ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, and thereafter demonstrate that the tax measure at issue is a derogation from that reference system, in so far as it differentiates between operators who, in the light of the objective pursued by that system, are in a comparable factual and legal situation (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 December 2018, A-Brauerei, C‑374/17, EU:C:2018:1024, paragraph 36 and the case-law cited).", "36      The concept of ‘State aid’ does not, however, cover measures that differentiate between undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by the legal regime concerned, are in a comparable factual and legal situation, and are, therefore, a priori selective, where the Member State concerned is able to demonstrate that that differentiation is justified, in the sense that it flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which those measures form part (judgment of 19 December 2018, A-Brauerei, C‑374/17, EU:C:2018:1024, paragraph 44 and the case-law cited).", "37      The different parts of the single ground of appeal relied on respectively by the appellants must be examined in the light of those considerations.", "38      The single ground of appeal raised by WDFG is divided into six parts, which essentially concern: (i) the definition of the reference system; (ii) the determination of that system’s objective in the light of which the comparison must be carried out at the second stage of the analysis of selectivity; (iii) the allocation of the burden of proof; (iv) compliance with the principle of proportionality; (v) the existence of a causal link between the impossibility of merging abroad and the acquisition of shareholdings abroad; and (vi) the examination of the severability of the measure at issue according to the percentage of control.", "39      The single ground of appeal raised by the Kingdom of Spain for its part comprises four parts.", "Those parts concern: (i) the determination of the reference framework; (ii) the finding that the tax treatment of financial goodwill cannot constitute a general measure or an autonomous reference framework; (iii) the definition of the objective of that reference framework and the comparison of the situations required by the judgment in WDFG; and (iv) the allocation of the burden of proof in the present case as regards the constituent elements of that reference framework.", "40      Since the complaints formulated in the first to fourth parts of WDFG’s single ground of appeal and those advanced in support of the four parts of the Kingdom of Spain’s single ground of appeal coincide or overlap to a great extent, it is appropriate that they be examined together.", "A.", "The first part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal and the first and second parts of the Kingdom of Spain’s single ground of appeal, alleging errors in determining the reference system", "1.", "Arguments of the parties", "41      WDFG submits that the General Court made several errors in determining the reference system.", "42      First of all, WDFG argues that the General Court used a reference system different from that defined by the decision at issue, since the General Court described the reference system of that decision as being the ‘tax treatment of goodwill’ and did not limit that framework to the ‘tax treatment of financial goodwill only’ (paragraphs 92 and 140 of the judgment under appeal).", "In WDFG’s view, those two ‘expressions’ relate to substantively different approaches.", "WDFG submits that by substituting its own reasoning for that of the decision at issue and by having filled, by its own reasoning, a gap in the statement of reasons for the decision at issue, the General Court committed an error of law such as to require the judgment under appeal to be set aside.", "43      Next, WDFG submits that it was unjustified for the General Court, at the end of the analysis in paragraphs 126 to 140 of the judgment under appeal, to exclude the idea that the measure at issue could constitute an autonomous reference system.", "In that regard, not only did the General Court substitute its own reasoning for that of the decision at issue, inasmuch as that decision relied solely on the absence of obstacles to cross-border mergers, but the General Court also carried out a legally incorrect examination.", "Indeed, the General Court’s reasoning, inter alia, makes the definition of the reference framework dependent on the regulatory technique used.", "44      Lastly, and in any event, WDFG submits that the reference framework adopted by the General Court in the judgment under appeal was defined arbitrarily and results from a confusion between an exception and a general rule.", "In particular, there is no explanation as to why the General Court held that the objective pursued was none other than to ‘ensure a degree of consistency between the tax treatment of goodwill and its accounting treatment’ (paragraph 121 of the judgment under appeal).", "Nor did the General Court explain why it stated that the absence of a rule precluding the amortisation of financial goodwill where a national shareholding is acquired is nothing less than the ‘general rule’ of the broad reference system which it has defined (paragraph 135 of the judgment under appeal).", "Referring in particular to the approach adopted in the case giving rise to the judgment of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission (C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505), in which the Court of Justice held that the measure at issue in that case could not be regarded as constituting an exception to a general rule, WDFG submits that the reference framework was defined reductively in the present case, with the result that the judgment under appeal should be set aside.", "45      The Kingdom of Spain also submits that the General Court made errors of law in determining the reference system.", "46      In the first place, the Kingdom of Spain states that the determination of the reference system, which in its view constitutes the starting point of any analysis of selectivity, is a question of law subject to review by the Court of Justice.", "Referring more specifically to paragraphs 92 and 140 of the judgment under appeal, the Kingdom of Spain submits that the General Court relied on a different reference framework to that used in the decision at issue, covering a broader framework than that used by the Commission.", "47      In the second place, the Kingdom of Spain submits that the judgment under appeal is also vitiated by an error of law, in that the General Court found that the tax treatment of financial goodwill cannot constitute a general measure or an autonomous reference framework.", "From that point of view, that Member State expressly refers to paragraphs 95, 103, 104, 106, 122, 125 and 138 to 141 of the judgment under appeal, in which, in its view, the General Court rejected the argument based on the existence of obstacles to cross-border combinations by relying on grounds which, in addition to being unconvincing, are in no way apparent from the decision at issue.", "48      In that regard, the Kingdom of Spain submits that the determination of the reference framework used by the General Court is incorrect on four grounds.", "49      First, the judgment under appeal is based solely on the regulatory technique, which, as is clear from the case-law, is not an appropriate method for determining whether a measure is selective.", "The General Court was, therefore, wrong to hold that it is the need to ensure the proper coherence between the tax rule and the accounting rule which defines the objective of the measure (paragraphs 116, 118 and 121 of the judgment under appeal).", "50      Secondly, the General Court also erred in holding, on the basis of an erroneous analysis of the objective of the measure at issue developed in paragraphs 116 to 122 of the judgment under appeal, that the purpose of the tax legislation on financial goodwill at issue was to solve a ‘specific problem’.", "Contrary to the General Court’s conclusion, the tax legislation at issue in the present case is not intended to solve a specific problem, but to give full effect to the principle of fiscal neutrality, by ensuring that investment decisions are based on economic considerations, not tax criteria.", "In that regard, the General Court ought to have ascertained whether, in the decision at issue, the Commission had in a justified and coherent manner rejected the reference framework proposed by the Spanish authorities and the interested parties, having regard in particular both to the factual and legal obstacles to cross-border mergers.", "In the course of that examination, it ought also to have assessed whether, notwithstanding the guidance expressly set out by the Court of Justice in paragraph 123 of the judgment in WDFG and in its settled case-law, the Commission had acted contrary to the criteria set out in Article 107 TFEU by failing to compare the factual and legal situations in the light of the objective of the measure at issue.", "51      Thirdly, the Kingdom of Spain states that the measure at issue – which was intended to comply with the principle of fiscal neutrality, was open to all sectors and could be applied without there being any minimum investment obligation – bears no relation to the measure giving rise to the judgment of 2 July 1974, Italy v Commission (173/73, EU:C:1974:71), in which the condition of specificity underlying the selectivity criterion was specifically determined by several factors.", "52      Fourthly, the Kingdom of Spain submits that the result of the General Court’s approach would be to depart from the Court of Justice’s conclusions with regard to certain tax measures that were also intended to solve specific problems, but which were not regarded as constituting State aid.", "53      The Commission disputes the appellants’ arguments.", "It contends, principally, that the arguments advanced are, for the most part, inadmissible, since the action before the General Court did not include any complaint that there were errors affecting the determination of the reference system.", "Consequently, to allow the appellants to raise new arguments at the appeal stage would be to authorise them to bring before the Court of Justice a case of wider ambit than that which came before the General Court.", "In the alternative, the Commission contends that the appellants’ arguments are unfounded.", "Contrary to their submissions, first, the General Court referred to the same reference system as that identified in the decision at issue, secondly, the measure at issue cannot be regarded as an autonomous reference system and, thirdly, the judgment under appeal is reasoned to the requisite legal standard.", "2.", "Findings of the Court", "(a)    Admissibility", "54       As regards the admissibility of the arguments and evidence submitted in support of the parts of the single grounds of appeal under consideration – that admissibility being contested by the Commission on the ground that the arguments advanced in support of the appellants’ claims concerning the determination of the reference framework are new arguments – it should be borne in mind that, under Article 170(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, the subject matter of the proceedings before the General Court may not be changed in the appeal.", "55       Thus, according to settled case-law, the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice in an appeal is limited to review of the findings of law on the pleas and arguments debated before the General Court.", "A party cannot, therefore, put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it has not raised before the General Court since that would allow that party to bring before the Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction in appeal proceedings is limited, a wider case than that heard by the General Court (judgment of 29 July 2019, Bayerische Motoren Werke and Freistaat Sachsen v Commission, C‑654/17 P, EU:C:2019:634, paragraph 69 and the case-law cited).", "56      That said, an appellant is entitled to lodge an appeal relying, before the Court of Justice, on grounds and arguments which arise from the judgment under appeal itself and seek to criticise, in law, its correctness (judgments of 29 November 2007, Stadtwerke Schwäbisch Hall and Others v Commission, C‑176/06 P, not published, EU:C:2007:730, paragraph 17, and of 4 March 2021, Commission v Fútbol Club Barcelona, C‑362/19 P, EU:C:2021:169, paragraph 47).", "57      In the present case, it is apparent from paragraphs 92 to 141 of the judgment under appeal that the General Court examined whether the Commission had correctly identified the reference tax regime in the context of the first stage of the analysis of selectivity.", "In those circumstances, the appellants are entitled to challenge, on appeal, the grounds of the judgment under appeal relating to that first stage, notwithstanding the fact that they did not put forward at first instance arguments specifically aimed at challenging the decision at issue on that point.", "58      Furthermore, as the Advocate General observed in point 35 of his Opinion, it is clear that the appellants’ arguments include a detailed and specific criticism of the grounds of the judgment under appeal and seek, to a large extent, to challenge the observance by the General Court of the limits and the detailed rules governing the exercise of its review, and could not, in any event, have been raised before it.", "59     In the light of those considerations, the first part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal and the first and second parts of the Kingdom of Spain’s single ground of appeal are admissible.", "(b)    Substance", "60      The determination of the reference framework is of particular importance in the case of tax measures, since the existence of an economic advantage for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU may be established only when compared with ‘normal’ taxation.", "Thus, determination of the set of undertakings which are in a comparable factual and legal situation depends on the prior definition of the legal regime in the light of whose objective it is necessary, where applicable, to examine whether the factual and legal situation of the undertakings favoured by the measure in question is comparable with that of those which are not (judgments of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraphs 55 and 60, and of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission, C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505, paragraphs 88 and 89).", "61      For the purposes of assessing the selective nature of a tax measure of general application, it is, therefore, necessary that the common tax regime or the reference system applicable in the Member State concerned be correctly identified in the Commission decision and examined by the court hearing a dispute concerning that identification.", "Since the determination of the reference system constitutes the starting point for the comparative examination to be carried out in the context of the assessment of the selectivity of an aid scheme, an error made in that determination necessarily vitiates the whole of the analysis of the condition relating to selectivity (see, to that effect, judgments of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission, C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505, paragraph 107, and of 16 March 2021, Commission v Poland, C‑562/19 P, EU:C:2021:201, paragraph 46).", "62      In that context, it must be stated, as a preliminary point, that the determination of the reference framework, which must be carried out following an exchange of arguments with the Member State concerned, must follow from an objective examination of the content, the structure and the specific effects of the applicable rules under the national law of that State.", "In that regard, the selectivity of a tax measure cannot be assessed on the basis of a reference framework consisting of some provisions of the national law of the Member State concerned that have been artificially taken from a broader legislative framework (judgment of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission, C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505, paragraph 103).", "63      Consequently, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point 49 of his Opinion, where the tax measure in question is inseparable from the general tax system of the Member State concerned, reference must be made to that system.", "On the other hand, where it appears that such a measure is clearly severable from that general system, it cannot be ruled out that the reference framework to be taken into account may be more limited than that general system, or even that it may equate to the measure itself, where the latter appears as a rule having its own legal logic and it is not possible to identify a consistent body of rules external to that measure.", "64      Next, since outside the spheres in which EU tax law has been harmonised, it is the Member State concerned which defines, by exercising its exclusive competence in the matter of direct taxation, the characteristics constituting the tax, the determination of the reference system or the ‘normal’ tax regime, from which it is necessary to analyse the condition relating to selectivity, must take account of those characteristics (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 March 2021, Commission v Poland, C‑562/19 P, EU:C:2021:201, paragraphs 38 and 39).", "65      It must also be borne in mind that, in so far as the determination of the reference framework must be based on an objective examination of the content and structure of the applicable rules under national law, it is not necessary, during that first stage of the examination of selectivity, to take account of the objectives pursued by the legislature when adopting the measure under examination.", "In that regard, the Court has held on numerous occasions that the objective pursued by measures of State intervention is not sufficient to exclude those measures outright from classification as ‘aid’ for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU, since that provision does not distinguish between measures of State intervention by reference to their causes or their aims but defines them in relation to their effects (see, to that effect, judgments of 22 December 2008, British Aggregates v Commission, C‑487/06 P, EU:C:2008:757, paragraphs 84 and 85, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraph 48).", "66      Lastly, the rules which must make up the reference system should be identified according to objective criteria, in particular to enable judicial review of the assessments on which that identification is based.", "It is for the Commission to take into account any factors put forward by the Member State concerned and, more generally, to carry out its examination in a rigorous and sufficiently reasoned manner in order to enable full judicial review.", "67      It is in the light of those considerations that the Court must assess the merits of the appellants’ arguments relating to the determination of the reference system as the first stage and necessary premiss for the analysis of selectivity.", "As is apparent from paragraphs 41 to 52 above, the appellants submit, in essence, that the General Court erred in law, first, by substituting the grounds of the decision at issue as regards the definition of the reference system adopted, secondly, by excluding the measure at issue from being regarded on its own as an autonomous reference system and by substituting grounds in that regard and, thirdly, by defining that system in an arbitrary manner.", "68      It is appropriate to examine those three complaints in turn.", "(1)    The existence of an error of law in the determination of the reference system (first complaint in the first part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal and first part of the Kingdom of Spain’s single ground of appeal)", "69      WDFG, by the first complaint in the first part of its single ground of appeal, and the Kingdom of Spain, by the first part of its single ground of appeal, submit that the General Court erred in law in determining the reference system by substituting its own reference system for that used by the Commission in the decision at issue.", "While the Commission had designated the rules relating to the tax treatment of financial goodwill as constituting the reference system, the General Court, relying on a substantially different analysis, also included in that system the tax treatment of ‘non-financial’ goodwill.", "WDFG and the Kingdom of Spain refer in particular to paragraphs 92 and 140 of the judgment under appeal.", "70      In that regard, the Court of Justice points out that, in reviewing the legality of acts under Article 263 TFEU, the Court of Justice and the General Court have jurisdiction in actions brought on grounds of lack of competence, infringement of an essential procedural requirement, infringement of the Treaty or of any rule of law relating to its application, or misuse of powers.", "Article 264 TFEU provides that if the action is well founded, the act concerned must be declared void.", "The Court of Justice and the General Court cannot, therefore, under any circumstances, substitute their own reasoning for that of the author of the contested act (judgments of 27 January 2000, DIR International Film and Others v Commission, C‑164/98 P, EU:C:2000:48, paragraph 38, and of 4 June 2020, Hungary v Commission, C‑456/18 P, EU:C:2020:421, paragraph 70 and the case-law cited).", "71      Nonetheless, except where there is no material factor to justify that course of action, the General Court may be led, in proceedings for annulment, to interpret the reasoning of the contested measure in a manner which differs from that of its author, and even, in certain circumstances, to reject the latter’s formal statement of reasons (see, to that effect, judgments of 27 January 2000, DIR International Film and Others v Commission, C‑164/98 P, EU:C:2000:48, paragraph 42, and of 22 December 2008, British Aggregates v Commission, C‑487/06 P, EU:C:2008:757, paragraph 142).", "72      In the present case, as is apparent from paragraphs 70, 92, 123 and 140 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found that the Commission had used the tax treatment of ‘goodwill’ as the reference system, for the purposes of its assessment of the selectivity of the measure at issue.", "In particular, the General Court noted, in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission ‘[had] not limit[ed] that framework to the tax treatment of financial goodwill only’.", "As the appellants have rightly pointed out, the Commission had stated, in recital 96 of the decision at issue, that the appropriate framework for the assessment of the measure at issue was constituted by the rules on the tax treatment of ‘financial goodwill’.", "73      However, although the terminology used in the judgment under appeal does indeed differ from that of the decision at issue, it cannot be concluded that the General Court thereby identified a reference system that was substantively different from that identified by the Commission or that it relied on a different reasoning from that of the Commission in the decision at issue in order to find that the tax treatment of goodwill constituted the relevant reference system in the present case.", "74      As the Commission contends, in the circumstances of the present case, the treatment of goodwill may be fully assimilated to the treatment of financial goodwill.", "75      In that regard, as the General Court noted in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission expressly ruled out, in the decision at issue – in response inter alia to the arguments put forward by the Spanish authorities regarding the identification of the reference system – the limitation of that system to the tax treatment of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of a shareholding in a company established in a country other than Spain.", "The General Court thus emphasised that, as is clear from recital 89 of the decision at issue, the Commission had stated that the measure at issue had to be assessed in the light of the general provisions of the corporate tax system as applicable to situations in which the emergence of goodwill leads to a fiscal benefit.", "The Commission clarified, in that decision, that its position could be explained by the finding that the situations in which financial goodwill can be amortised do not cover the whole category of taxpayers placed in a similar factual or legal situation.", "76      In that context, it should be noted that, as is apparent from paragraph 71 of the judgment under appeal, for the purposes of identifying the reference system, the General Court relied, inter alia, on the Commission’s findings in recitals 19, 20, 99 and 100 of the decision at issue, according to which the reference system provided for the amortisation of goodwill only in the event of a business combination, with the result that, by allowing the goodwill that would have been booked, if the businesses had combined, to appear even in the absence of a business combination, the measure at issue constituted an exception to that reference system.", "77      In addition, referring also to recital 100 of the decision at issue, the General Court additionally relied on the Commission’s findings that, since the amortisation of goodwill deriving from the simple acquisition of shareholdings was allowed only in the case of cross-border shareholding acquisitions and not in the case of the acquisition of domestic shareholdings, the measure at issue thereby introduced a difference in treatment between domestic transactions and cross-border transactions, with the result that it could not be considered a new general rule in its own right.", "78      It is clear from those passages of the decision at issue, to which the judgment under appeal relates, that, as the General Court held, when the Commission designated the ‘rules on the tax treatment of financial goodwill’ as the reference system, it intended to refer not only to the rules specifically applicable to the amortisation of goodwill in the event of the acquisition of shareholdings, but also to the rules of the general Spanish corporate tax system governing the amortisation of goodwill in general, since those general rules do indeed provide a relevant assessment framework for those more specific rules.", "79      It follows that, in paragraphs 70, 92, 123 and 140 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court confined itself to interpreting the decision at issue as regards the definition of the reference system in a manner consistent with the particulars of that decision and did not, therefore, substitute the grounds of that decision within the meaning of the case-law referred to in paragraph 70 of the present judgment.", "Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in determining the reference system.", "80      The first complaint in the first part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal and the first part of the Kingdom of Spain’s single ground of appeal must, therefore, be rejected as unfounded.", "(2)    The refusal to consider the measure at issue as an autonomous reference system (second complaint in the first part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal and second part of the Kingdom of Spain’s single ground of appeal)", "(i)    The existence of a substitution of grounds", "81      The appellants complain that the General Court substituted its own reasoning for that of the decision at issue in ruling out the possibility that the measure at issue might constitute a reference system in its own right.", "In essence, although the Commission had in that decision dismissed the possibility of there being an autonomous reference system constituted by the measure at issue solely because of the alleged absence of legal obstacles to cross-border mergers, the General Court is argued to have relied on a different argument in paragraphs 127 to 140 of the judgment under appeal.", "82      In that regard, as has been pointed out in paragraph 75 above, it must be borne in mind that the General Court held that, from the Commission’s point of view, the reference system could not be limited to the tax treatment of financial goodwill, introduced by the measure at issue, since that measure benefited only undertakings acquiring shareholdings in non-resident companies, and that, in order to assess the existence of discrimination against undertakings making acquisitions of the same type but in resident companies, it was necessary to take account of the general provisions of the corporate tax system as applicable to situations in which the emergence of goodwill leads to a fiscal benefit.", "83      It cannot, therefore, be concluded that the General Court substituted the grounds of the decision at issue by overlooking the fact that the Commission allegedly relied, in reality, on the absence of obstacles to cross-border combinations in order to exclude the measure at issue from constituting the reference tax system.", "84      Although, as the appellants submit, the Commission did indeed refer, in recitals 93 to 96 and 117 of that decision, to the alleged absence of legal obstacles to cross-border mergers, it confined itself, by those references, to taking a position on the observations submitted by the Spanish authorities with a view, inter alia, to calling into question not only the reference system as provisionally identified in the decision of 10 October 2007 to initiate the formal investigation procedure, but also the possible elements of comparison and justification under the second and third stages of the examination of selectivity.", "85      Consequently, as the Advocate General observed in point 65 of his Opinion, contrary to the appellants’ contentions, it is not because of a lack of recognition of obstacles to cross-border business combinations that the Commission decided that the measure at issue could not be the correct reference system for the purposes of the selectivity analysis, but because it took the view that that measure should be assessed in the light of a broader set of rules, which included both the rules applicable to the amortisation of financial goodwill in the case of the acquisition of shareholdings in resident companies and the principles applicable to the amortisation of goodwill in general, which, according to the Commission, were aligned with each other in providing that goodwill was deductible only if the acquisition of a shareholding was followed by a business combination.", "86      It follows that the claim that the General Court substituted grounds, in paragraphs 127 to 140 of the judgment under appeal, is unfounded.", "(ii) The existence of an error of law in the General Court’s refusal to regard the measure at issue as an autonomous reference system", "87      The appellants submit, in the alternative, that the reasoning followed by the General Court in order to rule out the possibility that the measure at issue might constitute an autonomous reference system is vitiated by an error of law.", "First, they observe that the aim of that measure is to ensure fiscal neutrality with regard to acquisitions of shareholdings in Spain and abroad and, accordingly, its purpose cannot be reduced to that of solving a specific problem, as the General Court incorrectly stated in paragraph 139 of the judgment under appeal.", "Secondly, they argue that the General Court’s reasoning leads to the selectivity of a measure being assessed differently, depending on whether the national legislature decided to create a separate tax or to modify a general tax, and, therefore, depending on the regulatory technique used.", "88      In the present case, the Court of Justice notes that the reasoning set out by the General Court in paragraphs 95 to 141 of the judgment under appeal was intended to respond to the argument that, because of the obstacles to cross-border combinations, the Commission ought to have identified the measure at issue as the reference system.", "89      Although the appellants do not criticise the methodology applicable to the determination of the reference system in the context of the first stage of the examination of selectivity set out in paragraphs 95 to 108 of the judgment under appeal, they do, however, criticise the remainder of the examination carried out by the General Court, as set out in paragraphs 109 to 141 of that judgment.", "90      As regards, in the first place, the reasoning set out in paragraphs 109 to 125 of the judgment under appeal, that reasoning is concerned with the issue whether, in the light of the objective of the normal regime identified by the Commission, undertakings acquiring shareholdings in resident companies and those acquiring shareholdings in non-resident companies are in a comparable legal and factual situation.", "91      However, that examination of comparability is not directly connected to the delimitation of the reference framework which must be carried out under the first stage of the examination of selectivity, notwithstanding the fact that, in paragraph 125 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found ‘the existence of links between those two steps, or even in some cases, such as the present, a common line of reasoning’.", "Thus, the arguments advanced by the appellants in order to challenge the definition of the objective of the reference system will be assessed at a later stage, in the context of the examination of the second part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal and the third part of the Kingdom of Spain’s single ground of appeal, alleging an error in the determination of the objective in the light of which the examination of comparability had to be carried out.", "92      In the second place, as regards paragraphs 126 to 141 of the judgment under appeal, in those paragraphs the General Court examined whether the measure at issue could in itself, in the light of its own specific characteristics and therefore regardless of any comparative analysis, constitute an autonomous reference framework.", "93      In that regard, first, the appellants are wrong to argue that the General Court relied primarily on the regulatory technique chosen by the Spanish legislature, in order to conclude that the measure at issue was selective.", "It is indeed apparent from the judgment under appeal that the General Court relied on the purpose and effects of that measure and not on merely formal considerations.", "In particular, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 135 of that judgment, that the measure at issue constituted an exception to the general rule that only business combinations may lead to the amortisation of goodwill.", "94      Admittedly, as the appellants have rightly argued, it is apparent from the case-law that the use of a particular regulatory technique cannot enable national tax rules to evade, from the outset, scrutiny under State aid rules as provided for under the FEU Treaty, nor is such use sufficient to define the relevant reference framework for the purposes of assessing the condition relating to selectivity, since that would cause the form of State intervention to prevail decisively over its effects.", "Consequently, the regulatory technique used cannot be decisive for the purposes of determining the reference framework (see, to that effect, judgment in WDFG, paragraph 76, and judgment of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission, C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505, paragraph 92).", "95      However, it follows from that case-law that while for the purposes of establishing the selectivity of a tax measure the regulatory technique used is not decisive, with the result that it is not always necessary for it to derogate from a common tax system, the fact that it is a derogation as a result of the use of that regulatory technique is relevant for those purposes where it follows that two categories of operators are distinguished and a priori treated differently, namely those covered by the derogation and those which are covered by the ordinary taxation regime, even though those two categories are in a comparable situation with regard to the objective pursued by that system (judgment of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission, C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505, paragraph 93 and the case-law cited).", "96      It follows that the General Court cannot be criticised for having held, among other considerations, that the measure at issue constituted a derogation in order to examine whether it was selective.", "97      Secondly, as regards the appellants’ criticism of the reference to the Opinion of Advocate General Warner in Italy v Commission (173/73, ‘Advocate General Warner’s Opinion’, EU:C:1974:52, p. 728), the General Court rightly pointed out, in paragraph 135 of the judgment under appeal, that, as the Commission correctly stated in recital 100 of the decision at issue, the measure at issue had not introduced a new general rule in its own right relating to the amortisation of goodwill;  it had, on the contrary, introduced an ‘exception to the general rule’ that only business combinations may lead to the amortisation of goodwill, with that exception, in the Kingdom of Spain’s view, being intended to remedy the adverse effects for the acquisition of shareholdings in non-resident companies created by applying the general rule.", "98      Consequently, it is apparent from the judgment under appeal that, in support of its conclusion that the reference system could not be limited to the measure at issue alone, the General Court did not rely solely on the fact that that measure, like the measure at issue in the case which gave rise to Advocate General Warner’s Opinion, was intended to pursue a targeted objective and thus to solve a specific problem.", "It follows that the arguments advanced by the appellants, first, objecting to the present case’s being placed on the same footing as that which gave rise to Advocate General Warner’s Opinion and, secondly, intended to demonstrate that the objective of the measure at issue was to safeguard the principle of fiscal neutrality, and not to solve a specific problem, are insufficient to invalidate the General Court’s reasoning and are, therefore, ineffective.", "99      In any event, it must be borne in mind that the mere fact that the measure at issue is of a general nature, in that it may a priori benefit all undertakings subject to corporate tax, does not mean that it cannot be selective.", "As the Court of Justice has already held, with respect to a national measure conferring a tax advantage of general application, like the measure at issue, the condition relating to selectivity is fulfilled where the Commission is able to demonstrate that that measure is a derogation from the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, thereby introducing, through its actual effects, differences in the treatment of operators, although the operators who qualify for the tax advantage and those who do not are, in the light of the objective pursued by that Member State’s tax system, in a comparable factual and legal situation (judgment in WDFG, paragraph 67).", "100    In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the second complaint in the first part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal and the second part of the Kingdom of Spain’s single ground of appeal must be rejected as ineffective and, in any event, unfounded.", "(3)    The arbitrary nature of the definition of the reference system (third complaint in the first part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal)", "101    In the third complaint in the first part of its single ground of appeal, WDFG submits, first, that the reference system used by the General Court was defined arbitrarily, since it is difficult to identify the criterion specifically used to identify the coherent framework of which the measure at issue forms part.", "It submits, secondly, that the General Court erroneously and invalidly identified, in the reference system which it defined, what constitutes the rule and what constitutes the exception.", "According to WDFG, the General Court was wrong to hold, in paragraph 135 of the judgment under appeal, that the rule was that it was impossible to amortise goodwill and that the measure at issue introduced an exception to that rule.", "As in the case which gave rise to the judgment of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission (C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505), the General Court confused the rule with the exception.", "102    The first submission, alleging that the General Court arbitrarily defined the reference system at issue, must be rejected since, as is apparent from paragraphs 75 to 78 above, the General Court set out to the requisite legal standard the reasoning which led it to refer, in the circumstances of the present case, to the rules applicable under Spanish law to the tax treatment of goodwill for the purposes of determining corporate tax and, thus, to confirm the assessment in that regard in the decision at issue.", "It should be borne in mind that the premiss on which the Commission relied is based on the finding, endorsed by the General Court, that under Spanish law amortisation of goodwill is generally conditional on there being a business combination.", "103    The second submission, alleging that the General Court erroneously and invalidly identified the rule and the exception, must also be rejected.", "In accordance with the interpretation of the Spanish tax legislation adopted by the General Court, only a business combination generally allows the amortisation of goodwill, including in the case of financial goodwill resulting from the acquisition of shareholdings in resident companies, in accordance with Article 89(3) of the Corporate Tax Law, as approved by Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004.", "It is not, therefore, the non-amortisation of financial goodwill which constitutes the general rule from which the measure at issue derogates, but the principle that the amortisation is generally possible only in the case of a business combination; the General Court inferred that principle from the provisions on the tax treatment of goodwill for corporate tax purposes, whether those provisions relate to the amortisation of goodwill in the case of an acquisition of an undertaking or to the amortisation of financial goodwill resulting from the acquisition of shareholdings in resident companies followed by a merger.", "104    In the light of those considerations, the third complaint in the first part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal and, consequently, the first part of that ground of appeal in its entirety, must be rejected as unfounded.", "B.", "The second part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal and the third part of the Kingdom of Spain’s single ground of appeal, alleging an error in the determination of the objective in the light of which the examination of comparability is carried out", "1.", "Arguments of the parties", "105    WDFG and the Kingdom of Spain, in the context of the second and third parts of their single ground of appeal respectively, dispute, in essence, the grounds of the judgment under appeal, set out in paragraphs 143 to 164 thereof, by which the General Court identified the objective of the reference system and, in the light of that objective, compared the situation of the undertakings qualifying for the advantage established by the measure at issue and those which do not.", "106    WDFG submits, in the first place, that the General Court erred in law in determining the objective underlying the comparison to be carried out in the second stage of the examination of the selectivity of the measure at issue.", "The General Court, which again departed from the decision at issue, misinterpreted the case-law on the determination of the objective applicable to a tax measure.", "Contrary to what the General Court suggests, there is no contradiction in the case-law of the Court of Justice as to whether the situation of the undertakings qualifying for the ‘measure at issue’ and that of those not qualifying must be compared in the light of the objective of that measure or that of the ‘system of which it forms part’.", "According to WDFG, those objectives must coincide and, if they do not, it is because the national legislature introduced into the tax system a measure which is inconsistent with its logic.", "In the present case, the true objective of the regime by reference to which the comparison should be made is, as the Commission itself acknowledged in the decision at issue, fiscal neutrality.", "Fiscal neutrality is a much more general and logical objective than the parallelism, referred to by the General Court, between the accounting treatment and tax treatment of the goodwill from which an undertaking benefits as a result of acquiring shareholdings in a company, since as a matter of principle any corporate tax departs by definition from the accounting result.", "107    In the second place, WDFG submits that the General Court was wrong to hold, in paragraph 121 of the judgment under appeal, that the objective of the tax provisions on goodwill was to ensure a degree of consistency between the tax treatment of goodwill and its accounting treatment.", "That assertion is not only arbitrary, but wholly unfounded, since by definition all corporate taxes differ from the accounting result.", "As regards specifically the provisions on the amortisation of goodwill, the various situations provided for by the Corporate Tax Law, as approved by Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004, have in common not the objective of ensuring consistency between the tax treatment and accounting treatment of goodwill, but rather that of avoiding double taxation and of ensuring fiscal neutrality.", "108    The Kingdom of Spain also submits that the General Court erred in law in failing to define correctly the objective of the reference framework and in failing to carry out correctly the comparison required by the judgment in WDFG.", "It takes the view that not only does the definition of the reference framework adopted in the judgment under appeal differ from that of the decision at issue, but that the General Court was also wrong to hold that the objective of the measure at issue was to ensure consistency between the tax treatment of goodwill and its accounting treatment.", "The accounting rule and the tax rule differ in many respects as regards the recognition of goodwill and even its amortisation.", "Contrary to the General Court’s finding, the objective pursued by the measure at issue is fiscal neutrality, so that similar investment decisions may be based on economic criteria, not tax criteria.", "109    The Commission contends that those arguments, which it considers inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded, should be rejected.", "2.", "Findings of the Court", "(a)    Admissibility", "110    The Commission contends that the second part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal and the third part of the Kingdom of Spain’s single ground of appeal are inadmissible in their entirety.", "It maintains that the arguments put forward were not raised before the General Court or relate to questions of fact, which include the interpretation of the content and scope of national law.", "111    As regards the first plea of inadmissibility raised by the Commission, it must be rejected on the same grounds as those set out in paragraphs 56 to 58 above.", "A party is entitled to put forward pleas and arguments arising from the judgment under appeal itself and which seek to criticise, in law, its correctness.", "The appellants are, therefore, entitled to call into question the findings made by the General Court, irrespective of the fact that they did not put forward at first instance arguments intended specifically to challenge the decision at issue on that point.", "112    As regards the second plea of inadmissibility raised by the Commission, alleging that the appellants intended to call into question findings of fact which are not, in principle, subject to review by the Court of Justice, it must be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law, the assessment of facts and evidence does not constitute, save where the clear sense of the facts and evidence has been distorted, a question of law which is subject as such to review by the Court of Justice in the context of an appeal.", "It is only when the General Court has established or assessed the facts that the Court of Justice has jurisdiction under Article 256 TFEU to review the legal characterisation of those facts and the legal conclusions which have been drawn from them (judgment of 25 July 2018, Commission v Spain and Others, C‑128/16 P, EU:C:2018:591, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited).", "113    Thus, with respect to the assessment in the context of an appeal of the General Court’s findings on national law, which, in the field of State aid, constitute findings of fact, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction only to determine whether that law was distorted.", "By contrast, since the assessment in the context of an appeal of the legal classification which has been attributed to that national law by the General Court under a provision of EU law constitutes a question of law, it falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice (judgment of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission, C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505, paragraph 78 and the case-law cited).", "114    Furthermore, as has been pointed out in paragraph 70 above, the General Court cannot, under any circumstances, substitute its own reasoning for that of the author of the contested act, with the result that the Court of Justice has jurisdiction in an appeal to ascertain whether the General Court has made such a substitution and thus erred in law.", "115    Since by their arguments summarised in paragraphs 105 to 108 above the appellants essentially complain that the General Court substituted its own reasoning for that of the decision at issue, concerning the ‘objective’ in the light of which the situations of the undertakings qualifying for the advantage resulting from the application of the measure at issue and those not qualifying must be compared, those arguments are admissible.", "(b)    Substance", "116    In the first place, as regards the argument directed against the General Court’s conclusion that the case-law is inconsistent as to whether the comparison should be carried out in the light of the objective of the measure examined or that of the system of which that measure forms part, that argument must be rejected as ineffective.", "117    WDFG merely asserts that the choice between one or other objective is immaterial since they must, in principle, coincide.", "Consequently, even if the General Court’s findings in relation to the scope of the case-law of the Court of Justice were to be incorrect, it must be observed that WDFG does not challenge the General Court’s conclusion, set out in paragraph 156 of the judgment under appeal, that the examination of comparability at the second stage of the analysis of selectivity has to be carried out in the light of the objective of the reference system of which the measure under examination forms part, and not in the light of that measure’s objective.", "118    In the second place, the appellants raise a complaint alleging the substitution of the grounds of the decision at issue as regards the identification of the reference system’s objective.", "They submit that the objective of ensuring ‘a degree of consistency between the tax treatment of goodwill and its accounting treatment’, referred to in paragraph 121 of the judgment under appeal, is in no way reflected in either the decision at issue or the observations submitted by the Kingdom of Spain during the administrative procedure.", "WDFG also submits that, in any event, the assertion that the tax provisions on goodwill pursue such an objective is arbitrary and unfounded.", "119    In the present case, it must be noted that the Commission did not at any point of the decision at issue state that the objective of the reference system that it identified included maintaining a degree of consistency between the tax treatment and accounting treatment of goodwill.", "120    Admittedly, the General Court referred, in paragraphs 117 to 119 of the judgment under appeal, to some of the findings in that decision when it stated that the tax treatment of goodwill is based on the criterion of whether or not a business combination has arisen; it also explained, by reference to recitals 19 and 99 of the decision at issue, that that circumstance is due to the fact that, following an acquisition or contribution of the assets constituting independent businesses or even a merger or a de-merger, ‘goodwill … appears, as a separate intangible asset, in the books of the combined business’ (paragraph 117 of the judgment under appeal).", "Similarly, the statement that the tax treatment of goodwill is ‘in line with an accounting logic’ (paragraph 116 of the judgment under appeal) follows on from certain considerations set out by the Commission in the decision at issue, in particular in recitals 97 to 100 thereof.", "121    However, it was without reference to that decision and on the basis of its own interpretation of the tax and accounting rules applicable under Spanish law that the General Court concluded that the objective of the rules on the amortisation of financial goodwill contained in the Corporate Tax Law, as approved by Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004, was to ensure consistency between the tax treatment and accounting treatment of goodwill and that, in the light of that objective, the situation of undertakings investing in Spanish companies is comparable to that of undertakings investing in non-resident companies.", "122    Consequently, by substituting its own reasoning for that of the decision at issue, the General Court erred in law.", "123    It is necessary, however, to examine whether, notwithstanding the error of law made by the General Court, the second complaint of the first plea in law relied on by WDFG in support of its action before that court should in any event have been rejected, inasmuch as it criticised the Commission for failing to demonstrate that the acquisitions of shareholdings in resident companies and those in non-resident companies were comparable in the light of the objective of fiscal neutrality pursued by the measure at issue.", "124    Indeed, according to settled case-law, if the grounds of a judgment of the General Court disclose an infringement of EU law but the operative part is shown to be well founded on other legal grounds, such an infringement is not capable of bringing about the setting aside of that judgment (judgments of 30 September 2003, Biret International v Council, C‑93/02 P, EU:C:2003:517, paragraph 60 and the case-law cited, and of 14 October 2014, Buono and Others v Commission, C‑12/13 P and C‑13/13 P, EU:C:2014:2284, paragraph 62 and the case-law cited).", "125    In that regard, it must be borne in mind that, in accordance with the case-law mentioned in paragraph 35 above, to which the General Court was fully entitled to refer in paragraph 145 of the judgment under appeal, the examination of comparability at the second stage of the analysis of selectivity must be carried out in the light of the objective of the reference system and not that of the measure at issue.", "126    In the present case, the appellants submit that the objective of the reference system, which, in their view, is indissociable from that of the measure at issue, is to preserve fiscal neutrality.", "They state that, in the light of that objective, undertakings which acquire shareholdings in domestic companies and those which acquire shareholdings in cross-border companies are in different situations because of the obstacles to cross-border business combinations.", "127    As the Court of Justice has held, a measure such as the measure at issue, which is designed to facilitate exports, may be regarded as selective if it benefits undertakings carrying out cross-border transactions, in particular investment transactions, and is to the disadvantage of other undertakings which, while in a comparable factual and legal situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, carry out other transactions of the same kind within the national territory (judgment in WDFG, paragraph 119).", "128    In the present case, the General Court was fully entitled to find, in paragraph 122 of the judgment under appeal, that undertakings which acquire shareholdings in non-resident companies are, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax treatment of goodwill, in a comparable factual and legal situation to that of undertakings which acquire shareholdings in resident companies.", "Since undertakings which acquire cross-border minority shareholdings may benefit from the measure at issue even though they are not affected by the alleged obstacles to business combinations to which WDFG refers, it cannot be claimed that, because of those obstacles, the beneficiaries of the measure at issue are in a different legal and factual situation from that of undertakings covered by the normal tax system.", "129    In the light of those considerations, it must be concluded that, notwithstanding the error of law by the General Court in substituting its own reasoning for that of the decision at issue in the examination of the definition of the reference system’s objective, the second part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal and the third part of the Kingdom of Spain’s single ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "C.", "The third part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal and the fourth part of the Kingdom of Spain’s single ground of appeal, alleging an error of law in the allocation of the burden of proof", "1.", "Arguments of the parties", "130    The appellants submit that by failing to examine, during the first and second stages of the analysis of selectivity, which undertakings were in a comparable situation in the light of the reference system’s objective of fiscal neutrality and by deferring that examination to the third stage, the General Court reversed the burden of proof.", "In that regard, it follows from the case-law that, during the first and second stages of the examination of the selectivity of a measure, the burden of proving that the situations are comparable in the light of the objective pursued lies with the Commission.", "131    The Commission contends that the appellants’ arguments are inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.", "2.", "Findings of the Court", "132    In the first place, as regards the plea of inadmissibility raised by the Commission in respect of the appellants’ arguments, it must be rejected on the same grounds as those set out in paragraphs 56 to 58 above.", "A party is entitled to put forward pleas and arguments arising from the judgment under appeal itself and which seek to criticise, in law, its correctness.", "The appellants are, therefore, entitled to call into question the findings made by the General Court, irrespective of the fact that they did not put forward at first instance arguments intended specifically to challenge the decision at issue on that point.", "133    As regards the merits of the third part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal and the fourth part of the Kingdom of Spain’s single ground of appeal, the appellants complain specifically that the General Court took account of the fact that the measure at issue pursued an objective of fiscal neutrality only at the third stage of the analysis of the selectivity of the measure at issue, and not at the first and second stages of that analysis.", "134    The appellants’ arguments are based on the premiss that the General Court erred in law in determining the reference system’s objective as the consistency between the tax treatment and accounting treatment of goodwill, and not the principle of fiscal neutrality.", "135    Suffice it to note in that regard that, as is apparent from the considerations set out in paragraphs 116 to 129 above, although the General Court erred in finding that the objective of the reference system concerned the consistency between the tax treatment and accounting treatment of goodwill, it has not been established that the objective of fiscal neutrality was such as to preclude the aid from being found to be selective at the second stage of the analysis of selectivity.", "136    The third part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal and the fourth part of the Kingdom of Spain’s single ground of appeal must, therefore, be rejected as ineffective.", "D.", "The fourth part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal, alleging an error in the application of the principle of proportionality", "1.", "Arguments of the parties", "137    WDFG submits, in essence, that the General Court erred in law by examining the proportionality of the measure at issue without having first assessed whether the situations at issue were comparable in the light of the correctly identified objective of the reference system, namely fiscal neutrality.", "It submits that the examination of the measure at issue from the point of view of compliance with the principle of proportionality, at the third stage of the analysis of selectivity, serves no purpose and has no justification in the present case.", "It is only after examining whether the measure discriminates between comparable situations in the light of its objective that it should be considered whether that measure is justified by the fact that it is inherent to the essential principles of the system of which it forms part and complies with the principles of consistency and proportionality.", "138    The Commission contends that the fourth part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal is ineffective and, in any event, unfounded.", "2.", "Findings of the Court", "139    It must be stated that WDFG’s arguments are based on the premiss that the General Court erred in law by deferring the analysis of the proportionality of the measure at issue to the third stage of the examination of selectivity.", "140    Those arguments cannot, however, be upheld, since, as is apparent from the case-law, the question whether a selective advantage complies with the principle of proportionality arises at the third stage of the examination of selectivity, which examines whether that advantage can be justified by the nature or general scheme of the tax system of the Member State concerned.", "At that stage, the Member State is thus called on to demonstrate that a difference in treatment arising from the measure’s objective is consistent with the principle of proportionality, in that it does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective and the objective could not be achieved by less restrictive measures (see, to that effect, judgment of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraph 75).", "141    Consequently, the fourth part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal must also be rejected.", "E.", "The fifth part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal, alleging an error of law relating to the causal link between the impossibility of cross-border mergers and the acquisition of shareholdings in foreign companies", "1.", "Arguments of the parties", "142    WDFG submits, in essence, that the grounds of the judgment under appeal relating to the third stage of the analysis of selectivity, set out in paragraphs 180 to 189 of the judgment under appeal, are vitiated by an error of law since the General Court required proof from the Kingdom of Spain of the existence of ‘a causal link between the impossibility of merging abroad and the acquisition of shareholdings abroad’.", "WDFG submits, first, that those grounds introduce an element of analysis which does not appear in the decision at issue and indeed conflicts with its rationale and, secondly, that the proof requested by the General Court is impossible to furnish.", "143    The Commission contends that the fifth part of the single ground of appeal should be rejected.", "2.", "Findings of the Court", "144    It should be noted that, in paragraphs 180 to 189 of the judgment under appeal, which are the only paragraphs referred to in the fifth part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal, the General Court set out the reasons why the Kingdom of Spain had failed to establish that the measure at issue offset the alleged detrimental effects of the normal regime.", "145    However, as a supplementary point, it continued its analysis on the assumption that such offsetting had been demonstrated (paragraphs 190 to 198 of the judgment under appeal).", "The grounds of the judgment under appeal referred to in the fifth part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal are not, therefore, the only grounds on which the General Court based its conclusion that the Commission did not err in finding that the Kingdom of Spain had not justified the differentiation introduced by the measure at issue.", "146    In accordance with settled case-law, on an appeal, a plea that is directed against a ground in the judgment under appeal, the operative part of which is sufficiently founded in law on other grounds, is ineffective and must, therefore, be rejected.", "In the present case, even if the fifth part of the single ground of appeal were well founded, it must, inasmuch as it is incapable of invalidating the judgment under appeal, be rejected as ineffective, since the conclusion in question remains well-founded on other grounds (see, to that effect, judgment of 29 March 2011, Anheuser-Busch v Budějovický Budvar, C‑96/09 P, EU:C:2011:189, paragraph 211 and the case-law cited).", "147    It follows that the fifth part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal must be rejected as ineffective.", "F.", "The sixth part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal, alleging an error of law in the examination of the severability of the measure at issue according to the percentage of control", "1.", "Arguments of the parties", "148    WDFG complains that the General Court rejected its plea that was based on the absence of any distinction, in the Commission’s analysis, between acquisitions of minority shareholdings and acquisitions of majority shareholdings.", "WDFG states, first, that all the transactions it carried out in the context of the measure at issue led to the acquisition of control over the target company and, secondly, that the Kingdom of Spain had asked the Commission to analyse the two situations separately.", "According to WDFG, it is clear from the case-law that if the Member State concerned so requests, the Commission is required to conduct a separate analysis of the measure under examination.", "As to the severability of the measure at issue, this is apparent from the procedural treatment which the Commission accorded to the analysis of that measure, which resulted in three different decisions.", "2.", "Findings of the Court", "149    The sixth part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal is directed against paragraphs 206 to 215 of the judgment under appeal, by which the General Court examined whether the Commission was required to distinguish between the various transactions which benefited from the application of the measure at issue.", "150    In the present case, it must be stated that the grounds of the judgment under appeal set out in those paragraphs – which were intended to respond to WDFG’s argument that it was for the Commission to distinguish between acquisitions of shareholdings in non-resident companies resulting in the acquisition of control and other acquisitions of shareholdings, in order to declare that the application of the measure at issue to the acquisitions of shareholdings in non-resident companies did not entail classification as State aid – were included for the sake of completeness.", "151    Indeed, WDFG’s argument that the Commission was required to make such a distinction was rejected, principally, in paragraph 205 of the judgment under appeal, in which the General Court held, in essence, that the inconsistency introduced by the measure at issue in respect of the tax treatment of goodwill would exist even if that measure benefited only acquisitions of majority shareholdings in non-resident companies.", "152    As has been pointed out in paragraph 146 above, on an appeal a plea that is directed against a ground included for the sake of completeness in the judgment under appeal, the operative part of which is sufficiently founded in law on other grounds, is ineffective and must, therefore, be rejected.", "153    In any event, WDFG’s arguments in the sixth part of its single ground of appeal are unfounded.", "154    In that regard, it is true that, in the decision which it adopts at the end of its examination, the Commission may, in the exercise of its discretion, differentiate between the beneficiaries of the aid scheme notified, having regard to certain characteristics they display or conditions which they fulfil.", "On the other hand, as the General Court rightly pointed out in paragraph 206 of the judgment under appeal, it was not for the Commission, in the decision at issue, to determine conditions for the application of the measure at issue which might have made it possible, in certain situations, for it not to classify that measure as aid.", "Such a question is a matter for dialogue between the Spanish authorities and the Commission, as part of the notification of the scheme at issue, which ought to have taken place before the scheme was put into effect.", "155    In the present case, in its action at first instance, WDFG complained that the Commission, in essence, failed to distinguish between acquisitions of shareholdings in non-resident companies resulting in the acquisition of control and other acquisitions of shareholdings for the purposes of declaring that the application of the measure at issue to that former category of acquisitions of shareholdings in non-resident companies did not entail classification as State aid.", "In that regard, the General Court recalled, in paragraph 212 of the judgment under appeal, that, with regard to the justification for the distinction drawn by the measure at issue, it is for the Member State concerned to establish that that distinction is justified and also to amend the content or the conditions for the application of that measure if it is apparent that it is justified only in part.", "The General Court did not err in law in concluding therefrom, in paragraph 214 of the judgment under appeal, that, even if the Commission’s examination, during the formal investigation procedure, of cases regarding the acquisition of majority shareholdings was discussed specifically by the Commission and the Kingdom of Spain on the basis of the documented requests submitted by that Member State, WDFG’s complaint had, in any event, to be rejected in the circumstances of the case.", "156    Consequently, the sixth part of WDFG’s single ground of appeal must be rejected as ineffective and, in any event, unfounded.", "157    Since none of the parts of the single ground of appeal raised by the appellants in support of their respective appeals has been upheld, those appeals must be dismissed in their entirety.", "V.", "Costs", "158    Under Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs.", "In accordance with Article 138(1) of those rules of procedure, applicable to the procedure on an appeal by reason of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "159    In the present case, since the Commission has applied for costs and the appellants have been unsuccessful, the appellants must be ordered to pay the costs of the present appeals and of the proceedings before the General Court.", "160    In accordance with Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure, applicable to the procedure on appeal by reason of Article 184(1) thereof, the Member States which have intervened in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.", "Consequently, the Federal Republic of Germany, intervener in the action before the General Court and having participated in the proceedings before the Court of Justice, must bear its own costs.", "On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby:", "1.", "Dismisses the appeals;", "2.", "Orders World Duty Free Group SA and

Association v Commission (T‑140/13, EU:T:2014:1029; ‘the judgment under appeal’), whereby the General Court dismissed the action for the annulment of Commission Decision C(2012) 8252 final of 20 November 2012 relating to State aid SA.34736 (2012/N) — Spain — Early depreciation of certain assets acquired through a financial leasing (‘the contested decision’).", "Legal context", "2 Council

complaint", "4 The appellant, an association representing the interests of Dutch shipyards, lodged a complaint, together with other associations, against a Spanish tax scheme promoting the construction of vessels in Spanish shipyards (‘the previous early depreciation scheme’).", "According to the complainants, that scheme made it possible to secure a rebate of 20% to 30% on the construction price of a vessel (‘the rebate’).", "Opening decision concerning the previous Spanish tax lease system", "5 On 29 June 2011 the European Commission initiated a procedure, under Article 108(2) TFEU, against the tax rules on leasing, by adopting Decision C(2011) 4494 final (State aid SA.21233 (11/C) (ex NN/11, ex CP 137/06) — Tax regime applicable to certain finance lease agreements, also known as the Spanish Tax Lease System) (summarised in OJ 2011 C 276, p. 5) (‘the Opening Decision’).", "That tax regime concerned a set of rules and arrangements involving, with respect to each order for the construction of a vessel, several parties, namely, a shipping company, a shipyard, a bank, several investors and a leasing (lease-sale) company.", "According to the Opening Decision, those arrangements operated as illustrated in the following diagram:", "Image not found", "6 Initially, the shipping company which wanted to purchase a vessel and to take advantage of the rebate agreed with a shipyard on the ship to be built and on the purchase price, namely the net price.", "This initial contract provided for the payment of regular instalments.", "However, in order to qualify for the rebate, the company undertook not to purchase the vessel directly from the shipyard but from an Economic Interest Group (EIG) set up by a bank, which brought together a number of investors.", "Profits and losses made by the EIG were apportioned among its members on a pro rata basis according to their holdings.", "7 Thereafter, the leasing company purchased the vessel from the shipyard, and then leased it to the EIG, which thus enabled its investor members to deduct from their tax bases the instalments paid to the leasing company.", "As regards those regular payments, the leasing contract provided for one extra instalment over and above those stipulated in the initial contract.", "The amount of this extra instalment constituted the rebate, which is the difference between the net price set out in the initial contract and the gross price actually paid by the leasing company to the shipyard.", "8 At the end of the leasing contract, with a duration of three to four years, the EIG undertook to purchase the vessel from the leasing company.", "That vessel was then resold to the shipping company at the net price, as initially agreed.", "9 According to the Opening Decision, the arrangements described in paragraphs 5 to 8 above sought to secure tax advantages within the EIG, advantages which were then apportioned among the parties concerned.", "10 First, according to Spanish accounting rules, costs arising from the use of an asset were not to be influenced by its method of financing.", "Accordingly, leased assets could be depreciated in the same way as assets which were otherwise financed.", "Article 115 of the Royal legislative decree 4/2004 approving the coordinated text of the law on corporate taxation (Real Decreto Legislativo 4/2004, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley del Impuesto sobre Sociedades) of 5 March 2004 (BOE No 61, of 11 March 2004, p. 10951; ‘the LIS’), dealt with the tax treatment of certain leasing transactions.", "11 Article 115(6) of the LIS permitted accelerated depreciation, over three to four years, of payments made under a leasing contract, in order to make it possible to depreciate a vessel for tax purposes faster than its real wear and tear.", "Furthermore, Article 115(11) of the LIS enabled the depreciation to be brought forward so that it started before the asset became operational, that is as soon as construction began.", "That possibility of early depreciation, which was available to EIGs under certain conditions pursuant to Article 48(4) of the LIS, was subject to prior authorisation from the Spanish Ministry for Economic Affairs and Finance.", "The authorisation procedure was governed by Article 49 of Royal legislative decree 1777/2004 approving the regulation on corporate taxation (Real Decreto 1777/2004, por el que se aprueba el Reglamento del Impuesto sobre Sociedades), of 30 July 2004 (BOE No 189 of 6 August 2004, p. 37072; ‘the RIS’).", "12 Accelerated and early depreciation increased the costs of the EIG and created losses for it, which the investors could deduct from their tax bases.", "It also artificially decreased the tax value of the vessel compared to its real value.", "That capital gain amounted to a hidden liability which, according to the normal rules on corporation tax, was taxable if the vessel was resold.", "13 Second, before reselling the vessel to the shipping company pursuant to the bareboat charter contract, the EIG applied for authorisation from the tax authorities to opt out of the normal corporation tax system and opt into the tonnage tax system provided for in Articles 124 and 128 of the LIS, which provided for the taxation of activities related to shipping based on the tonnage of vessels.", "It replaced normal corporation tax.", "Article 125(2) of the LIS governed the taxation of capital gains made when a vessel was resold.", "For that purpose, it provided for the taxation of capital gains made on the sale of vessels which were subject to the tonnage tax system, where those gains were the result of an over-depreciation carried out before those vessels entered that system.", "14 However, the effect of Article 50(3) of the RIS was that the ring fence rule laid down in Article 125(2) of the LIS did not apply if the vessel was purchased under a leasing contract approved beforehand by the tax authorities on the basis of Article 115(11) of the LIS.", "Such a vessel was considered to be new, irrespective of whether it had already been used or whether it had already been depreciated.", "Switching to the tonnage tax system therefore enabled the EIG to avoid taxation on the capital gain of the over-depreciated vessel.", "15 Together, those provisions placed the EIG in a position to, on the one hand, create losses which its member investors could deduct from their tax bases and, on the other, to avoid taxation on the capital gain of the over-depreciated vessel.", "The combination of these effects made it possible to secure a tax gain corresponding to approximately 30% of the gross price paid by the leasing company to the shipyard.", "That gain was then apportioned among the investors in the EIG (10% to 15%) and the shipping company (85% to 90%).", "16 In the Opening Decision, the Commission considered that the advantages flowing from the previous early depreciation scheme constituted State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, in favour of all the parties involved in the vessel leasing scheme.", "The Commission observed that the system was used almost exclusively in transactions involving shipping companies purchasing vessels from Spanish shipyards.", "According to the Commission, all those transactions also involved leasing companies and wealthy Spanish taxpayers grouped together in EIGs under the aegis of structures put in place by Spanish banks.", "The Commission considered, inter alia, that the early depreciation scheme provided for in Article 115(11) of the LIS contained an element of selectivity, since it required an authorisation from the tax authority covering all the effects of the leasing contract.", "The Commission added that it had approved the tonnage tax system in Decision C(2002) 582 final of 27 February 2002.", "However, the Commission noted that Article 50(3) of the RIS, which enables the effects of the ring fence rule in Article 125(2) of the LIS to be nullified, was not notified to the Commission and, as such, had not been approved by it.", "Administrative procedure concerning the new early depreciation scheme", "17 By letter of 29 May 2012 the Kingdom of Spain gave notification to the Commission of an amended version of Article 115(11) of the LIS (‘the amended Article 115(11) of the LIS’).", "The measure thus notified reads as follows:", "‘By writing to the Ministry of Finance and Public Authorities under the terms laid down by regulation, lessees will be able to choose to establish that the time referred to in paragraph 6 corresponds to the time of the effective start of the construction of the asset, provided that the following requirements are met:", "– the assets are tangible and are the subject of a financial leasing agreement in which the contractual fees are largely settled before the completion of the construction of the asset;", "– the construction of these assets will take at least twelve months;", "– the assets meet unique technical and design criteria and could not have been mass produced.’", "18 In response to the Commission’s requests for information, the Kingdom of Spain provided additional information on 6 June and 22 August 2012.", "After a meeting between the Commission and the Kingdom of Spain on 4 September 2012, the latter submitted an amended version of the notified measure on 24 September 2012.", "The Kingdom of Spain also sent to the Commission additional requested information on 26 September and 5 October 2012.", "19 During the examination conducted by the Commission, the appellant wrote to the Commission on 6 July, 24 and 27 August and 20 November 2012 requesting information on the progress of the examination of the notified measure and submitting that third parties should be given the opportunity to comment on the notified measure.", "The contested decision", "20 By the contested decision, the Commission held that the notified measure did not constitute State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, and was, due to there being no selective advantage, compatible with the internal market.", "21 According to the contested decision, the application of the amended Article 115(11) of the LIS is optional and no longer requires prior authorisation.", "Mere notification to the tax authorities is sufficient.", "Further, the Spanish authorities confirmed that that provision required no implementing measure, and consequently the conditions for application previously laid down by Article 48(4) of the LIS and Article 49 of the RIS were no longer relevant and would be repealed.", "According to that decision, the Spanish authorities also confirmed that Article 50(3) of the RIS would be repealed, and consequently the ring fence measure laid down in Article 125(2) of the LIS would henceforth apply to the capital gain realised on the transfer of over-depreciated vessels from the normal tax system to the tonnage tax system.", "22 In the contested decision, the Commission analysed whether the notified measure was such as to favour certain undertakings or certain sectors of activity for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "23 The Commission noted, first, that that measure was applicable to all the companies which are subject to income tax in Spain without distinction according to sectors of activity, places of establishment, size or legal status.", "The fact that the measure applied only to assets acquired through a leasing contract did not give rise to a selective advantage, as all kinds of assets can be financed through leasing contracts, which can be used by companies of all sizes operating in all sectors of activity.", "The Commission also noted that, according to the Spanish authorities, the notified measure applied both to assets built in Spain and those built in other Member States.", "24 Next, although the notified measure made the possibility of early depreciation subject to several conditions and although it excluded mass-produced assets, the Commission considered that those restrictions were aimed at limiting the possibility of early depreciation to cases where the lessee was required to pre-finance the asset and therefore bear the financial cost of the asset before it became operational.", "Those restrictions were therefore justified, in the view of the Commission, by reason of the nature and internal logic of the Spanish tax system.", "25 Last, the Commission observed that the conditions imposed by the notified measure were sufficiently precise and objective so as to preclude a discretionary or discriminatory application of the measure by the tax authorities.", "The Commission also held that that application was not subject to prior authorisation from those authorities.", "26 Accordingly, the Commission concluded in the contested decision that the notified measure did not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal", "27 By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 8 March 2013, the appellant brought an action for annulment of the contested decision.", "28 In support of its action, the appellant relied on a single plea in law, alleging infringement of Article 108(3) TFEU and Article 4(2) and (3) of Regulation No 659/1999.", "29 The General Court rejected that single plea in law as being unfounded, and consequently dismissed the action.", "Forms of order sought by the parties and procedure before the Court", "30 By its appeal, the appellant claims that the Court should:", "– set aside the judgment under appeal;", "– annul the contested decision or, in the alternative, refer the case back to the General Court for determination in accordance with the judgment of the Court as to points of law, and", "– order the Commission to pay the costs, including those incurred in the proceedings before the General Court.", "31 The Commission contends that the Court should:", "– dismiss the appeal; and", "– order the appellant to pay the costs at both first instance and on appeal.", "32 The Kingdom of Spain claims that the Court should:", "– dismiss the appeal;", "– in the alternative, if the Court upholds the appeal, declare the action for annulment to be inadmissible, and", "– order the appellant to pay the costs.", "The appeal", "33 In support of its appeal, the appellant relies on three grounds.", "In those grounds of appeal it is claimed, first, that the General Court did not properly take account of all the arguments relied on by the appellant at first instance; second, that the General Court substituted reasons for those of the Commission and committed a manifest error of assessment, and, third, that the reasons stated in the judgment under appeal are insufficient and contradictory.", "The first ground of appeal: the General Court failed properly to take account of all the arguments relied on by the appellant at first instance", "Arguments of the parties", "34 By its first ground of appeal, the appellant claims that General Court erred in failing properly to take account of all the arguments relied on by the appellant at first instance.", "35 In the first part of that ground of appeal, the appellant claims that the General Court misconstrued its argument concerning the fact that the effect of the tax leasing scheme should have been considered as a whole.", "In that regard, the appellant claims that the General Court should have analysed the amended Article 115(11) of the LIS in the light of certain tax rules currently in force, such as the rules on tonnage taxation and the rules on the fiscal status of EIGs.", "The appellant considers that its argument that the EIGs continued to benefit from a selective advantage notwithstanding the repeal of Article 50(3) RIS was not examined by the General Court.", "Consequently, the General Court failed to identify the fact that the analysis made by the Commission in the contested decision was incomplete.", "36 In the second part of this ground of appeal, the appellant considers that the General Court misinterpreted its argument that the vagueness of the criteria used in the new tax scheme might lead to the de facto selectivity of the notified measure, thereby conferring on the tax authorities, when conducting a post factum control, a discretion in the use of the tax advantages.", "The General Court, in paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal, failed to take account of either the uncertainties caused by such post factum control or the consequences with respect to the selectivity of the tax scheme at issue, but instead held that the appellant was claiming that the notified measure was not directly applicable.", "37 In the third part of this ground of appeal, the appellant claims that the General Court erred in failing to state the reasons why it held that it was permissible for the contested decision not to take into consideration the differentiation between the leasing companies and certain investors.", "The appellant also considers that the General Court did not set out the reasons why such selectivity should be deemed to be inherent in the logic of the new tax scheme.", "According to the appellant, that new system is selective, since it applies only to leasing companies with sufficiently large resources.", "If the General Court had properly taken those arguments into consideration, it would have held that the analysis made in the contested decision was incomplete.", "38 The Commission argues that this ground of appeal is unfounded.", "39 The Kingdom of Spain contends that this ground of appeal is, in part, inadmissible and, in part, unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "40 As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it must be pointed out that, in paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court correctly set out that argument, stating, inter alia, that the appellant was arguing that the Commission had not assessed the effect of the notified measure in its context.", "The appellant is claiming that it is apparent therefore from that paragraph that the Commission had confined itself to studying the effect of that measure in isolation.", "41 Further, the General Court investigated, in paragraphs 81 to 83 of the judgment under appeal, whether the Commission had taken account of the combined effect of the previous provisions and other provisions, fiscal and non-fiscal.", "In that regard, the General Court held that the Commission had examined, in recitals 16 to 23 of the contested decision, the relevance of the previous provisions in relation to the notified measure.", "In particular, the General Court held, in paragraph 83 of that judgment, that, given that the previous early depreciation scheme provisions were to be repealed and the application of the amended Article 115(11) of the LIS no longer required prior authorisation from the tax authorities, the question of the combined effects of the previous provisions simply no longer arose.", "42 The General Court cannot therefore be criticised for having misconstrued arguments raised before it by the appellant that concerned specifically, as is apparent from, inter alia, the application initiating the proceedings, the analysis of the combined effects of the tax measures and other provisions, fiscal and non-fiscal.", "43 For the remainder, the General Court did not for all that limit its examination to the previous early depreciation scheme.", "Thus, in paragraphs 84 to 88 of the judgment under appeal, it set out the appellant’s arguments on the de facto selectivity of the notified measure, to be analysed in the following paragraphs in order to come to the conclusion, in paragraph 92 of that judgment, that, with regard to the new tax scheme, ‘the Commission examined the question of whether the notified measure contained an element of selectivity’.", "While the General Court considered that examination to have been ‘succinct’, it nonetheless held that examination to have been sufficient, on the conclusion of reasoned argument set out in paragraphs 93 to 101 of that judgment, where the new tax provisions are dealt with.", "44 That being the case, the first part of the appellant’s first ground of appeal stems from a misreading of the judgment under appeal and must be rejected.", "45 As regards the second part of that ground of appeal, it is clear that the appellant claimed before the General Court that the fact that a measure is directly applicable and leaves no discretion to the authorities responsible for its implementation does not preclude that measure being selective.", "The appellant argued, in addition, that the amended Article 115(11) of the LIS was not directly applicable, since it contained a number of concepts that were subject to interpretation.", "46 In this instance, first, it is clear that that argument of the appellant is clearly stated in paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal.", "Second, the General Court replied to that argument in paragraph 82 of that judgment, holding that the Commission had assessed whether the application of the notified measure required prior authorisation or any implementation measures.", "47  Accordingly, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected as being unfounded.", "48  Last, as regards the third part of this ground of appeal, it is clear that the plea in law relied on by the appellant at first instance was designed to establish that the Commission had not undertaken a complete and sufficient examination of the selectivity of the measure at issue.", "Suffice it to observe that, in paragraph 91 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court described the examination carried out by the Commission in order to determine whether the amended Article 115(11) of the LIS contained an element of selectivity.", "The General Court concluded, in paragraph 92 of that judgment, that the Commission had indeed ‘examined the question of whether the notified measure contained an element of selectivity’.", "Further, in paragraphs 93 to 101 of that judgment, the General Court set out the reasons why it held that examination to be sufficient.", "Accordingly, the General Court cannot be criticised of having failed to state the reasons why it held that the examination undertaken by the Commission was sufficient.", "49  Further, as regards the argument concerning the selectivity of the measure at issue with respect to certain kinds of undertakings, suffice it to observe that the General Court, in paragraph 95 of the judgment under appeal, considered that the Commission was not required to make such an assessment, since the benefit of the early depreciation provided for in the amended Article 115(11) of the LIS is open to any kind of undertaking.", "50  It must also be stated, with respect to, in particular, the argument that the General Court failed to take into consideration the differentiation between leasing companies and certain investors, that the reasoning followed by the General Court, in paragraphs 91 to 101 of the judgment under appeal, necessarily implies the rejection of the arguments put forward by the appellant.", "Since the General Court is not required to reply exhaustively to each of the arguments put forward before it by the parties, it cannot be criticised of not having stated reasons for its findings (see, to that effect, the judgment in Gogos v Commission, C‑583/08 P, EU:C:2010:287, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).", "51  Consequently, the third part of the first ground of appeal must also be rejected.", "52  It follows from all the foregoing that the first ground of appeal must be rejected as being unfounded.", "The second ground of appeal: manifest error of assessment", "Arguments of the parties", "53 In its second ground of appeal, the appellant claims that the General Court, by substituting its own reasoning for that of the Commission in the contested decision, committed a manifest error of assessment.", "54 First, the appellant considers that the General Court, by holding, in paragraph 97 of the judgment under appeal, that the leasing companies, the EIGs, the investors and the banks could not benefit from the notified measure although there was no basis for such an assertion in either the contested decision or in the file, misconstrued that decision and therefore was led to commit a manifest error of assessment.", "55 Secondly, the appellant argues that, in paragraph 97 of that judgment, the General Court failed to determine whether the Commission had sufficiently examined, in the contested decision, the de facto selectivity conferred by the amended Article 115(11) of the LIS, which led the General Court to hold, wrongly, that that decision had been adopted after a full examination.", "Yet the appellant had identified, in the application initiating the proceedings, the potential beneficiaries of the new early depreciation scheme and had thereby placed the General Court in a position to assess the selectivity of the measure.", "56 The Commission and the Kingdom of Spain contend that this ground of appeal is unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "57  As regards the first argument, it must be recalled that, in accordance with the Court’s settled case-law, in proceedings for annulment, the General Court cannot substitute its own reasoning for that of the author of the contested act (see judgments in DIR International Film and Others v Commission, C‑164/98 P, EU:C:2000:48, paragraph 38, and British Aggregates v Commission, C‑487/06 P, EU:C:2008:757, paragraph 141).", "58  In this case, the General Court held, in paragraph 97 of the judgment under appeal, that those who are likely to benefit from the notified measure are the lessees, that is, the undertakings who pay the regular instalments required by that type of contract.", "The General Court observed, however, that since that measure was in principle applicable, as the Commission held in recitals 28 to 32 of the contested decision, to any undertaking of any size, active in any sector of the economy, there was therefore no need for the Commission’s examination to concern the leasing companies or the undertakings that the appellant classifies as ‘intermediaries’.", "Accordingly, it must be held that the General Court did not substitute its reasoning for that of the Commission with respect to the beneficiaries of that measure.", "59  As regards the second argument, it must be observed that that argument was properly presented in paragraphs 84 to 87 of the judgment under appeal and that the General Court replied to it in paragraphs 91 and 92 of that judgment, holding that the amended Article 115(11) of the LIS applied to a category of assets that was open and indeterminate.", "In particular, the General Court set out, in paragraph 91 of that judgment, the reasons that led the Commission to hold that that provision was a general measure that did not confer a selective advantage on its beneficiaries.", "60  Further, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one by one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, and the reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why the General Court has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (see judgment in FIAMM and Others v Council and Commission, C‑120/06 P and C‑121/06 P, EU:C:2008:476, paragraph 96 and the case-law cited).", "61  Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected in its entirety as being unfounded.", "The third ground of appeal; the reasons stated by the General Court are insufficient and contradictory", "Arguments of the parties", "62 In its third ground of appeal, which has four parts, the appellant argues that the reasons stated in paragraphs 95, 97, 99, 100 and 107 to 111 of the judgment under appeal are insufficient or contradictory.", "63 By the first part of this ground of appeal, the appellant argues that the reasons stated in paragraph 95 of the judgment under appeal are insufficient, in that the General Court inferred, from the supposed failure to challenge the status of the EIGs in the Opening Decision, that the Commission was under no obligation to determine whether the notified measure conferred a selective advantage on those entities and their investors.", "According to the appellant, the Commission should have examined whether any selective advantage was given to the investors grouped in EIGs who might thus acquire the right to early depreciation without becoming lessees.", "64 The appellant adds that the contention that the status of EIGs was not challenged in the Opening Decision in the context of the previous early depreciation scheme is not correct.", "Since it was stated, in the Opening Decision, that the application of that previous scheme might confer a selective advantage on the EIGs, the Commission should, in the contested decision, have assessed whether, following the legislative amendments, the new scheme produced any selective advantage.", "The appellant claims that the judgment under appeal failed to provide a sufficient and clear statement of the reasons why, despite that omission, that decision was to be deemed to be complete.", "65 By the second part of that ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court’s failure to state sufficient reasons, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, for the assertion that there was no need for the Commission to define a reference framework in order to analyse the effect of the notified measure.", "In that regard, the reasoning in paragraphs 98 to 100 of that judgment, relating to tax measures which have the effect of creating an advantage for a category of specific undertaking, is flawed.", "Thus, the General Court should have considered the possibility of de facto selectivity of that measure, given that that measure can be applied not to all types of assets, but solely to the assets defined in the LIS and solely to taxpayers who are active in very specific industries.", "66 By the third part of the third ground of appeal, the appellant claims that, although the General Court recognises in the judgment under appeal that there are four criteria defining eligibility for accelerated depreciation, the General Court examined only two, namely the criteria relating to production time exceeding 12 months and the requirement that the fees should largely be settled before completion of the construction of the asset.", "The appellant thus complains that the General Court failed to examine the effect of the criterion of custom-made design and the exclusion of assets that were mass-produced.", "In so doing, the General Court ignored the arguments advanced by the appellant at first instance that very few products satisfied the four criteria.", "Consequently, ‘by failing to examine whether the analysis in the contested decision was sufficient and complete with respect to all the criteria for defining assets eligible for the benefit of early depreciation’, the General Court erred in law.", "In particular, the General Court was in breach of the principle that the Commission must, if it considers that a measure is justified by the nature and internal structure of the system, thoroughly substantiate that conclusion.", "67 By the fourth part of the third ground of appeal, the appellant argues that, in paragraph 109 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court misinterpreted the test for the justification of ‘the differential nature of the tax measures’, as defined in the Commission Notice on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation (OJ 1998 C 384, p. 3; ‘the notice’).", "In that regard, the General Court held that differentiation in the tax system is allowed, provided that it is supported by a rational justification, whereas paragraph 23 of that notice states that such a differentiation is allowed if the ‘economic rationale [of the measures] makes them necessary to the functioning and effectiveness of the tax system’.", "68 The Commission and the Kingdom of Spain contend that the third ground of appeal is unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "69  It is clear that, by the third ground of appeal, the appellant is not arguing that the reasons stated in the judgment under appeal are insufficient, but is criticising the reasons stated by General Court as being, in its opinion, flawed in several respects.", "70  As regards the first part of the third ground of appeal, the appellant disputes the statement made by the General Court, in paragraph 95 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘the status of the EIGs was not challenged by the Opening Decision’, principally on the ground that that statement is of no relevance in so far as it relates to the previous early depreciation scheme, which is not the subject matter of the contested decision, and, alternatively, that the statement is not correct.", "71  It must be observed that the General Court held, in paragraph 93 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘the new version of Article 115(11) of the LIS is self-standing’ and that ‘[t]he answer to the question of whether the notified measure conferred a selective advantage cannot therefore be dependent on the effect of [the] previous provisions.", "It follows that it was no longer necessary to examine the question of whether it might be selective by comparison with the previous early depreciation scheme.’", "72  Further, the General Court stated, in paragraph 95 of that judgment, that ‘the benefit of the early depreciation provided for by the notified measure is available to any kind of undertaking’.", "73  It is apparent from reading paragraphs 93 and 95 of the judgment under appeal together, first, that those reasons are sufficient to justify, in law, rejection of the appellant’s argument that an insufficient examination was made, in the contested decision, of the situation of the EIGs.", "It follows, secondly, that the statement that ‘the status of the EIGs was not challenged by the Opening Decision’, made in paragraph 95 of the judgment under appeal, was made for the sake of completeness.", "74  Consequently, the first part of the third ground of appeal, in that it is directed against a reason stated for the sake of completeness, must be rejected as being ineffective.", "75  By the second part of this ground of appeal, the appellant disputes the validity of the reasoning in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which, in its opinion, is flawed.", "The appellant claims that the tax scheme at issue confers, de facto, a selective advantage on a limited number of undertakings.", "Consequently, the General Court should have examined the possibility of de facto selectivity.", "76  However, it is clear that the General Court stated, in paragraph 98 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘the notified measure is a general tax measure’.", "The General Court set out, in paragraphs 90 and 99 of that judgment, the relevant principles stemming from the case-law, which principles have not been challenged by the appellant in its appeal.", "The General Court, in paragraph 91 of that judgment, rejected the appellant’s arguments as to the insufficiency of the examination by the Commission of the selectivity of the national measure at issue.", "That being the case, the General Court was entitled to take the view, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, that the criteria of the previously cited case-law did not apply to the notified measure as regards whether it should be defined as conferring a selective advantage, and that ‘there was no need for the Commission to define a reference framework in order to analyse the effect of the notified measure’.", "77  Accordingly, the second part of the third ground of appeal is unfounded.", "78  As regards the third part of that ground of appeal, directed against paragraphs 107 and 111 of the judgment under appeal, the appellant claims, in essence, that General Court failed to assess whether the Commission had examined the selectivity of the notified measure with all due diligence.", "79 It must be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law, the concept of ‘State aid’ does not refer to State measures which differentiate between undertakings and which are, therefore, prima facie selective where that differentiation arises from the nature or the overall structure of the system of which they are part (judgments in Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 145 and the case-law cited, and BNP Paribas and BNL v Commission, C‑452/10 P, EU:C:2012:366, paragraph 101).", "In carrying out the necessary comprehensive review of the characterisation of the tax scheme at issue as State aid, the General Court had to examine whether the differentiation between undertakings arising from that scheme was due to the nature or general scheme of the tax system of which it formed part (judgment in BNP Paribas and BNL v Commission, C‑452/10 P, EU:C:2012:366, paragraph 102).", "80  In this case, it is apparent from paragraphs 102 to 105 of the judgment under appeal that the appellant disputed the finding, in paragraphs 31 and 32 of the contested decision, that any selectivity of the notified measure is inherent in the general tax scheme and justified by the logic of that scheme.", "The appellant considered that that analysis was contrary, on the one hand, to the Commission’s previous decision-making practice and, on the other, to the notice.", "81  The General Court responded to that argument, in paragraphs 107 to 111 of the judgment under appeal, as follows:", "‘107 It must be observed that, according to paragraph 31 of the contested decision, the conditions imposed by the notified measure restrict the possibility of early depreciation to certain assets.", "The Commission considered, however, that those restrictions were justified by factors relating to the period of construction of a custom-built asset and the need to meet pre-financing costs during that period.", "108 That explanation can readily be understood, particularly if the notified measure is compared to Article 115(6) of the LIS concerning accelerated depreciation.", "The new version of Article 115(11) of the LIS derogates from that provision only to the extent that it allows the possibility of altering the date from which that accelerated depreciation is to occur.", "Article 115(6) of the LIS allows the accelerated depreciation of assets financed by a leasing contract only from the date on which the asset is actually available.", "However, given that, as regards custom-built assets which are the subject of the new version of Article 115(11) of the LIS, the greater part of the payment has already been made before that date, it is coherent to bring the date of depreciation into line with that of the payments to the leasing company.", "109 Contrary to what is claimed by [the appellant], the principles established by the Commission in paragraph 23 of [the notice] do not preclude that explanation.", "On the contrary, that notice allows differentiation within a tax system, provided that it is supported by a rational justification.", "110 Further, the Commission was not obliged to follow the analytical approaches which it had used in its decisions on depreciation in Germany and on depreciation in Spain of financial goodwill, referred to above in paragraphs 103 and 105 respectively [of the judgment under appeal], contrary to what is argued by [the appellant].", "Each case must be assessed separately according to the particular circumstances of the case (judgment of 1 July 2009 in KG Holding and Others v Commission, T‑81/07 to T‑83/07, ECR, EU:T:2009:237, paragraph 201).", "111 Last, as regards [the appellant’s] argument that the restriction of early depreciation to assets financed through leasing contracts is not objectively justified, it is clear that Article 115 of the LIS governs only leasing contracts.", "Consequently, the notified measure could concern only leasing contracts and not other forms of financing.’", "82  It is apparent from those reasons that, having set out the arguments made by the appellant, the General Court rejected them following an overall assessment in paragraphs 107 to 109 of the judgment under appeal.", "Moreover, in paragraphs 110 and 111 of that judgment, the General Court responded specifically to the appellant’s arguments concerning the Commission’s previous decision-making practice and the significance of leasing contracts for the analysis of the notified measure.", "Accordingly, the General Court justified its conclusion to the requisite legal standard, and it cannot be held that the General Court was obliged to extend its assessment of the selectivity of the notified measure by adding an exhaustive examination of each of the criteria governing eligibility for that measure.", "83  The General Court did not therefore err in law in the exercise of its review of whether the differentiation between undertakings caused by the scheme at issue was not caused by the nature or structure of the tax system of which it formed part.", "84  Accordingly, the third part of the third ground of appeal is unfounded.", "85  As regards the fourth part of that ground of appeal, the appellant complains that the General Court contradicted the notice, since the General Court held, in paragraph 109 of the judgment under appeal, that that notice allows differentiation within a tax system, provided that that differentiation is supported by a rational justification.", "86  In that regard, it must be observed that paragraph 23 of the notice states that ‘The differential nature of some measures does not necessarily mean that they must be considered to be State aid.", "This is the case with measures whose economic rationale makes them necessary to the functioning and effectiveness of the tax system.", "However, it is up to the Member State to provide such justification’.", "It is clear, on the one hand, that the General Court set out, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the wording of that paragraph 23 and, on the other, that the expression ‘rational justification’ used in paragraph 109 of that judgment, corresponds, in essence, to the criterion stated in paragraph 23 of the notice.", "87  Consequently, the fourth part of the third ground of appeal must be rejected as being unfounded, and the third ground of appeal must be rejected in its entirety as being, in part, inadmissible and, in part, unfounded.", "88 In the light of all the foregoing, the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.", "Costs", "89 In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court shall make a decision as to costs.", "90 Under Article 138(1) of those rules, which applies to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "91 Since the Commission has applied for costs against the Netherlands Maritime Technology Association and the latter has been unsuccessful in all its grounds of appeal, the Netherlands Maritime Technology Association must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission in these proceedings.", "92 Under Article 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, which applies to the procedure on appeal by virtue of

op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969; ‘the 1969 Law’), which provided for a specific tax scheme for the international financing activities of undertakings which are members of a group (‘the GFA

Law of 15 September 2005 states that, in regard to those taxpayers subject to corporation tax who, on 11 July 2001, met the conditions attached to the GFA scheme, Article 15b of the 1969 Law, and the provisions which flowed from it, remain applicable.", "Article 2 also provides that that transitional provision is to apply for a period of 10 years from the date on which the taxpayer was able to establish a reserve, without that period being able to extend beyond 31 December 2010.", "The background to the dispute", "The facts prior to the contested decision", "8.", "In the course of a period of general reflection on harmful tax competition, the Council of the European Union and the representatives of the Governments of the Member States adopted, on 1 December 1997, a resolution on a code of conduct for business taxation (OJ 1998 C 2, p. 2).", "In that context, the Member States agreed to dismantle progressively specific tax measures categorised as harmful, while the Commission expressed its intention to examine or re-examine, with regard to the rules governing State aid, the tax schemes in force in the Member States.", "9.", "In the course of that examination, the Commission, by letter of 12 February 1999, requested details on the GFA scheme from the Kingdom of the Netherlands.", "Those details were provided by that Member State in a letter of 8 March 1999.", "10.", "On 27 December 2000, Koninklijke FrieslandCampina NV (‘KFC’) submitted a request for GFA authorisation to the Netherlands tax authority.", "11.", "By letter of 11 July 2001, the Commission informed the Kingdom of the Netherlands of its decision to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) EC in respect of the GFA scheme (‘the 11 July 2001 decision’).", "That decision and the request to the interested parties to submit their observations on that scheme were published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (OJ 2001 C 306, p. 6).", "12.", "On 26 July 2001 the Netherlands tax authority informed KFC that it was initiating that procedure.", "Consequently, KFC’s request for GFA authorisation was suspended.", "13.", "By letter of 3 October 2002, the Kingdom of the Netherlands pointed out to the Commission that, having regard to the principles of protection of legitimate expectations and respect for acquired rights, the Commission should allow those undertakings then benefiting from the GFA scheme to continue to benefit from it until the expiry of those GFA authorisations which had been granted.", "14.", "On 5 December 2002, the Netherlands State Secretary for Finance adopted a decision which stated as follows:", "‘I have decided that, as and from today, any new request for the application of the [GFA] scheme will not be considered.’", "The contested decision", "15.", "In the contested decision, the Commission declared the GFA scheme to be incompatible with the common market.", "However, it acknowledged in points 111 and 112 of the grounds for that decision that, in so far as that scheme was comparable to the scheme established in Belgium by Royal Decree No 187 of 30 December 1982 on the taxation of coordination centres (‘the BCC scheme’), which had been regarded as not involving aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, the beneficiaries of the GFA scheme at the time of the 11 July 2001 decision could properly rely on the principle of protection of legitimate expectations.", "Therefore, on the basis of Article 14(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [88 EC] (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1), which provides, inter alia, that ‘[the] Commission shall not require recovery of the aid if this would be contrary to a general principle of Community law’, the Commission refrained from seeking recovery of the aid received under the GFA scheme.", "16.", "Furthermore, in Article 2 of the contested decision, the Commission accepted that the beneficiaries of the GFA scheme at the time of the 11 July 2001 decision could continue to benefit from that scheme until the 10-year GFA authorisations which had been granted to them by the Netherlands tax authority expired, or at the latest until 31 December 2010.", "In particular, taking account of the advances made at Community level in the field of combating harmful tax competition, and from the viewpoint of a progressive reduction in the number of beneficiaries of the GFA scheme, the Commission took the view, in point 118 of the grounds for the contested decision, that the beneficiaries of that scheme could continue, in view of the ‘exceptional circumstances’, both to constitute new reserves and use existing reserves.", "The facts subsequent to the contested decision", "17.", "By letter of 11 April 2003, the Kingdom of the Netherlands requested the Commission, inter alia, to confirm in writing that the transitional scheme provided for in Article 2 of the contested decision applied also to undertakings which, although not yet benefiting from GFA authorisation, had made a request for first GFA authorisation before 5 December 2002 – the date from which every new request for such authorisation had been refused – inasmuch as those undertakings met the conditions attached to the GFA scheme at the time of the 11 July 2001 decision.", "18.", "In a letter of 7 July 2003 the Commission stated that it was clear from point 118 of the grounds for the contested decision, and from Article 2 of the contested decision, that the transitional scheme provided for by that decision did not apply to those undertakings.", "It also stated that, if the Netherlands authorities were to grant GFA authorisation to the undertakings concerned, that would be equivalent to granting new aid in contravention of that decision.", "19.", "On 21 August 2003, the Netherlands tax authority rejected KFC’s request for GFA authorisation on the ground that the Commission had adopted a negative decision in relation to the GFA scheme, as explained in the Commission’s letter of 7 July 2003.", "The action before the Court of First Instance and the judgment under appeal", "20.", "Before the Court of First Instance,  KFC sought the annulment of Article 2 of the contested decision in so far as it excluded from the transitional scheme for which it provides operators who, at the time of the 11 July 2001 decision, had already lodged a request for GFA authorisation with the Netherlands tax authority but whose request had not yet been determined by that date.", "21.", "As is apparent from paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, KFC based its action on three pleas.", "The first of those contained two limbs, claiming, first, breach of the principle of protection of legitimate expectations and, second, that the Commission was under an obligation to determine whether there were any requests for GFA authorisation pending at the time of the 11 July 2001 decision.", "The second plea alleged breach of the principle of equal treatment, and the third plea alleged breach of the duty to give reasons.", "22.The Commission, primarily, submitted two pleas of inadmissibility and, in the alternative, requested the Court of First Instance to dismiss the action as unfounded.", "23.", "The Court of First Instance rejected the pleas of inadmissibility.", "In the first place, as regards the absolute bar owing to the lack of interest in bringing proceedings, the Court of First Instance found, in paragraph 72 of the judgment under appeal, that if the action was upheld KFC would be able to make certain claims against the Netherlands authorities in relation to benefiting from the GFA scheme or, at the very least, have them consider its request, which justifies the interest in bringing proceedings.", "24.", "As regards the absolute bar owing to the lack of standing, the Court of First Instance held, in paragraphs 94 and 98 of the judgment under appeal, that KFC is directly and individually concerned by the contested decision, because it forms part of a closed group of taxpayers whose requests for GFA authorisation were pending on the date at which the Netherlands authorities took the decision to suspend consideration of those requests.", "25.", "In paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal the Court of First Instance held that the fact that the requests of taxpayers belonging to that closed group concerned a first authorisation for the right to benefit from a given tax scheme, and not for the renewal of an existing authorisation – as was the situation in Joined Cases C‑182/03 and C‑217/03 Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission [2006] ECR I‑5479 – is not such as to preclude the finding that those taxpayers are specifically affected by the contested decision.", "26.", "Subsequently, the Court of First Instance upheld KFC’s action and annulled Article 2 of the contested decision in so far as it excluded from the transitional scheme for which it provides those operators who, at the time of the 11 July 2001 decision, had lodged a request with the Netherlands tax authority for GFA authorisation but whose request had not yet been determined.", "27.", "The Court of First Instance held that the first and second pleas, alleging breach of the principles of protection of legitimate expectations and of equal treatment respectively, were well founded.", "28.", "As regards breach of the principle of protection of legitimate expectations, the Court of First Instance stated, in paragraphs 125 and 126 of the judgment under appeal, that, since that principle seeks to ensure that situations and legal relationships which are governed solely by Community law remain foreseeable, it does not concern legal situations which are governed solely by national law.", "Therefore, the question whether KFC is a beneficiary of the GFA, and the question whether it meets the conditions enabling it benefit from that scheme, are irrelevant for the assessment of whether it has a legitimate expectation with regard to the compatibility of the GFA scheme with Community law.", "29.", "Referring to Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission , cited above, the Court of First Instance pointed out, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, that the application of the principle of protection of legitimate expectations requires a Community institution to have caused an individual to entertain expectations which are justified, on the basis of precise assurances given by that institution, as the legitimate nature of expectation required implies that a prudent and circumspect economic operator could have reasonably relied upon the situation resulting from the act or conduct of the institution in question being maintained.", "It also recalled that an overriding public interest may, nevertheless, preclude the protection which that principle confers.", "30.", "In the present case, as regards, first, the existence of an expectation on the part of KFC, the Court of First Instance held, in paragraph 131 of the judgment under appeal, that for the reasons set out in points 111 and 112 of the grounds for the contested decision, referred to in paragraph 15 of the present judgment, the Commission’s conduct in respect of the BCC scheme created an expectation that the GFA scheme did not constitute a prohibited aid scheme.", "31.", "Second, as regards the legitimate nature of that expectation, the Court of First Instance held, in paragraphs 132 to 135 of the judgment under appeal, that the initiation, by the 11 July 2001 decision, of the formal investigation procedure with regard to the GFA scheme could not have pre‑judged how the Commission would classify that scheme in its final decision, with the result that the 11 July 2001 decision could not, in and of itself, preclude the possibility of KFC relying on the principle of protection of legitimate expe ctations.", "In paragraph 136 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance added that, even if that decision had been liable to undermine KFC’s expectation that the GFA scheme complied with the rules of the EC Treaty, KFC could have nevertheless expected that – on the basis of the Commission’s earlier assessment of a similar scheme, namely the BCC scheme – the contested decision would allow it the necessary time to take stock effectively of that change of assessment regarding the compatibility of the GFA scheme with the common market.", "32.", "In that regard, the Court of First Instance held, in paragraph 137 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘the period which passed between the publication of the decision to initiate the formal procedure, that is to say 31 October 2001, and the [contested] decision was insufficient to allow [KFC] to take into account the effect of a possible decision bringing an end to the scheme at issue.", "The undisputed fact that [KFC] has taken the measures it considers necessary to comply with the legal conditions attached to the GFA scheme … implies the implementation of accounting measures and financial and economic decisions which cannot be amended within a period of less than 15 months’.", "33.", "Third, as regards the balancing of KFC’s interest based on legitimate expectations, on the one hand, against a possible Community public‑policy interest, on the other, the Court of First Instance held, in paragraph 139 of the judgment under appeal, that, since the Commission itself had accepted in the contested decision that the current beneficiaries of the GFA scheme could invoke the protection of legitimate expectations in order to secure a transitional period which would allow them to continue to benefit from that scheme, both through the use of existing reserves and by means of the creation of new reserves, no overriding interest precluded the application of the principle of protection of legitimate expectations for the benefit of KFC.", "34.", "It is on the basis of those factors that the Court of First Instance upheld, in paragraph 140 of the judgment under appeal, KFC’s first plea in so far as it alleged breach of the principle of protection of legitimate expectations.", "35.", "As regards the second limb of that plea, the Court of First Instance then added, in paragraphs 141 to 143 of the judgment under appeal, that the issue as to whether the Community institution in question was actually aware of the situation of the operator, which intended to rely on the protection of legitimate expectations, is unconnected with the conditions under which that principle applies.", "In the light of the purpose of that principle, which is to ensure that situations and legal relationships which are governed by Community law remain foreseeable, its applicability cannot depend on whether the institution which has overturned an earlier assessment was actually informed of all the legal situations and relationships the predictability of which were affected by its change in attitude.", "For those reasons, the Court of First Instance held that the issue of the Commission’s actual knowledge of the genuine situation of KFC at the time of the 11 July 2001 decision was irrelevant for the assessment of the plea alleging breach of the principle of protection of legitimate expectations.", "36.", "Concerning KFC’s second plea, alleging breach of the principle of equal treatment, the Court of First Instance held, in paragraphs 149 and 150 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had infringed that principle by not providing for transitional measures in respect of taxpayers whose requests were still pending on the date of the notification of the contested decision.", "In that regard, the Court of First Instance based itself on its assessment of the plea alleging breach of the principle of protection of legitimate expectations.", "37.", "In those circumstances, the Court of First Instance took the view that it was not necessary to examine KFC’s third plea.", "Forms of order sought", "38.", "The Commission primarily  requests the Court to set aside the judgment under appeal, to dismiss KFC’s action seeking annulment of the contested decision, and to order KFC to pay the costs .", "In the alternative,  the Commission requests the Court to set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it grants rights to operators, other than KFC, which at the time of the 11 July 2001 decision had submitted a request for GFA authorisation to the Netherlands tax authority, and to dismiss the action for annulment of the contested decision in so far as it seeks to confer rights on such operators.", "39.", "KFC contends that the appeal should be dismissed and that the Commission should be ordered to pay the costs.", "The appeal", "40.", "In support of its appeal, the Commission submits six pleas.", "The first and second pleas allege that the Court of First Instance erred in law both in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal, by holding that KFC had an interest in bringing proceedings against the contested decision even if it did not meet the conditions laid down in Netherlands law for it to be able to benefit from the GFA scheme, and in paragraph 100 of that judgment, by finding that KFC was individually concerned by the contested decision.", "41.", "The third plea alleges that the Court of First Instance erred in law when, in paragraphs 141 to 143 of the judgment under appeal, it found that the fact that the Commission was unaware of KFC’s existence, of its situation, and that of the other undertakings which found themselves in an identical situation to KFC, was irrelevant for the purposes of determining whether KFC had a legitimate expectation.", "42.", "The fourth plea is set out in two limbs.", "The first limb alleges a distortion of the facts by the Court of First Instance in paragraph 137 of the judgment under appeal, and the second alleges that the Court of First Instance erred in law in its assessment, in paragraphs 125 to 140 of the judgment under appeal, of the legitimate expectation on which KFC was relying.", "43.", "The fifth plea alleges that the Court of First Instance committed an error of law in holding, in paragraphs 149 and 150 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had breached the principle of equal treatment by treating differently taxpayers who could all claim entitlement to the grant of a transitional period.", "44.", "Lastly, the sixth plea alleges that the Court of First Instance committed an error of law in that, in its formulation of the operative part of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance granted rights to all operators who had submitted a request for first GFA authorisation by 11 July 2001.", "The second plea", "Arguments of the parties", "45.", "By its second plea, which it is appropriate to examine first, the Commission claims that the Court of First Instance erred in law by holding, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, that KFC was individually concerned by the contested decision.", "KFC was not individually concerned, according to the Commission, because that decision is a measure of general application and, as KFC was not a beneficiary of the GFA scheme, it belonged to an open group of potential beneficiaries of that scheme.", "The fact that KFC had submitted a request for GFA authorisation before the 11 July 2001 decision is of no consequence in that regard.", "In addition, the Commission was not aware of the existence of undertakings in an identical situation to that of KFC, which did not make use of the possibility, provided for by Article 88(2) EC, to submit comments in the course of the formal investigation procedure relating to the GFA scheme, initiated by the 11 July 2001 decision.", "46.", "In particular, the Commission criticises the Court of First Instance for failing to distinguish KFC’s situation, involving a request for first authorisation, from that involving a request for renewal of authorisation, as in Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission .", "According to the Commission, KFC is affected in the same way as all other undertakings which have never benefited from the GFA scheme, and is not ‘specifically’ affected, as the undertakings covered by the judgment in Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission were in relation to the BCC scheme, and for whom the existing situation would have been amended by the decision which was annulled by that judgment, which is not the case for KFC in relation to the contested decision.", "Findings of the Court", "47.", "Under the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC, a natural or legal person may institute proceedings against a decision addressed to another person only if that decision is of direct and individual concern to the former.", "48.", "In relation to the first condition set out therein, it is settled case-law that, for a person to be directly concerned by a Community measure, that measure must directly affect the legal situation of the individual and leave no discretion to its addressees who are entrusted with the task of implementing it, such implementation being purely automatic and resulting from Community rules without the application of other intermediate rules (Case C‑386/96 P Dreyfus v Commission [1998] ECR I‑2309, paragraph 43 and the case‑law cited).", "49.", "In the present case, as the Court of First Instance held in paragraph 94 of the judgment under appeal, it is clear from Article 2 of the contested decision that the Netherlands Authorities were obliged, without having any discretion whatsoever in the matter, to reject any pending request for first GFA authorisation, as the undertakings which were not beneficiaries of the GFA scheme at the time of the 11 July 2001 decision could not benefit from the transitional scheme.", "50.", "In those circumstances, the Court of First Instance was correct to hold that the contested decision affected KFC directly.", "51.As regards the second condition set out in Article 230 EC, it should be borne in mind that the fact that  a disputed provision is, by its nature and scope, a provision of general application inasmuch as it applies to the traders concerned in general, does not of itself prevent it being of individual concern to some  ( Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission , paragraph 58 and the case‑law cited).", "52.", "However,  natural or legal persons may claim that a contested provision is of individual concern to them only if it affects them by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons  ( Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission , paragraph 59).", "53.", "An undertaking cannot, in principle, contest a Commission decision prohibiting a sectoral aid scheme if it is concerned by that decision solely by virtue of belonging to the sector in question and being a potential beneficiary of the scheme.", "Such a decision is, vis-à-vis that undertaking, a measure of general application covering situations which are determined objectively and entails legal effects for a class of persons envisaged in a general and abstract manner (Joined Cases 67/85, 68/85 and 70/85 Kwekeriij van der Kooy and Others v Commission [1988] ECR 219, paragraph 15; Case C‑6/92 Federmineraria and Others v Commission [1993] ECR I‑6357, paragraph 14; and Joined Cases C‑15/98 and C‑105/99 Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission [2000] ECR I‑8855, paragraph 33).", "54.", "By contrast, the Court has held that, where a contested measure affects a group of persons who were identified or identifiable when that measure was adopted by reason of criteria specific to the members of the group, those persons might be individually concerned by that measure inasmuch as they form part of a limited class of traders  (see Case 11/82 Piraiki-Patraiki and Others v Commission [1985] ECR 207, paragraph 31; Case C-152/88 Sofrimport v Commission [1990] ECR I‑2477, paragraph 11; and Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission , paragraph 60).", "55.It is not in dispute, first, that the contested decision had the effect that requests for first GFA authorisation, which were pending on the date of notification of the contested decision, were rejected without being examined and, second, that the undertakings concerned were easily identifiable, owing to the very existence of such a request, at the time when that decision was adopted.", "In that regard, it should be recalled that KFC was part of a group of, at most, 14 applicants for first GFA authorisation, whose requests were pending at the time of the 11 July 2001 decision, that those requests were suspended following that decision, and that the Netherlands authorities announced on 5 December 2002 that they would be ceasing, with immediate effect, to consider any new requests for the application of the GFA scheme.", "56.", "Thus, as the Court of First Instance stated correctly in paragraphs 98 and 100 of the judgment under appeal, KFC formed part of a closed group of undertakings – and not of an indefinite number of undertakings belonging to the sector concerned – specifically affected by the contested decision.", "57.", "It should be borne in mind that, in order to benefit from the GFA scheme, an undertaking which had made a request for first GFA authorisation must have had already taken the necessary measures in order to fulfil the criteria required for that scheme.", "Furthermore, as the Netherlands authorities did not have any discretion in that regard, they were obliged to grant such an authorisation if those criteria were fulfilled.Thus, the undertakings whose requests for first GFA authorisation were pending must be regarded as being concerned by the contested decision, by reason of attributes which are peculiar to them and by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from every other undertaking in that sector which had not lodged a request for first GFA authorisation.", "58.", "It follows that those undertakings have standing to bring an individual action against the contested decision.", "59.", "Doubt is not cast on that finding by the Commission’s argument that, first, it was unaware of the existence of undertakings in KFC’s situation and, second, KFC had not made use of the possibility, provided for in Article 88(2) EC, of submitting observations in the course of the formal investigation procedure of the GFA scheme.", "The Commission’s knowledge of the situation of the undertakings which had requested first GFA authorisation has no bearing on the fact that those undertakings may be individually affected by the contested decision.", "60.", "Accordingly, the Court of First Instance was right to find that KFC had standing to bring proceedings.", "61.", "It follows that the second plea must be rejected as unfounded.", "The first plea", "Arguments of the parties", "62.", "The Commission takes the view that, by holding, in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal, that KFC had an interest in bringing proceedings even though it did not meet the conditions of the GFA scheme, the Court of First Instance committed an error of law.", "It claims that, according to settled case‑law, the existence of an interest in bringing proceedings presupposes that the annulment of the contested measure would be capable, in and of itself, of having legal effects.", "Given that the annulment sought will be advantageous to KFC only if the Netherlands authorities state, subsequently, that it meets the conditions attached to the GFA scheme, should they not do so that annulment will have no legal effect on KFC’s situation.", "Findings of the Court", "63 According to settled case‑law, for an applicant to have an interest in bringing proceedings in the light of the subject‑matter of the action, that action must be capable, through its outcome, of procuring an advantage to the party which brought it (see, to that effect, Case C‑50/00 P Unión de Pequeños Agricultores v Council [2002] ECR I‑6677, paragraph 23; Case C‑277/01 P Parliament v Samper [2003] ECR I‑3019, paragraphs 30 and 31; order of 5 March 2009 in Case C‑183/08 P Commission v Provincia di Imperia , paragraph 19 and the case‑law cited).", "64.", "In the present case, it is not in dispute that, if the contested decision had extended the transitional scheme to include requests for first GFA authorisation that were pending on the date of notification of that decision, those requests would have been considered by the Netherlands authorities.In that regard, it should be recalled that those authorities had no discretionary power, as they were obliged to grant that authorisation if the criteria required to benefit from the GFA scheme were fulfilled.", "65.", "Thus, on the date on which it brought its action before the Court of First Instance, KFC had a vested and present interest in bringing proceedings against the contested decision, in so far as,  in the event that the contested decision were annulled, its request for first GFA authorisation would be considered, with the result that KFC could join that scheme if it were to fulfil the aforementioned criteria.As the Court of First Instance correctly held in paragraphs 59 and 66 of the judgment under appeal, that fact, on its own, was sufficient to procure an ‘advantage’ to KFC for the purposes of the case‑law mentioned in paragraph 63 of this judgment.", "66.", "The Commission’s submission that KFC did not fulfil the GFA scheme’s criteria is not such as to call into question that finding, since that submission is not a legally established and undisputed fact.In the event that the present appeal is dismissed, or if the annulment of the contested decision is confirmed at the end of, or following, these proceedings, it cannot be ruled out that the Netherlands authorities will be prompted to allow KFC to benefit from the GFA scheme (see, by analogy, order in Case C‑111/99 P Lech‑Stahlwerke v Commission [2001] ECR I‑727, paragraph 19).", "67.", "In those circumstances, the Commission has not established that KFC’s action before the Court of First Instance was not capable, through its outcome, of procuring an advantage to KFC.", "68.", "Therefore, the Court of First Instance was correct to find that KFC had an interest in bringing proceedings.", "69.", "It follows that the first plea must be rejected.", "The second limb of the fourth plea", "Arguments of the parties", "70.", "By the second limb of the fourth plea, the Commission claims that the Court of First Instance committed an error of law by holding, in paragraphs 125 to 140 of the judgment under appeal, that the fact that KFC may not be able to benefit from the GFA scheme is of no consequence for the application of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations on the ground that it concerns a legal situation governed wholly by national law.", "71.", "However, the issue in the present case is to determine whether Community law required the Commission to authorise the Netherlands tax authority to grant GFA authorisation to KFC in application of that principle.", "72.", "As it is, according to the Commission, that principle does not apply in the present case.", "73.", "In the first place, the Commission had neither provided KFC – of whose existence it was unaware – with a specific assurance that the GFA scheme was compatible with the common market, nor did it give a specific assurance to that effect in respect of KFC.", "74.", "In the second place, KFC is not a prudent and circumspect economic operator within the meaning of the case‑law relating to the principle of protection of legitimate expectations.", "75.", "First, it is necessary, in that regard, to distinguish between the situation of an economic operator which is requesting the renewal of an authorisation which gave it access to an aid scheme previously considered compatible with the common market, as was the case in Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission and that of an undertaking which, like KFC, has never had such authorisation and cannot therefore rely on a legitimate expectation in order to demand that it benefit from a transitional scheme providing for the temporary maintenance of the aid scheme in question.", "76.", "Second, the Commission claims that, even if one accepts that KFC made considerable investments to meet the conditions imposed by Netherlands law in order to benefit from the GFA scheme, it submitted a request to the Netherlands authorities for first GFA authorisation on 27 December 2000, although, following the publication of the resolution on a code of conduct for business taxation, referred to in paragraph 8 of the present judgment, and of the Notice on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation (OJ 1998 C 384, p. 3), all prudent and circumspect economic operators knew, from 1998, that it was likely that the Commission would classify the GFA scheme as a State aid scheme and declare it incompatible with the common market.", "Therefore, the finding in paragraph 135 of the judgment under appeal that ‘on the basis of the decision of 11 July 2001 alone, a prudent and circumspect operator was not in a position to foresee the adoption of the [contested] decision’ is incorrect and that finding alone merits the setting aside of that judgment.", "77.", "Third, the fact that it was possible, after the 11 July 2001 decision, that the Commission would adopt a decision finding that the GFA scheme did not constitute a State aid scheme, does not mean, contrary to what the Court of First Instance held in paragraph 132 of the judgment under appeal, that KFC can properly rely on the principle of protection of legitimate expectations.", "78.", "In the third place, as regards the balancing of interests, the Commission takes the view that KFC’s expectation would, in any event, be of a very general nature and that there is no logical connection between, on the one hand, the finding that the actual beneficiaries of the GFA scheme can rely on the principle of protection of legitimate expectations and, on the other, the Court of First Instance’s finding that there is no overriding Community interest which precludes KFC from effectively relying on that principle.", "79.", "Lastly, the judgment under appeal will encourage, in the future, any operators which have submitted a request for aid before the initiation of the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) EC to bring an action for annulment.", "80.", "KFC contends, first, that the case‑law of the Court does not require that the legitimate expectation to be protected must be based on actual assurances given by a Community institution.", "Thus, it is contradictory on the Commission’s part to accept, as it did in the contested decision, that its decision regarding the BCC scheme gave rise to a legitimate expectation, and to state, as it did in its appeal application, that the decision concerns ‘merely a decision relating to another slightly similar aid scheme’, and not a specific assurance in respect of KFC.", "Furthermore, none of the undertakings covered by the transitional scheme provided for by the contested decision had received such an assurance.", "81.", "Next, as regards whether KFC should be classified as a prudent and circumspect economic operator, KFC contends that there is no reason to classify those beneficiaries of the BCC scheme awaiting a decision relating to their request for renewal of authorisation in the context of that scheme as prudent and circumspect economic operators, while not classifying KFC, which was awaiting a response to its request for first GFA authorisation, in the same way.", "Moreover, as the Court of First Instance stated, the 11 July 2001 decision could not, according to KFC, result in its legitimate expectation – as regards the compatibility of the GFA scheme with the common market – ceasing to exist from that date.", "A fortiori , that legitimate expectation could not have ceased to exist prior to that decision.", "82.", "Lastly, concerning the balancing of interests, the issue of whether KFC’s legitimate expectation is ‘very general in nature’ or otherwise is irrelevant.", "Once a legitimate expectation is established, whatever the means by which the Commission brought it about, the interest of the legal person concerned must be balanced against the Community interest.", "83.", "In any event, the Commission in no way explains how the Community interest precludes the benefit of a transitional scheme being granted to 14 undertakings whose requests for first GFA authorisation were pending on the date of the contested decision.", "Furthermore, neither the scope of the aid granted, or to be granted, nor the number of undertakings which can rely on the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations can affect the application of that principle.", "Lastly, as situations such as those at issue are rare, the judgment under appeal will not, according to KFC, lead to a rush to aid schemes which have not been notified.", "Findings of the Court", "84.", "The Court has repeatedly held that the right to rely on the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations extends to any person in a situation where a Community institution has caused him to entertain expectations which are justified by precise assurances provided to him.", "However, if a prudent and alert economic operator could have foreseen the adoption of a Community measure likely to affect his interests, he cannot plead that principle if the measure is adopted (see, to that effect, Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission , paragraph 147 and the case‑law cited).", "85.", "Furthermore, even if the European Community had first created a situation capable of giving rise to legitimate expectations, an overriding public interest may preclude transitional measures from being adopted in respect of situations which arose before the new rules came into force but which are still subject to change (Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission , paragraph 148 and the case‑law cited).", "86.", "The Court has also held that, in the absence of an overriding public interest, the Commission will have infringed a superior rule of law if it fails to couple the repeal of a set of rules with transitional measures for the protection of the expectations which a trader might legitimately have derived from the Community rules (Belgium and Forum 187 , paragraph 149 and the case‑law cited).", "87.", "In the light of the foregoing, it should be borne in mind, first, that, in points 111 and 112 of the grounds for the contested decision, the Commission itself took the view that the GFA scheme is similar to the BCC scheme and that, having found in its decision of 2 May 1984 on the BCC scheme [Fourteenth Report on Competition Policy (1984) p. 271] that the system on which the BCC was based did not constitute aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the EEC Treaty (subsequently Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty, now Article 87(1) EC), it was accepting the arguments of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the interested third parties concerning the existence of a legitimate expectation on the part of the beneficiaries of the GFA scheme, thus refraining from ordering recovery of the aid granted.", "88.", "It is important to emphasise, however, that KFC was in a different situation to that of those taxpayers who the Commission had accepted, in points 113 to 118 of the grounds for the contested decision, were entitled to have a legitimate expectation, since KFC was not a beneficiary of the GFA scheme but had merely submitted a request for first GFA authorisation.", "89.", "Even if, as KFC claims, the inspector is required to grant GFA authorisation to any taxpayer who makes a request and satisfies the statutory conditions necessary to benefit from it, it is nevertheless true that Netherlands law requires the adoption of a decision by the inspector – after ascertaining that the taxpayer satisfies those statutory conditions – which can itself, moreover, be subject to conditions.", "90.", "In addition, the situation of taxpayers who have submitted a request for first GFA authorisation cannot be properly compared to that of taxpayers who have submitted a request for renewal of authorisation under the BCC scheme, with regard to whom the Court recognised the existence of a legitimate expectation in its judgment in Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission .", "91.", "In that judgment, the Court took account of the significant investments which those undertakings, which were benefiting from authorisation under the BCC scheme and were requesting renewal, had made, and of the long-term commitments which they had undertaken.", "Those who have requested a first GFA authorisation are not, in principle, in the same situation as a taxpayer who is already a beneficiary of the GFA in relation to investments and commitments.", "92.", "It should, in that regard, be pointed out that KFC has never referred specifically to investments already made or to commitments already undertaken.It is clear, on the contrary, from the position it adopted before the Court of First Instance, as summarised in paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘if the Commission had not adopted the contested decision, it [KFC] could have increased, from 2000, its risk reserve before the definitive tax assessment was established.’ Likewise, KFC refers to decisions which it could have adopted in relation to risk reserves and the location of the seat of the financing company.", "93.", "Those various elements show that KFC challenges the fact of not being able to benefit, in the future, from the advantage of GFA authorisation.", "94.", "Such a situation is different from that of beneficiaries of GFA authorisation which, if the transitional measures had not been adopted, would have suffered losses owing to investments made and commitments undertaken in the past, at a time when the legality of the tax scheme in question had not been in doubt.", "95.", "Consequently, by holding, in paragraph 140 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had infringed the principle of protection of legitimate expectations by not allowing KFC to benefit from the transitional scheme provided for by the contested decision, the Court of First Instance erred in law.", "96.", "It follows that the second limb of the fourth plea is well founded.", "The third plea and the first limb of the fourth plea", "97.", "As the second limb of the fourth plea has been upheld, it is not necessary to examine either first limb of the fourth plea, or the third plea.", "Fifth plea", "Arguments of the parties", "98.", "The Commission considers that the Court of First Instance committed an error of law by holding that KFC could rely on the principle of equal treatment.", "It claims, inter alia, that on any view KFC cannot be equated with undertakings benefiting from the GFA scheme which submitted observations in the course of the procedure initiated by the 11 July 2001 decision and for whom the Netherlands authorities requested the establishment of a transitional scheme.", "99.", "KFC takes the view that that plea must be held to be inadmissible to the extent to which it concerns factual issues, and should be rejected as to the remainder.", "In that connection, it points out that, as regards the principle of equal treatment, the only relevant question is whether there are objective differences of such significance as to justify different treatment.", "However, none of the alleged differences put forward by the Commission regarding the respective situations of KFC and undertakings benefiting from GFA authorisation at the time of the 11 July 2001 decision is capable of justifying such a difference in treatment.", "Findings of the Court", "100.", "It is settled case‑law that a breach of the general Community law principle of equal treatment arises through the application of different rules to comparable situations or the application of the same rule to different situations (see, inter alia, Case C‑390/96 Lease Plan [1998] ECR I‑2553, paragraph 34, and Case C‑156/98 Germany v Commission [2000] ECR I‑6857, paragraph 84).", "101.", "In the present case, it is common ground that the Commission treated differently, in the contested decision, those undertakings benefiting from the GFA scheme and those undertakings whose requests for first GFA authorisation were pending on the date of that decision, by granting a transitional scheme to the former and not to the latter.", "102.", "It is clear from paragraphs 87 to 94 of the present judgment that that difference of treatment was justified, as the criterion which established the difference describes objectively different situations regarding those two categories of undertakings.", "103.", "Therefore, by holding, in paragraphs 149 and 150 of the judgment under appeal, that in the contested decision the Commission had infringed the principle of equal treatment by not allowing KFC to benefit from the transitional scheme on the ground that, in so doing, the Commission had treated individuals in a similar situation differently in respect of the legitimate expectation which they could have had in the granting of a reasonable transitional period, the Court of First Instance erred in law.", "104.", "It follows that the fifth plea is well founded.", "105.", "Having regard to all of the foregoing, and without it being necessary to examine the sixth plea, the judgment under appeal must be set aside.", "The action before the Court of First Instance", "106.", "In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, in the event that the decision of the Court of First Instance has been quashed, the Court may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits, or it may refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for judgment.", "107.", "In the present case, while it is clear from paragraphs 84 to 95 of this judgment that the first limb of the first plea submitted by KFC in support of its action against the contested decision is unfounded, it is necessary to examine the second limb of that plea and the second and third pleas submitted in support of its action.", "108.", "The reply, in particular to the third plea, alleging infringement of the duty to give reasons, implies a factual assessment on the basis of information which was not considered by the Court of First Instance.", "109.", "It follows that the state of proceedings does not permit the Court to give final judgment, with the result that it is necessary to refer the matter back to the Court of First Instance for it to rule on the second limb of the first plea, and the second and third pleas.", "Costs", "110.", "As the case is being referred back to the Court of First Instance, it is appropriate to reserve the costs relating to the present appeal proceedings.", "Operative part", "On those grounds, the Court

the Court of First Instance of the European Communities on 1 July 2004 in Case T‑308/00 Salzgitter v Commission [2004] ECR II‑1933 (‘the judgment under appeal’) by which that court partly annulled Commission Decision 2000/797/ECSC of 28 June 2000 on State aid granted by the Federal Republic of Germany to Salzgitter AG, Preussag Stahl AG and the group’s steel-industry subsidiaries, now known as Salzgitter AG - Stahl und Technologie (SAG) (OJ 2000 L 323, p. 5, ‘the contested decision’).", "By its cross-appeal, Salzgitter AG (‘Salzgitter’) seeks to have the judgment under appeal set aside in part.", "Legal context and facts of the case", "2 In paragraphs 1 to 5 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance set out the legal context as follows:", "‘1.", "Article 4 CS provides:", "“The following are recognised as incompatible with the common market for coal and steel and shall accordingly be abolished and prohibited within the Community, as provided in this Treaty:", "…", "(c) subsidies or aids granted by States, or special charges imposed by States, in any form whatsoever.”", "2.", "Article 67 CS provides:", "“1.", "Any action by a Member State which is liable to have appreciable repercussions on conditions of competition in the coal or the steel industry shall be brought to the knowledge of the Commission by the government concerned.", "2.", "If the action is liable, by substantially increasing differences in production costs otherwise than through changes in productivity, to provoke a serious disequilibrium, the Commission, after consulting the Consultative Committee and the Council, may take the following steps:", "– if the action taken by that State is having harmful effects on the coal or steel undertakings within the jurisdiction of that State, the Commission may authorise it to grant aid to these undertakings, the amount, conditions and duration of which shall be determined in agreement with the Commission. …;", "– if the action taken by that State is having harmful effects on the coal or steel undertakings within the jurisdiction of other Member States, the Commission shall make a recommendation to that State with a view to remedying these effects by such measures as that State may consider most compatible with its own economic equilibrium.", "…”", "3.", "The first and second paragraph of Article 95 CS provide as follows:", "“In all cases not provided for in this Treaty where it becomes apparent that a decision or recommendation of the Commission is necessary to attain, within the common market in coal and steel and in accordance with Article 5, one of the objectives of the Community set out in Articles 2, 3 and 4, the decision may be taken or the recommendation made with the unanimous assent of the Council and after the Consultative Committee has been consulted.", "Any decision so taken or recommendation so made shall determine what penalties, if any, may be imposed.”", "4.", "In order to meet the restructuring needs of the steel industry, the Commission relied on the provisions of Article 95 CS to introduce, in the early 1980s, a Community scheme authorising the grant of State aid to the steel industry in specific and limited cases.", "That scheme underwent a series of amendments in order to deal with the cyclical problems encountered by the steel industry.", "The decisions successively adopted for that purpose are commonly known as the “Steel Aid Codes”.", "5.", "On 18 December 1996, the Commission adopted Decision No 2496/96/ECSC establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (OJ 1996 L 338, p. 42), which constitutes the Sixth Steel Aid Code [(the Sixth Steel Aid Code)].", "That decision was applicable from 1 January 1997 to 22 July 2002.’", "3 In paragraphs 6 to 11 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance set out the pre-litigation procedure, in the following terms:", "‘6.", "Salzgitter … is a group operating in the steel sector which includes Preussag Stahl AG and other undertakings involved in the same sector.", "7.", "In Germany, the Zonenrandförderungsgesetz (German law on the development of the border zone between the former German Democratic Republic and the former Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, “the ZRFG”) was adopted on 5 August 1971 and approved, along with subsequent amendments to it, by [decision of] the Commission [(“the 1971 Decision”)], following assessment of the measures planned by the Commission pursuant to Article 92 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 87 EC) and Article 93 of the EC Treaty (now Article 88 EC).", "The most recent amendments to the ZRFG were approved by the Commission as State aid compatible with the EC Treaty (OJ 1993 C 3, p. 3).", "The ZRFG came to an end definitively in 1995.", "8.", "From the beginning, Paragraph 3 of the ZRFG provided for tax incentives in the form of special depreciation allowances (“Sonderabschreibungen”) and tax-free reserves (“steuerfreie Rücklagen”) for investments made in any establishment of an undertaking situated along the border area between the former German Democratic Republic and the former Czechoslovak Socialist Republic … .", "The special depreciation allowances permitted the entry of a higher rate of depreciation for eligible investment in the company accounts than would be possible, under the ordinary legislation, in the initial year or years of the investment of the company in question.", "Thus the company’s tax base was reduced and liquidity was increased for the first year or years of the investment, thereby procuring a gain for the company.", "Tax-free reserves also produced a gain for the company.", "The special depreciation allowances and tax-free reserves could not be cumulated, however.", "9.", "By letter dated 3 March 1999 the Commission, after having observed from a reading of the annual accounts of Preussag Stahl AG, one of the companies of … Salzgitter …, that the company had been subsidised repeatedly between 1986 and 1995 on the basis of Paragraph 3 of the ZRFG, informed Germany of its decision to initiate the procedure under Article 6(5) of the Sixth Steel Aid Code in respect of the aid granted by [the Federal Republic of] Germany to Preussag Stahl AG and to the other subsidiaries of … Salzgitter ….", "By that decision, published on 24 April 1999 in the Official Journal of the European Communities (OJ 1999 C 113, p. 9), the Commission invited the parties concerned to submit their observations on the aid in question.", "10.", "During the administrative procedure, the Commission received comments from the German authorities, by letter of 10 May 1999, and the observations of the only third party concerned, the UK Steel Association, which it forwarded to the Federal Republic of Germany.", "11.", "On 28 June 2000, the Commission adopted [the contested d]ecision, on State aid granted by the Federal Republic of Germany to Salzgitter…, by which the special depreciation allowances and tax-free reserves pursuant to Paragraph 3 of the ZRFG of which [Salzgitter] had been the recipient in respect of eligible bases of DEM 484 million and DEM 367 million respectively were found to be State aid incompatible with the common market.", "By Articles 2 and 3 of the [contested] decision, the Commission ordered the Federal Republic of Germany to recover that aid from the recipient and requested it to state the specific conditions for its recovery.’", "Proceedings before the Court of First Instance and the judgment under appeal", "4 By application lodged at the Registry of the Court of First Instance on 11 September 2000, Salzgitter brought an action seeking the annulment of the contested decision.", "5 By order of the President of the Court of First Instance of 29 March 2001, the Federal Republic of Germany was given leave to intervene in support of the form of order sought by Salzgitter.", "6 In the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance held that the Commission was entitled to apply Article 4(c) CS, and not Article 67 CS, to the State aid granted to Salzgitter.", "7 In reaching that conclusion, the Court of First Instance stated, particularly in paragraphs 111 to 115 of the judgment under appeal, that Articles 4(c) CS and 67 CS cover two distinct areas, with Article 67 not covering State aid, and that the uncertainty brought about by developments in the legal regime governing aid not specific to the coal and steel sectors during the period that saw the successive adoption of the first three Steel Aid Codes could not change its interpretation.", "8 Moreover, the Court of First Instance rejected as unfounded Salzgitter’s arguments concerning the Commission’s erroneous interpretation of the notion of State aid and of Article 95 CS, as well as its argument concerning the failure to state reasons in the contested decision.", "9 By contrast, the Court of First Instance held that the Commission could not order the recovery of the aid paid to the applicant between 1986 and 1995 without breaching the principle of legal certainty, and annulled Articles 2 and 3 of the contested decision concerning the Federal Republic of Germany’s obligation to recover the State aid covered by that decision.", "10 To reach the finding that there was a breach of the principle of legal certainty, the Court of First Instance held, in paragraph 174 of the judgment under appeal, that the situation resulting from the adoption of the Second and the Third Steel Aid Code had created a legal situation that was ambiguous as to the scope of the 1971 Decision and the scope of the obligation to notify the aid granted to Salzgitter after adoption of that third code, pursuant to Article 6 of that code.", "11 Subsequently, the Court of First Instance held, in paragraph 179 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had been aware of the aid paid to Salzgitter under the ZRFG because Salzgitter had sent the Commission its annual reports and accounts for the years 1987/1988.", "12 The Court of First Instance inferred from this, in paragraph 180 of the judgment under appeal, that the situation of uncertainty and lack of clarity, combined with the prolonged lack of reaction on the part of the Commission, in spite of its awareness of the aid received by Salzgitter, had led to the creation by the Commission, in disregard of its duty of diligence, of an equivocal situation which the Commission was under a duty to clarify before it could take any action to order the recovery of the aid already paid.", "Therefore, the Court of First Instance held, in paragraph 182 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission could not order the recovery of the aid paid to Salzgitter between 1986 and 1995 without breaching the principle of legal certainty .", "13 In those circumstances, the Court of First Instance held that it was not necessary to rule on the calculation of the amount of aid covered by the contested decision.", "Forms of order sought by the parties", "14 By its appeal, the Commission asks the Court to set aside the judgment under appeal, to refer the dispute back to the Court of First Instance and to order Salzgitter to pay the costs.", "15 Salzgitter contends that the appeal should be dismissed and, by a cross-appeal, claims that the judgment under appeal should be set aside in so far as it partially dismissed its action for annulment, and that Article 1 of the contested decision, which classifies as ‘State aid’ the special depreciation allowance and the tax-free reserves which Salzgitter enjoyed pursuant to the ZRFG, should be annulled.", "Salzgitter also contends that the Commission should be ordered to pay the costs of both sets of proceedings.", "16 The Federal Republic of Germany contends that the Commission’s appeal should be dismissed, that the judgment under appeal should be set aside in so far as it partially dismissed the action brought by Salzgitter, and that Article 1 of the contested decision should be annulled.", "The cross-appeal", "17 If the Court upholds the cross-appeal brought by Salzgitter, there will be no need to rule on the main appeal, which will become redundant.", "Therefore, the cross-appeal must be examined first.", "The first plea", "18 By its first plea, divided into three limbs, Salzgitter submits that there has been a breach of Articles 4(c) CS and 67 CS.", "The first limb of the first plea", "– Arguments of the parties", "19 By the first limb of the first plea, Salzgitter submits that the Court of First Instance committed an error of law in finding that the Commission was entitled to assess the aid covered by the contested decision under Article 4(c) CS and not Article 67 CS (Joined Cases 27/58 to 29/58 Hauts Fourneaux de Givors and Others v High Authority [1960] ECR 501, 523; Case 30/59 De Gezamenlijke Steenkolenmijnen in Limburg v High Authority [1961] ECR 1, 25; and Case C-390/98 Banks [2001] ECR I‑6117, paragraph 88).", "20 According to Salzgitter, it does not follow from the judgment in Joined Cases 6/69 and 11/69 Commission v France [1960] ECR 523 that aid not specific to the coal and steel sector would already have been prohibited by Article 4(c) CS prior to adoption of the First Steel Aid Code.", "21 The German Government develops arguments that are similar to Salzgitters.", "22 The German Government also contends that the ECSC Treaty only brought about partial integration, confined to the coal and steel industry.", "23 The German Government contends that, taking into account the broad interpretation given to the notion of ‘State aid’ in Article 87 EC, which is also given to the notion of ‘aid’ in Article 4(c) CS (C‑200/97 Ecotrade [1998] ECR I‑7907), applying Article 4(c) CS to aid such as the aid covered by the contested decision would have the effect of divesting Article 67 CS of any effectiveness.", "24 Not applying Article 4(c) CS to aid not exclusively granted to steel undertakings would not weaken the control that the Commission exercises over State aid, since Articles 87 EC, 88 EC and 67 CS apply to such aid.", "Prohibiting that aid would restrict, in a manner that would be illegal, the scope of the exemptions provided for in Article 87(3)(a) to (e) EC.", "25 The German Government also contends that the expression ‘in any form whatsoever’ used in Article 4(c) CS only seeks to distinguish the notion of State aid itself from the manner in which it is granted, and does not permit extending the application of that provision to aid such as that covered by the contested decision.", "26 The German Government maintains that the judgment in Commission v France, cited above, establishes that Article 67 CS applies to aid that is not specific to the coal and steel industry and that that was confirmed by the judgments in Case 59/70 Netherlands v Commission [1971] ECR 639 and in Banks.", "27 The German Government argues that the Federal Republic of Germany satisfied its notification obligations by notifying the ZRFG to the Commission pursuant to Articles 87 and 88 EC, and stresses that that Member State was not under an obligation to inform the Commission under Article 67(1) CS, since the ZRFG was not liable to have appreciable repercussions on conditions of competition in the coal or steel industry within the meaning of Article 67(1) CS.", "28 For its part, the Commission submits that the case-law cited by Salzgitter provides, in actual fact, that Article 67 CS does not apply to State aid, but only to general measures which Member States may adopt as part of their economic or social policy, or to sectoral measures which do not relate specifically to the steel or coal industry.", "According to the Commission, by contrast, Article 4(c) CS applies to aid even where it is of a general nature (see, in particular, De Gezamenlijke Steenkolenmijnen in Limburg v High Authority).", "29 The Commission submits that the German Government wrongly interpreted the case-law by failing to distinguish between general measures and State aid schemes of general application, and that the Court has never referred, in the case-law cited, to general aid schemes.", "30 The Commission submits that, in any event, even if Article 67 CS did apply in the present case, the Federal Republic of Germany did not inform it, in accordance with Article 67(1) CS, of its intention to apply the ZRFG to undertakings in the steel industry, and that that Member State could not rely on an authorisation, even implicit, for the aid covered by the contested decision based on that provision.", "– Findings of the Court", "31 It must be held, first, that while Article 4(c) CS prohibits the granting of State aid to steel and coal undertakings, without drawing a distinction between individual aid or aid disbursed under a State aid scheme, Article 67 CS refers expressly to State aid only in respect of protective measures that the Commission may authorise, pursuant to the first indent of paragraph 2 of that article, in favour of coal or steel undertakings where they suffer competitive disadvantages because of general economic policy measures.", "32 Also, it is clear from consistent case-law that Articles 4 CS and 67 CS concern two distinct areas, the first abolishing and prohibiting certain actions by Member States in the field which the ECSC Treaty places under Community jurisdiction, the second intended to prevent the distortion of competition which exercise of the residual powers of the Member States inevitably entails (see Banks, paragraph 88, and the case-law cited there).", "The Court deduces from this that Article 67 CS covers general measures which Member States may adopt in the context of their economic and social policy and measures taken by Member States which apply to industries other than coal and steel but which are capable of having significant repercussions on the conditions of competition in those industries (see Banks, paragraph 88).", "33 The Court has also held that action taken under Article 67 CS cannot be what, in any other form whatsoever, Article 4 CS declares to be incompatible with the common market for coal and steel and abolished and prohibited (De Gezamenlijke Steenkolenmijnen in Limburg v High Authority, p. 22).", "The Court has held, in particular, that it is inconceivable that the authors of the ECSC Treaty decided in Article 4(c) CS that subsidies and aids granted by Member States in any form whatsoever should be abolished and prohibited and then declared in Article 67 CS that, without even having been authorised by the Commission, that aid could be allowed subject to the measures recommended by the Commission to mitigate or remedy its effects (De Gezamenlijke Steenkolenmijnen in Limburg v High Authority, p. 21).", "34 The Court has also held that the first indent of Article 67(2) CS, which, by derogation from Article 4 CS, allows the granting of State aid in respect of protective measures to undertakings referred to in Article 80 CS, does not distinguish between aid specific to the coal and steel industry and aid which applies to it as the result of a general measure (Commission v France, paragraph 43).", "The Court accordingly held that a preferential rediscount rate for exports constitutes aid which, in the case in point, had to be authorised by the Commission under Article 67(2) CS in so far as it concerned the industry covered by the ECSC Treaty (see Commission v France, paragraph 44).", "35 Finally, State aid granted to an undertaking falling within the scope of the ECSC Treaty has identical anti-competitive effects, regardless of whether it constitutes individual aid or aid granted under a State aid scheme that is not specific to the coal and steel sector.", "36 In the light of the foregoing, it must consequently be held that Article 4(c) CS applies to State aid paid to coal and steel undertakings under a State aid scheme that is not specific to the coal and steel sector.", "37 Contrary to what the German Government claims, that interpretation does not undermine the effectiveness of Article 67 CS.", "General policy measures are liable to have appreciable repercussions on conditions of competition in the coal or steel industry within the meaning of Article 67(1) CS, without constituting State aid.", "38 In the present case, it is not contested that Salzgitter is an undertaking that falls within the scope of the ECSC Treaty and that the aid covered by the contested decision does not constitute protective measures falling within the scope of the first indent of Article 67(2) CS.", "39 It follows that the Court of First Instance did not commit an error of law in finding that the Commission was entitled to hold that Article 4(c) CS, and not Article 67 CS, applied to the aid covered by the contested decision.", "40 Accordingly the first limb of the first plea cannot succeed and must be rejected.", "The second limb of the first plea", "– Arguments of the parties", "41 By the second limb of the first plea, Salzgitter submits that the Court of First Instance committed an error of law in finding that the Commission was entitled to apply Article 4(c) CS, and not Article 67 CS, to the aid covered by the contested decision, in so far as the Commission was not competent, under a Steel Aid Code, to extend the scope of Article 4(c) CS.", "42 Salzgitter submits that the first and second paragraphs of Article 95 CS do not provide a sufficient legal basis for such an amendment of the ECSC Treaty and that the procedure under Article 96 CS, in its previous version, should have been complied with, or at least the procedure for a ‘minor amendment’ provided for in the third and fourth paragraphs of Article 95 CS (Opinion 1/59 of 17 December 1959, ECR 1959, p. 533).", "43 The Commission states that there has been no revision of the ECSC Treaty, the wording of Article 4(c) CS having remained unchanged since 23 July 1952.", "– Findings of the Court", "44  In light of the response to the first limb of the first plea, it must be held that the second limb of that plea is unfounded, on the same grounds as those set out in relation to that first limb,   and that the second limb must therefore be rejected.", "The third limb of the first plea", "– Arguments of the parties", "45 By the third limb of the first plea, Salzgitter submits that, in paragraphs 112 et seq. of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance presented the Commission’s decision-making practice in an incorrect manner.", "Salzgitter submits that it was on the entry into force of the ECSC Treaty in 1952, not in the early 1970s when the Commission formed the view that Article 4(c) CS applied only to aid specific to the coal and steel sector (see, to that effect, the report published by the High Authority of the ECSC in 1963, entitled ‘Le Traité CECA de 1952 à 1962’).", "Salzgitter also submits that, as regards the interpretation of Articles 4(c) CS and 67 CS, the Commission has acted differently depending on whether aid is paid to coal undertakings or steel undertakings.", "46 The Commission contends that the fact that it held a different view prior to the adoption of the Third Steel Aid Code has no bearing on the aid granted to Salzgitter, as that view was not recorded in any individual act addressed to Salzgitter capable of becoming final before 1 January 1986, the date on which that third code came into force.", "– Findings of the Court", "47 It must be held that the analysis of the Commission’s decision-making practice with regard to aid granted to undertakings that fall under the ECSC Treaty cannot affect the interpretation by the Court of First Instance of Articles 4(c) CS and 67 CS.", "48 Consequently, the third limb of the first plea in law must be rejected as ineffective.", "49 The first plea must therefore be rejected in its entirety.", "The second plea", "– Arguments of the parties", "50 By its second plea, Salzgitter submits that the Court of First Instance infringed the fourth indent of Article 5 CS and the first paragraph of Article 15 CS, by rejecting the plea alleging a failure to state the reasons on which the contested decision was based.", "51 Salzgitter submits that the Commission failed to explain the development of its understanding of the law in terms of the scope of Article 4(c) CS and Article 67 CS respectively and the reason why, in the present case, its assessment departed from its decision-making practice in the coal sector or in comparable cases.", "52 The German Government submits that, because of the development of the Commission’s understanding of the law in relation to Article 4(c) CS, a more detailed statement of the reasons for the contested decision was required.", "53 The Commission contends that its practice changed with the enactment of the Third Steel Aid Code, which adequately states the reasons for that change.", "The Commission refers, in particular, to the third and fourth paragraph of point I in the grounds of the third code.", "The Commission denies that there is a particular obligation to state reasons, contending that its obligation to provide relevant information is dictated solely by the first paragraph of Article 95 CS and the third paragraph of Article 15 CS.", "– Findings of the Court", "54 Salzgitter submits that the Court of First Instance committed an error of law in finding that the plea alleging a failure to state reasons in the contested decision was unfounded and had to be dismissed.", "55 That is a question of law subject to review by the Court of Justice on an appeal (C‑166/95 P Commission v Daffix [1997] ECR I‑983).", "56 According to settled case-law relating to Article 253 EC, which can be applied to Article 15 CS, the statement of reasons required for an act with adverse effects must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted the measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the Court to carry out its review.", "It is not necessary for the reasoning to go into all the relevant facts and points of law, since the question whether the statement of reasons meets the requirements of Article 253 EC must be assessed with regard not only to its wording but also to its context and to all the legal rules governing the matter in question (see C‑501/00 Spain v Commission [2004] ECR I‑6717, paragraph 73, and the case-law cited).", "57 In paragraph 184 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance held that its review of Salzgitter’s first three pleas showed sufficiently that the obligation to state reasons was complied with in the contested decision.", "58 The Commission’s analysis justifying the application of Article 4(c) CS to the aid at issue is set out clearly and unambiguously in paragraph 66 of the contested decision.", "In paragraphs 67 to 76 and 126 to 133 of that decision, the Commission provides, inter alia, a detailed account of the specific rules laid down by the Steel Aid Codes in force since 1986.", "59 Consequently, the Court of First Instance did not commit an error of law in finding that the contested decision complied with the obligation to state reasons.", "60 Therefore, the second plea of the cross-appeal, alleging a failure to state the reasons on which the contested decision was based, is unfounded and must be rejected.", "61 Accordingly, the cross-appeal must be dismissed.", "The main appeal", "62 By its first plea, divided into six limbs, the Commission submits that there has been an infringement of Article 4(c) CS and the Third, Fourth and Sixth Steel Aid Codes.", "By its second plea, the Commission submits that there has been an infringement of its right to be heard.", "The second plea", "– Arguments of the parties", "63 By its second plea, which should be examined first since it challenges the formal validity of the judgment under appeal, the Commission submits that the Court of First Instance infringed the rights of the defence in finding that the successive adoption of the first three Steel Aid Codes had created a legal situation that was ambiguous, without giving the Commission the opportunity to present its arguments on this point.", "64 The Commission submits that the questions which the Court of First Instance submitted to it by letter of 28 July 2003 did not provide any indication that it could be accused of having failed to provide legal clarity.", "65 Salzgitter contends that the lack of legal clarity resulting from the successive adoption of the first three Steel Aid Codes was mentioned in paragraph 114 of its application, therefore giving the Commission the opportunity to submit its arguments on that point.", "66 Salzgitter also contends that the Court of First Instance did not breach the audi alteram partem principle, since it relied on the facts as presented by Salzgitter in its written pleadings, by which Salzgitter intended to show that the principle of legal certainty had been infringed (C-110/03 Belgium v Commission [2005] ECR I-2801, paragraph 27).", "– Findings of the Court", "67 In the present case, it is apparent from the documents before the Court, and, more specifically, the answers submitted in response to the written questions formulated by the Court of First Instance in its letter of 28 July 2003, that the Commission had the opportunity to describe the development of the rules applying to aid paid to steel undertakings under a general aid scheme in the light of the successive adoption of the first three Steel Aid Codes and to express a view on the legal effect under the ECSC Treaty of an authorising decision adopted pursuant to Article 88 EC.", "In this context, the Commission also stated that Article 6 of the Third Steel Aid Code laid down an obligation to notify aid paid to Salzgitter under the ZRFG.", "68 In those circumstances, the Commission’s claim that the Court of First Instance did not give it an opportunity to discuss this question must be dismissed.", "69 Therefore, the Commission’s second plea must be rejected as unfounded.", "The first plea", "70 By its first plea, the Commission calls into question the analysis carried out by the Court of First Instance with regard to a breach of the principle of legal certainty, in two respects.", "The Commission submits, first, that the rules applying to the aid in question were perfectly clear and, second, that it did not react late in respect of that aid.", "According to the Commission, if follows from this that the Court of First Instance’s analysis of the overall situation, which it relied on to annul the part of the contested decision ordering recovery of that aid, contains an error of law.", "71 The Commission also submits that the Court of First Instance committed an error of law in accepting that the recipient of aid can rely on a breach of the principle of legal certainty.", "Clarity of the legal regime applying to the aid in issue", "– Arguments of the parties", "72 The Commission submits that the Court of First Instance committed an error of law in finding that the legal situation resulting from the simultaneous application of the ECSC Treaty, the EC Treaty and the various Steel Aid Codes was uncertain and lacked clarity.", "73 First of all, the Commission takes issue with the conclusion reached by the Court of First Instance that adoption of the Second and the Third Steel Aid Code led to withdrawal of the authorisation of the ZRFG which the Commission granted by the 1971 Decision.", "74 The Commission submits that the authorisation granted by that decision, which was adopted on the basis of the EEC Treaty, could have no effect under the ECSC Treaty, and that aid to steel undertakings provided for under the ZRFG was prohibited before publication of the First Steel Aid Code (Commission v France, paragraphs 41 to 44).", "The Commission submits that the authorisation contained in the 1971 Decision and the authorisations which followed only became applicable to steel undertakings by reason of that code and that that general authorisation, which was temporary, expired on 31 December 1981, the date that code expired (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-74/00 P and C‑75/00 P Falck and Acciaierie di Bolzano v Commission [2002] ECR I‑7869, paragraphs 115 and 116).", "75 The Commission also submits that Article 67 CS does not apply to State aid and that Article 4(c) CS prohibits aid ‘in any form whatsoever’.", "The Commission also submits that the Federal Republic of Germany did not inform it of the aid paid to Salzgitter and that that Member State cannot therefore claim that the Commission authorised that aid on the basis of Article 67 CS.", "76 The Commission also contests the conclusion reached by the Court of First Instance that adoption of the Second and the Third Steel Aid Code created greater ambiguity, resulting from uncertainty over the application of Article 6 of that third code – which lays down an obligation to notify State aid – to aid paid to undertakings in the steel sector under the ZRFG, because that aid scheme had already been authorised under the EC Treaty.", "77 The Commission submits that Article 6 of the Third Steel Aid Code provides – unambiguously – that there is an obligation to notify aid schemes already authorised by the Commission under the EC Treaty if they are to be applied to steel undertakings, and that the distinction between new aid and existing aid is irrelevant for the purposes of the ECSC Treaty, which provides for the immediate abolition of all State aid without exception.", "78 Salzgitter contends that the Court of First Instance has not committed an error of law and that the Commission should have announced in the Second and the Third Steel Aid Code, or in some other communication, that it had changed its interpretation of Article 4(c) CS (Case C‑181/02 P Commission v Kvaerner Warnow Werft [2004] ECR I‑5703, paragraph 41).", "Salzgitter contends, in particular, that the fact that the Commission repeatedly authorised the ZRFG on the basis of the EC Treaty gave rise to a legitimate expectation that the legislation was legal.", "79 Salzgitter contends that Article 4(c) CS does not apply to general measures adopted by Member States in relation to all sectors of the economy, such as the ZRFG, a fact confirmed by the Commission in the first recital to the First and Second Steel Aid Code.", "Salzgitter contends that the Commission applied Article 4(c) CS retroactively, which is contrary to Community law, and conflicts with its long-term investment decisions (see, to that effect, Falck and Acciaierie di Bolzano v Commission, paragraph 119), and that the fact that it is the Commission’s decision-making practice in the coal sector to apply Article 67 CS to non-specific aid in that sector confirms that analysis.", "80 Salzgitter argues that, contrary to the Commission’s claims, it was not clear from Article 6 of the Third Steel Aid Code whether the application of the tax rules in the ZRFG to steel undertakings was from then on to be the subject of a notification under the ECSC Treaty, despite the authorisation previously granted by the Commission under the EC Treaty for the ZRFG as an aid scheme.", "81 Salzgitter contends that application of the ZRFG to steel undertakings did not, in any event, constitute a ‘plan’ to ‘grant or alter aid’ within the meaning of that article, since aid was granted to border regions under the ZRFG long before the Third Steel Aid Code came into force.", "82 Salzgitter also contends that Article 6 of the Third Steel Aid Code did not apply to aid granted while the ZRFG remained in force because that aid, granted under an authorised aid scheme, constituted existing aid (C-47/91 Italy v Commission [1994] ECR I‑4635).", "83 Salzgitter contends that, by notifying the ZRFG to the Commission in 1971 under the EEC Treaty, the Federal Republic of Germany had, in any event, also brought it to the knowledge of the Commission in accordance with Article 67 CS and that, by authorising the tax measures notified under the EC Treaty, the Commission implicitly declared that the measure at issue did not have any ‘appreciable repercussions on conditions of competition’ in the coal or the steel industry within the meaning of Article 67(1) CS.", "84 In essence, the German Government puts forward the same arguments as Salzgitter.", "– Findings of the Court", "85 As a preliminary point, it must be recalled – as held earlier in paragraph 39 of the present judgment – that the Court of First Instance did not commit an error of law in finding that the aid covered by the contested decision fell within the scope of the prohibition laid down in Article 4(c) CS.", "86 Consequently, the Federal Republic of Germany cannot rely on an implicit authorisation of the aid allegedly granted by the Commission on the basis of Article 67 CS.", "87 As regards the reasoning of the Court of First Instance that the adoption of the Second and the Third Steel Aid Code constituted a partial withdrawal by the Commission of the 1971 decision not to object to the application of the ZRFG which led to uncertainty as to the legal regime concerning the ZRFG, it must be held that Article 305(1) EC states that ‘the provisions of the … [EC] Treaty shall not affect the provisions of the [ECSC] Treaty, in particular as regards the rights and obligations of Member States, the powers of the institutions of that Community and the rules laid down by that Treaty for the functioning of the common market in coal and steel.’", "88 It follows from this that the EC Treaty and the ECSC Treaty are independent treaties and that, consequently, the EC Treaty and the secondary legislation enacted on the basis of it cannot produce effects in areas that fall within the scope of the ECSC Treaty (see, to that effect, Joined Cases 188/80 to 190/80 France and Others v Commission [1982] ECR 2545, paragraph 31).", "The provisions of the EC Treaty only apply in the alternative, in situations in which there is no specific rule under the ECSC Treaty (see, in particular, Case 328/85 Deutsche Babcock [1987] ECR 5119, paragraphs 6 to 14).", "89 Consequently, given that Article 1 of the Third Steel Aid Code prohibited both aid that was and aid that was not specific to the steel sector, the Commission could not implicitly withdraw the 1971 Decision.", "90 As regards the Court of First Instance’s finding that the adoption of the Second and the Third Steel Aid Code led to ambiguity as to whether subsequent application of the ZRFG had to be notified as a ‘plan’ within the meaning of Article 6 of that third code, it must, first, be held that that article expressly provides that there is an obligation to inform the Commission of plans to grant aid to the steel industry under schemes on which it has already taken a decision under the EC Treaty.", "91 Moreover, in contrast to the EC Treaty, the ECSC Treaty does not distinguish between new aid and existing aid.", "Article 4(c) CS prohibits, purely and simply, aid granted by Member States in any form whatsoever.", "92 The Court has also held that the compatibility of aid with the common market can be assessed, in the context of the Steel Aid Codes, only in the light of the rules in force on the date on which it is actually paid (Falck and Acciaierie di Bolzano v Commission, paragraph 117).", "93 It follows, as the Commission submits, that Article 6 of the Third Steel Aid Code provided clearly and unequivocally that there was an obligation to notify to the Commission aid that might be granted to Salzgitter under the ZRFG as soon as that code came into force.", "94 Consequently, the Court of First Instance committed an error of law in holding, first, that the adoption of the Third Steel Aid Code led, implicitly, to a partial withdrawal of the authorisation of the ZRFG granted by the 1971 Decision and, second, that Article 6 of that code did not make it possible to determine clearly whether application of the ZRFG after adoption of that code was covered by the obligation to notify ‘plans’ laid down in that article.", "The Commission’s late reaction", "– Arguments of the parties", "95 The Commission contests that it had knowledge, prior to the start of 1998, of Salzgitter receiving aid under the ZRFG and, therefore, that it had been slow to react.", "96 The Commission submits that undertakings to which aid has been granted cannot entertain a legitimate expectation that the aid is lawful unless it has been notified and a diligent businessman is normally able to determine whether that procedure has been followed (C-24/95 Alcan Deutschland [1997] ECR I‑1591, paragraph 25).", "Moreover, the approach adopted by the Court of First Instance undermines legal certainty and favours beneficiaries of illegal aid.", "97 Salzgitter and the German Government contend that the situation in the case that led to the judgment in Alcan Deutschland is different, because the question here is not whether a diligent business man was fully entitled to rely on the legality of measures taken by a national authority, but to determine whether or not the Commission acted in sufficient time.", "– Findings of the Court", "98 In annulling the part of the contested decision relating to the Federal Republic of Germany’s obligation to recover the aid received by Salzgitter, the Court of First Instance again held that the Commission had known of that aid since the end of 1988 and that, given that it did not react until 1998, it had, in taking that decision, breached the principle of legal certainty. 99 It must be held that the reasoning followed by the judgment under appeal as regards breaching the principle of legal certainty is incorrect, and there is no need to rule on whether the Court of First Instance was entitled to hold that the Commission had knowledge of the aid in issue since the end of 1988, which the latter disputes.", "100 Admittedly, the Court has held that, even if the Community legislature has not laid down any period of limitation, the fundamental requirement of legal certainty has the effect of preventing the Commission from indefinitely delaying the exercise of its powers (see, to that effect, 52/69 Geigy v Commission [1972] ECR 787, paragraph 21, and, as regards State aid falling within the scope of the ECSC Treaty, Falck and Acciaierie di Bolzano v Commission, paragraphs 140 and 141).", "101 In this respect, it must be held that, as regards State aid falling within the scope of the EC Treaty, Article 10(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1) provides that, where the Commission has in its possession information from whatever source regarding alleged unlawful aid, it is to examine that information without delay.", "102 Moreover, Article 15 of Regulation No 659/1999 provides that recovery of illegal aid is subject to a limitation period of 10 years, beginning on the day it is granted.", "As stated in recital 14 of the preamble to that regulation, this limitation period has been established for reasons of legal certainty.", "103 Even though it is true that, for the purposes of the ECSC Treaty, those rules do not apply as such, they were based, in the domain of State aid, on the fundamental requirement of legal certainty.", "It follows that, even in a situation in which the Community legislature has not expressly laid down any period of limitation, the Commission cannot indefinitely delay the exercise of its power.", "104 However, it must not be forgotten that the notification of State aid is a central element of Community rules for supervising that aid and that undertakings to which such aid has been granted may not entertain a legitimate expectation that the aid is lawful if it has not been granted in compliance with that procedure (Alcan Deutschland, paragraph 25).", "105 It must also be taken into consideration that the particularly strict nature of the State aid regime under the ECSC Treaty sets it apart from the State aid regime under the EC Treaty (see, in this respect, Falck and Acciaierie di Bolzano v Commission, paragraphs 101 and 102).", "106 It follows from the above that, where aid was granted under the ECSC Treaty without having been notified, a delay by the Commission in exercising its supervisory powers and ordering recovery of the aid does not render that recovery decision unlawful, except in exceptional cases which show that the Commission manifestly failed to act and clearly breached its duty of diligence.", "107 Consequently, even though the Court of First Instance was entitled to hold that a beneficiary of State aid can rely on the principle of legal certainty to support an action for annulment of a decision ordering recovery of that aid, it wrongly applied this principle in the case before it when it failed to examine whether the Commission had manifestly failed to act and clearly breached its duty of diligence in the exercise of its supervisory powers, the sole grounds which, in exceptional cases, can render illegal a Commission decision ordering recovery, under the ECSC Treaty, of non-notified aid.", "108 It follows from the above that the main appeal must be upheld and that the judgment under appeal must be set aside to the extent that it annuls Articles 2 and 3 of the contested decision.", "Referral of the case to the Court of First Instance", "109 It follows from the present judgment that the Court of First Instance rightly held in the judgment under appeal that, for the purposes of the ECSC Treaty, Salzgitter received illegal aid, but that, on the other hand, that judgment is vitiated by an error of law in so far as it annuls the part of the contested decision ordering recovery of the aid in question.", "110 Therefore, the Court of First Instance must rule on the question whether, in the circumstances of the present case, the Commission manifestly failed to act and breached its duty of diligence and, if necessary, examine the other pleas which, quite lawfully, it declined to rule on since it had already annulled Articles 2 and 3 of the contested decision, and which alleged, respectively, that the Commission wrongly considered certain investments as falling under the ECSC Treaty, that part of the aid at issue should have been regarded as aid for environmental protection and that the decisive discount rate selected was wrong.", "111 Those different aspects of the case require examination of complex questions of fact based on elements which the Court of First Instance did not assess and which were not discussed before the Court of Justice, so that, as regards those points, the case cannot be decided.", "112 Therefore, the case has to be referred back to the Court of First Instance.", "On those

November 2018, Prosegur Compañía de Seguridad v Commission (T‑406/11, not published, EU:T:2018:793; ‘the judgment under appeal’), by which the General Court dismissed its action for annulment of

(ex NN 51/07, ex CP 9/07) implemented by Spain (OJ 2011 L 135, p. 1; ‘the decision at issue’).", "I.", "Background to the dispute", "2        The background to the dispute, which was set out by the General Court in paragraphs 1 to 12 of the judgment under appeal, may be summarised as follows.", "3        On 10 October 2007, after a number of written questions had been sent to it in 2005 and 2006 by Members of the European Parliament and after a private operator had submitted a complaint to it in 2007, the European Commission decided to initiate the formal investigation procedure, under Article 108(2) TFEU; that procedure concerned the arrangement provided for in Article 12(5) of the Ley del Impuesto sobre Sociedades (‘the Corporate Tax Law’) as inserted by Ley 24/2001, de Medidas Fiscales, Administrativas y del Orden Social (Law No 24/2001 on fiscal, administrative and social measures), of 27 December 2001 (BOE No 313 of 31 December 2001, p. 50493), and reproduced in Real Decreto Legislativo 4/2004, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley del Impuesto sobre Sociedades (Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004 approving the recast text of the Corporate Tax Law), of 5 March 2004 (BOE No 61 of 11 March 2004, p. 10951; ‘the measure at issue’).", "4        The measure at issue provides that should an undertaking which is taxable in Spain acquire a shareholding in a ‘foreign company’, where that shareholding acquisition is at least 5% and the shareholding at issue is held without interruption for at least one year, the financial goodwill resulting from that shareholding may be deducted, in the form of an amortisation, from the basis of assessment for the corporate tax for which the undertaking is liable.", "The measure at issue specifies that, in order to be classified as a ‘foreign company’, a company must be subject to an identical tax to the tax applicable in Spain and its income must derive mainly from business activities carried out abroad.", "5        The Commission terminated the procedure, as regards shareholding acquisitions within the European Union, by its Decision 2011/5/EC of 28 October 2009 on the tax amortisation of financial goodwill for foreign shareholding acquisitions C 45/07 (ex NN 51/07, ex CP 9/07) implemented by Spain (OJ 2011 L 7, p. 48) (‘the decision of 28 October 2009’).", "6        By that decision, the Commission declared that the measure at issue, which constitutes a tax advantage enabling Spanish companies to amortise the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of shareholdings in non-resident companies, was incompatible with the internal market where it applied to the acquisition of shareholdings in companies established within the European Union.", "7        However, the Commission kept the procedure open as regards shareholding acquisitions outside the European Union, with the Spanish authorities having given an undertaking that they would provide additional details concerning the obstacles to cross-border mergers outside the European Union which they had mentioned.", "8        On 12 January 2011, the Commission adopted the decision at issue.", "By that decision, which was the subject of corrigenda on 3 March and 26 November 2011, the Commission, inter alia, declared that the measure at issue was incompatible with the internal market where it applies to the acquisition of shareholdings in undertakings established outside the European Union (Article 1(1) of the decision at issue) and ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid granted (Article 4 of that decision).", "II.", "The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal", "9        By application lodged at the General Court Registry on 29 July 2011, the appellant brought an action for annulment of Article 1(1) and, in the alternative, of Article 4 of the decision at issue.", "10      The proceedings were stayed from 13 March until 7 November 2014, the date on which the General Court ruled in the case giving rise to the judgment in Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938) and annulled the decision at issue.", "The proceedings were again stayed from 9 March 2015 until 21 December 2016, the date on which the Court of Justice ruled in the cases giving rise to the judgment in Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others (C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981; ‘the judgment in WDFG’).", "11      By the judgment in WDFG, the Court of Justice set aside the judgments of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939), and of 7 November 2014, Banco Santander and Santusa v Commission (T‑399/11, EU:T:2014:938), referred the cases back to the General Court, reserved the costs in part and ordered the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland and the Kingdom of Spain to bear their own costs.", "12      By decision of the President of the Ninth Chamber, Extended Composition, of the General Court of 8 December 2017, the parties having been heard, Cases T‑405/11, Axa Mediterranean v Commission, T‑227/10, Banco Santander v Commission, and T‑406/11, Prosegur Compañia de Seguridad v Commission, were joined for the purposes of the oral part of the procedure, in accordance with Article 68 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court.", "13      By the judgment under appeal, the General Court dismissed the action brought by the appellant.", "14      In rejecting the appellant’s three pleas in law, alleging, first, that the measure at issue was not selective (paragraphs 25 to 221 of the judgment under appeal), secondly, that there had been an error in determining the beneficiary of the measure at issue (paragraphs 222 to 243 of the judgment under appeal) and, thirdly, that the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations had been infringed (paragraphs 244 to 338 of the judgment under appeal), the General Court held that the action had to be dismissed in its entirety.", "15      As regards, more specifically, the first plea in law, the General Court pointed out, in the first place, that, as is apparent from the judgment in WDFG, a tax measure which grants an advantage upon satisfaction of the condition that an economic transaction is performed, may be selective including where, having regard to the characteristics of the transaction concerned, any undertaking may freely choose whether to perform that transaction (paragraphs 67 to 79 of the judgment under appeal).", "16      In the second place, the General Court examined the measure at issue in the light of the three stages of the method of analysing the selectivity of a national tax measure, set out in paragraphs 50 and 51 of the judgment under appeal, that is to say: first of all, the identification of the common or ‘normal’ tax regime applicable in the Member State concerned, next, the assessment of whether the tax measure at issue derogates from that common regime, in so far as it differentiates between operators which are, in the light of the objective pursued by the common regime, in a comparable factual and legal situation and, lastly, the assessment of whether such a derogation is justified by the nature and general scheme of that regime.", "17      As regards the first stage, the General Court stated that the reference framework defined in the decision at issue, namely the ‘tax treatment of goodwill’ (paragraph 82 of the judgment under appeal), was the relevant reference system in the present case, in particular since undertakings which acquire shareholdings in non-resident companies are, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax treatment of goodwill, in a comparable legal and factual situation to that of undertakings which acquire shareholdings in resident companies.", "According to the General Court, the objective of that regime is to ensure a certain parallelism between the accounting treatment and tax treatment of the goodwill resulting for an undertaking from the acquisition of shareholdings in a company (paragraphs 106 to 112 of the judgment under appeal).", "The General Court thus rejected the idea that the measure at issue constitutes an autonomous reference system (paragraphs 116 to 130 of the judgment under appeal), with the result that it rejected the complaint alleging the existence of obstacles to cross-border combinations (paragraphs 111, 128 and 131 of the judgment under appeal).", "18      As regards the second stage, the General Court held that the Commission was fully entitled to find, in the decision at issue, that the measure at issue had introduced a derogation from the normal regime.", "It thus rejected the complaint that the Commission had failed to fulfil its obligation to demonstrate that the acquisition of shareholdings in resident companies and those in non-resident companies were comparable in the light of the objective of fiscal neutrality pursued by the measure at issue (paragraphs 132 to 154 of the judgment under appeal).", "19      As regards the third stage, the General Court pointed out that none of the arguments specifically advanced in the present case justified the derogation introduced by the measure at issue and thus the difference in treatment found (paragraphs 155 to 220 of the judgment under appeal).", "III.", "Forms of order sought", "20      By its appeal, the appellant claims that the Court should:", "–        set aside the judgment under appeal;", "–        uphold its action for annulment and annul the decision at issue definitively; and", "–        order the Commission to pay the costs.", "21      The Commission contends that the Court should:", "–        dismiss the appeal; and", "–        order the appellant to pay the costs.", "IV.", "The appeal", "22      In support of its appeal, the appellant relies on a single ground of appeal, alleging an infringement of Article 107(1) TFEU as regards the condition relating to selectivity.", "It complains, in essence, that the General Court made a number of errors of law in applying the three-stage method of analysing the selectivity of tax measures, as enshrined in the settled case-law of the Court of Justice.", "23      As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, classification of a national measure as ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, requires all the following conditions to be fulfilled.", "First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources.", "Secondly, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between the Member States.", "Thirdly, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient.", "Fourthly, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (the judgment in WDFG, paragraph 53 and the case-law cited, and judgment of 16 March 2021, Commission v Poland, C‑562/19 P, EU:C:2021:201, paragraph 27).", "24      It is well established that national measures that confer a tax advantage which, although not involving a transfer of State resources, place the recipients in a more favourable financial position than other taxpayers are capable of procuring a selective advantage for the recipients and, consequently, of constituting State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU (see, to that effect, the judgment in WDFG, paragraph 56, and judgment of 19 December 2018, A-Brauerei, C‑374/17, EU:C:2018:1024, paragraph 21).", "25      So far as concerns the condition relating to the selectivity of the advantage – inherent in the concept of a ‘State aid’ measure within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, and which alone is the subject of the arguments put forward in the present appeal – it follows from the settled case-law of the Court that that condition requires a determination as to whether, under a particular legal regime, the national measure at issue is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over other undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation and which accordingly suffer different treatment that can, in essence, be classified as discriminatory (judgment of 16 March 2021, Commission v Poland, C‑562/19 P, EU:C:2021:201, paragraph 28 and the case-law cited).", "26      The examination of whether such a measure is selective is thus, in essence, coextensive with the examination of whether it applies to a set of economic operators in a non-discriminatory manner (judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraph 53).", "27      Where the measure at issue is conceived as an aid scheme and not as individual aid, it is for the Commission to establish that that measure, although it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or certain sectors of activity (the judgment in WDFG, paragraph 55 and the case-law cited).", "28      In order to classify a national tax measure as ‘selective’, the Commission must begin by identifying the reference system, that is the ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, and thereafter demonstrate that the tax measure at issue is a derogation from that reference system, in so far as it differentiates between operators who, in the light of the objective pursued by that system, are in a comparable factual and legal situation (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 December 2018, A-Brauerei, C‑374/17, EU:C:2018:1024, paragraph 36 and the case-law cited).", "29      The concept of ‘State aid’ does not, however, cover measures that differentiate between undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by the legal regime concerned, are in a comparable factual and legal situation, and are, therefore, a priori selective, where the Member State concerned is able to demonstrate that that differentiation is justified, in the sense that it flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which those measures form part (judgment of 19 December 2018, A-Brauerei, C‑374/17, EU:C:2018:1024, paragraph 44 and the case-law cited).", "30      The different parts of the single ground of appeal must be examined in the light of those considerations.", "31      The single ground of appeal raised by the appellant is divided into six parts, which essentially concern: (i) the definition of the reference system; (ii) the determination of that system’s objective in the light of which the comparison must be carried out at the second stage of the analysis of selectivity; (iii) the allocation of the burden of proof; (iv) compliance with the principle of proportionality; (v) the existence of a causal link between the impossibility of merging abroad and the acquisition of shareholdings abroad; and (vi) the examination of the severability of the measure at issue according to the percentage of control.", "A.", "The first part of the single ground of appeal, alleging errors in determining the reference system", "1.", "Arguments of the parties", "32      The appellant submits that the General Court made several errors in determining the reference system.", "33      First of all, the appellant argues that the General Court used a reference system different from that defined by the decision at issue, since the General Court described the reference system of that decision as being the ‘tax treatment of goodwill’ and did not limit that framework to ‘the tax treatment of financial goodwill only’ (paragraphs 82 and 130 of the judgment under appeal).", "In the appellant’s view, those two ‘expressions’ relate to substantively different approaches.", "The appellant submits that by substituting its own reasoning for that of the decision at issue and by having filled, by its own reasoning, a gap in the statement of reasons for the decision at issue, the General Court committed an error of law such as to require the judgment under appeal to be set aside.", "34      Next, the appellant submits that it was unjustified for the General Court, at the end of the analysis in paragraphs 116 to 130 of the judgment under appeal, to exclude the idea that the measure at issue could constitute an autonomous reference system.", "In that regard, not only did the General Court substitute its own reasoning for that of the decision at issue, inasmuch as that decision relied solely on the absence of obstacles to cross-border mergers, but the General Court also carried out a legally incorrect examination.", "Indeed, the General Court’s reasoning, inter alia, makes the definition of the reference framework dependent on the regulatory technique used.", "35      Lastly, and in any event, the appellant submits that the reference framework adopted by the General Court in the judgment under appeal was defined arbitrarily and results from a confusion between an exception and a general rule.", "In particular, there is no explanation as to why the General Court held that the objective pursued was none other than to ‘ensure a degree of consistency between the tax treatment of goodwill and its accounting treatment’ (paragraph 111 of the judgment under appeal).", "Nor did the General Court explain why it stated that the absence of a rule precluding the amortisation of financial goodwill where a national shareholding is acquired is nothing less than the ‘general rule’ of the broad reference system which it has defined (paragraph 125 of the judgment under appeal).", "Referring in particular to the approach adopted in the case giving rise to the judgment of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission (C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505), in which the Court of Justice held that the measure at issue in that case could not be regarded as constituting an exception to a general rule, the appellant submits that the reference framework was defined reductively in the present case, with the result that the judgment under appeal should be set aside.", "36      The Commission disputes the appellant’s arguments.", "It contends, principally, that the arguments advanced are, for the most part, inadmissible, since the action before the General Court did not include any complaint that there were errors affecting the determination of the reference system.", "Consequently, to allow the appellant to raise new arguments at the appeal stage would be to authorise it to bring before the Court of Justice a case of wider ambit than that which came before the General Court.", "In the alternative, the Commission contends that the appellant’s arguments are unfounded.", "Contrary to the appellant’s submissions, first, the General Court referred to the same reference system as that identified in the decision at issue, secondly, the measure at issue cannot be regarded as an autonomous reference system and, thirdly, the judgment under appeal is reasoned to the requisite legal standard.", "2.", "Findings of the Court", "(a)    Admissibility", "37       As regards the admissibility of the arguments and evidence submitted in support of the part of the single ground of appeal under consideration – that admissibility being contested by the Commission on the ground that the arguments advanced in support of the appellant’s claims concerning the determination of the reference framework are new arguments – it should be borne in mind that, under Article 170(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, the subject matter of the proceedings before the General Court may not be changed in the appeal.", "38      Thus, according to settled case-law, the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice in an appeal is limited to review of the findings of law on the pleas and arguments debated before the General Court.", "A party cannot, therefore, put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it has not raised before the General Court since that would allow that party to bring before the Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction in appeal proceedings is limited, a wider case than that heard by the General Court (judgment of 29 July 2019, Bayerische Motoren Werke and Freistaat Sachsen v Commission, C‑654/17 P, EU:C:2019:634, paragraph 69 and the case-law cited).", "39      That said, an appellant is entitled to lodge an appeal relying, before the Court of Justice, on grounds and arguments which arise from the judgment under appeal itself and seek to criticise, in law, its correctness (judgments of 29 November 2007, Stadtwerke Schwäbisch Hall and Others v Commission, C‑176/06 P, not published, EU:C:2007:730, paragraph 17, and of 4 March 2021, Commission v Fútbol Club Barcelona, C‑362/19 P, EU:C:2021:169, paragraph 47).", "40      In the present case, it is apparent from paragraphs 82 to 131 of the judgment under appeal that the General Court examined whether the Commission had correctly identified the reference tax regime in the context of the first stage of the analysis of selectivity.", "In those circumstances, the appellant is entitled to challenge, on appeal, the grounds of the judgment under appeal relating to that first stage, notwithstanding the fact that it did not put forward at first instance arguments specifically aimed at challenging the decision at issue on that point.", "41      Furthermore, as the Advocate General observed in point 35 of his Opinion in Joined Cases World Duty Free Group and Spain v Commission (C‑51/19 P and C‑64/19 P, EU:C:2021:51), it is clear that the appellant’s arguments include a detailed and specific criticism of the grounds of the judgment under appeal and seek, to a large extent, to challenge the observance by the General Court of the limits and the detailed rules governing the exercise of its review, and could not, in any event, have been raised before it.", "42      In the light of those considerations, the first part the single ground of appeal is admissible.", "(b)    Substance", "43      The determination of the reference framework is of particular importance in the case of tax measures, since the existence of an economic advantage for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU may be established only when compared with ‘normal’ taxation.", "Thus, determination of the set of undertakings which are in a comparable factual and legal situation depends on the prior definition of the legal regime in the light of whose objective it is necessary, where applicable, to examine whether the factual and legal situation of the undertakings favoured by the measure in question is comparable with that of those which are not (judgments of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraphs 55 and 60, and of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission, C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505, paragraphs 88 and 89).", "44      For the purposes of assessing the selective nature of a tax measure of general application, it is, therefore, necessary that the common tax regime or the reference system applicable in the Member State concerned be correctly identified in the Commission decision and examined by the court hearing a dispute concerning that identification.", "Since the determination of the reference system constitutes the starting point for the comparative examination to be carried out in the context of the assessment of the selectivity of an aid scheme, an error made in that determination necessarily vitiates the whole of the analysis of the condition relating to selectivity (see, to that effect, judgments of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission, C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505, paragraph 107, and of 16 March 2021, Commission v Poland, C‑562/19 P, EU:C:2021:201, paragraph 46).", "45      In that context, it must be stated, as a preliminary point, that the determination of the reference framework, which must be carried out following an exchange of arguments with the Member State concerned, must follow from an objective examination of the content, the structure and the specific effects of the applicable rules under the national law of that State.", "In that regard, the selectivity of a tax measure cannot be assessed on the basis of a reference framework consisting of some provisions of the national law of the Member State concerned that have been artificially taken from a broader legislative framework (judgment of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission, C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505, paragraph 103).", "46      Consequently, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point 49 of his Opinion in Joined Cases World Duty Free Group and Spain v Commission (C‑51/19 P and C‑64/19 P, EU:C:2021:51), where the tax measure in question is inseparable from the general tax system of the Member State concerned, reference must be made to that system.", "On the other hand, where it appears that such a measure is clearly severable from that general system, it cannot be ruled out that the reference framework to be taken into account may be more limited than that general system, or even that it may equate to the measure itself, where the latter appears as a rule having its own legal logic and it is not possible to identify a consistent body of rules external to that measure.", "47      Next, since outside the spheres in which EU tax law has been harmonised, it is the Member State concerned which defines, by exercising its exclusive competence in the matter of direct taxation, the characteristics constituting the tax, the determination of the reference system or the ‘normal’ tax regime, from which it is necessary to analyse the condition relating to selectivity, must take account of those characteristics (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 March 2021, Commission v Poland, C‑562/19 P, EU:C:2021:201, paragraphs 38 and 39).", "48       It must also be borne in mind that, in so far as the determination of the reference framework must be based on an objective examination of the content and structure of the applicable rules under national law, it is not necessary, during that first stage of the examination of selectivity, to take account of the objectives pursued by the legislature when adopting the measure under examination.", "In that regard, the Court has held on numerous occasions that the objective pursued by measures of State intervention is not sufficient to exclude those measures outright from classification as ‘aid’ for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU, since that provision does not distinguish between measures of State intervention by reference to their causes or their aims but defines them in relation to their effects (see, to that effect, judgments of 22 December 2008, British Aggregates v Commission, C‑487/06 P, EU:C:2008:757, paragraphs 84 and 85, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraph 48).", "49      Lastly, the rules which must make up the reference system should be identified according to objective criteria, in particular to enable judicial review of the assessments on which that identification is based.", "It is for the Commission to take into account any factors put forward by the Member State concerned and, more generally, to carry out its examination in a rigorous and sufficiently reasoned manner in order to enable full judicial review.", "50      It is in the light of those considerations that the Court must assess the merits of the appellant’s arguments relating to the determination of the reference system as the first stage and necessary premiss for the analysis of selectivity.", "As is apparent from paragraphs 32 to 35 above, the appellant submits, in essence, that the General Court erred in law, first, by substituting the grounds of the decision at issue as regards the definition of the reference system adopted, secondly, by excluding the measure at issue from being regarded on its own as an autonomous reference system and by substituting grounds in that regard and, thirdly, by defining that system in an arbitrary manner.", "51      It is appropriate to examine those three complaints in turn.", "(1)    The existence of an error of law in the determination of the reference system (first complaint in the first part of the single ground of appeal)", "52 The appellant, by the first complaint in the first part of its single ground of appeal, submits that the General Court erred in law in determining the reference system by substituting its own reference system for that used by the Commission in the decision at issue.", "While the Commission had designated the rules relating to the tax treatment of financial goodwill as constituting the reference system, the General Court, relying on a substantially different analysis, also included in that system the tax treatment of ‘non-financial’ goodwill.", "The appellant refers in particular to paragraphs 82 and 130 of the judgment under appeal.", "53      In that regard, the Court of Justice points out that, in reviewing the legality of acts under Article 263 TFEU, the Court of Justice and the General Court have jurisdiction in actions brought on grounds of lack of competence, infringement of an essential procedural requirement, infringement of the Treaty or of any rule of law relating to its application, or misuse of powers.", "Article 264 TFEU provides that if the action is well founded, the act concerned must be declared void.", "The Court of Justice and the General Court cannot, therefore, under any circumstances, substitute their own reasoning for that of the author of the contested act (judgments of 27 January 2000, DIR International Film and Others v Commission, C‑164/98 P, EU:C:2000:48, paragraph 38, and of 4 June 2020, Hungary v Commission, C‑456/18 P, EU:C:2020:421, paragraph 70 and the case-law cited).", "54      Nonetheless, except where there is no material factor to justify that course of action, the General Court may be led, in proceedings for annulment, to interpret the reasoning of the contested measure in a manner which differs from that of its author, and even, in certain circumstances, to reject the latter’s formal statement of reasons (see, to that effect, judgments of 27 January 2000, DIR International Film and Others v Commission, C‑164/98 P, EU:C:2000:48, paragraph 42, and of 22 December 2008, British Aggregates v Commission, C‑487/06 P, EU:C:2008:757, paragraph 142).", "55      In the present case, as is apparent from paragraphs 57, 82, 113 and 130 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found that the Commission had used the tax treatment of ‘goodwill’ as the reference system, for the purposes of its assessment of the selectivity of the measure at issue.", "In particular, the General Court noted, in paragraph 82 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission ‘[had] not limit[ed] that framework to the tax treatment of financial goodwill only’.", "As the appellant has rightly pointed out, the Commission had stated, in recital 118 of the decision at issue, that the appropriate framework for the assessment of the measure at issue was constituted by the rules on the tax treatment of ‘financial goodwill’.", "56       However, although the terminology used in the judgment under appeal does indeed differ from that of the decision at issue, it cannot be concluded that the General Court thereby identified a reference system that was substantively different from that identified by the Commission or that it relied on a different reasoning from that of the Commission in the decision at issue in order to find that the tax treatment of goodwill constituted the relevant reference system in the present case.", "57       As the Commission contends, in the circumstances of the present case, the treatment of goodwill may be fully assimilated to the treatment of financial goodwill.", "58      In that regard, as the General Court noted in paragraph 57 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission expressly ruled out, in the decision at issue – in response inter alia to the arguments put forward by the Spanish authorities regarding the identification of the reference system – the limitation of that system to the tax treatment of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of a shareholding in a company established in a country other than Spain.", "The General Court thus emphasised that, as is clear from recital 118 of the decision at issue, the Commission had considered that the relevant reference framework or system was the general Spanish corporate tax system and, more precisely, the rules on the tax treatment of financial goodwill in the Spanish tax system, and that the Commission thus confirmed the reference system adopted in the decision of 28 October 2009.", "However, in recital 89 of that decision, the Commission had stated that the measure at issue had to be assessed in the light of the general provisions of the corporate tax system as applicable to situations in which the emergence of goodwill leads to a fiscal benefit.", "The Commission clarified, in that decision, that its position could be explained by the finding that the situations in which financial goodwill can be amortised do not cover the whole category of taxpayers placed in a similar factual or legal situation.", "59       In that context, it should be noted that, as is apparent from paragraph 58 of the judgment under appeal, for the purposes of identifying the reference system, the General Court relied, inter alia, on the Commission’s findings in recitals 28, 29, 123 and 124 of the decision at issue, according to which the reference system provided for the amortisation of goodwill only in the event of a business combination, with the result that, by allowing the goodwill that would have been booked, if the businesses had combined, to appear even in the absence of a business combination, the measure at issue constituted an exception to that reference system.", "60        In addition, referring also to recital 124 of the decision at issue, the General Court additionally relied on the Commission’s findings that, since the amortisation of goodwill deriving from the simple acquisition of shareholdings was allowed only in the case of cross-border shareholding acquisitions and not in the case of the acquisition of domestic shareholdings, the measure at issue thereby introduced a difference in treatment between domestic transactions and cross-border transactions, with the result that it could not be considered a new general rule in its own right.", "61      It is clear from those passages of the decision at issue, to which the judgment under appeal relates, that, as the General Court held, when the Commission designated the ‘rules on the tax treatment of financial goodwill’ as the reference system, it intended to refer not only to the rules specifically applicable to the amortisation of goodwill in the event of the acquisition of shareholdings, but also to the rules of the general Spanish corporate tax system governing the amortisation of goodwill in general, since those general rules do indeed provide a relevant assessment framework for those more specific rules.", "62      It follows that, in paragraphs 57, 82, 113 and 130 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court confined itself to interpreting the decision at issue as regards the definition of the reference system in a manner consistent with the particulars of that decision and did not, therefore, substitute the grounds of that decision within the meaning of the case-law referred to in paragraph 53 of the present judgment.", "Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law in determining the reference system.", "63        The first complaint in the first part of the single ground of appeal must, therefore, be rejected as unfounded.", "(2)    The refusal to consider the measure at issue as an autonomous reference system (second complaint in the first part of the single ground of appeal)", "(i)    The existence of a substitution of grounds", "64       The appellant complains that the General Court substituted its own reasoning for that of the decision at issue in ruling out the possibility that the measure at issue might constitute a reference system in its own right.", "In essence, although the Commission had in that decision dismissed the possibility of there being an autonomous reference system constituted by the measure at issue solely because of the alleged absence of legal obstacles to cross-border mergers, the General Court is argued to have relied on a different argument in paragraphs 117 to 130 of the judgment under appeal.", "65       In that regard, as has been pointed out in paragraph 58 above, it must be borne in mind that the General Court held that, from the Commission’s point of view, the reference system could not be limited to the tax treatment of financial goodwill, introduced by the measure at issue, since that measure benefited only undertakings acquiring shareholdings in non-resident companies, and that, in order to assess the existence of discrimination against undertakings making acquisitions of the same type but in resident companies, it was necessary to take account of the general provisions of the corporate tax system as applicable to situations in which the emergence of goodwill leads to a fiscal benefit.", "66       It cannot, therefore, be concluded that the General Court substituted the grounds of the decision at issue by overlooking the fact that the Commission allegedly relied, in reality, on the absence of obstacles to cross-border combinations in order to exclude the measure at issue from constituting the reference tax system.", "67       Although, as the appellant submits, the Commission did indeed refer, in recitals 93 to 96 and 117 of the decision of 28 October 2009, to the alleged absence of legal obstacles to cross-border mergers, it confined itself, by those references, to taking a position on the observations submitted by the Spanish authorities with a view, inter alia, to calling into question not only the reference system as provisionally identified in the decision of 10 October 2007 to initiate the formal investigation procedure, but also the possible elements of comparison and justification under the second and third stages of the examination of selectivity.", "68      Consequently, as the Advocate General observed in point 65 of his Opinion in Joined Cases World Duty Free Group and Spain v Commission (C‑51/19 P and C‑64/19 P, EU:C:2021:51), contrary to the appellant’s contentions, it is not because of a lack of recognition of obstacles to cross-border business combinations that the Commission decided that the measure at issue could not be the correct reference system for the purposes of the selectivity analysis, but because it took the view that that measure should be assessed in the light of a broader set of rules, which included both the rules applicable to the amortisation of financial goodwill in the case of the acquisition of shareholdings in resident companies and the principles applicable to the amortisation of goodwill in general, which, according to the Commission, were aligned with each other in providing that goodwill was deductible only if the acquisition of a shareholding was followed by a business combination.", "69      It follows that the claim that the General Court substituted grounds, in paragraphs 117 to 130 of the judgment under appeal, is unfounded.", "(ii) The existence of an error of law in the General Court’s refusal to regard the measure at issue as an autonomous reference system", "70       The appellant submits, in the alternative, that the reasoning followed by the General Court in order to rule out the possibility that the measure at issue might constitute an autonomous reference system is vitiated by an error of law.", "First, it observes that the aim of that measure is to ensure fiscal neutrality with regard to acquisitions of shareholdings in Spain and abroad and, accordingly, its purpose cannot be reduced to that of solving a specific problem, as the General Court incorrectly stated in paragraph 129 of the judgment under appeal.", "Secondly, it argues that the General Court’s reasoning leads to the selectivity of a measure being assessed differently, depending on whether the national legislature decided to create a separate tax or to modify a general tax, and, therefore, depending on the regulatory technique used.", "71      In the present case, the Court of Justice notes that the reasoning set out by the General Court in paragraphs 85 to 131 of the judgment under appeal was intended to respond to the argument that, because of the obstacles to cross-border combinations, the Commission ought to have identified the measure at issue as the reference system.", "72      Although the appellant does not criticise the methodology applicable to the determination of the reference system in the context of the first stage of the examination of selectivity set out in paragraphs 85 to 98 of the judgment under appeal, it does, however, criticise the remainder of the examination carried out by the General Court, as set out in paragraphs 99 to 131 of that judgment.", "73      As regards, in the first place, the reasoning set out in paragraphs 99 to 115 of the judgment under appeal, that reasoning is concerned with the issue whether, in the light of the objective of the normal regime identified by the Commission, undertakings acquiring shareholdings in resident companies and those acquiring shareholdings in non-resident companies are in a comparable legal and factual situation.", "74      However, that examination of comparability is not directly connected to the delimitation of the reference framework which must be carried out under the first stage of the examination of selectivity, notwithstanding the fact that, in paragraph 115 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found ‘the existence of links between those two steps, or even in some cases, such as the present, a common line of reasoning’.", "Thus, the arguments advanced by the appellant in order to challenge the definition of the objective of the reference system will be assessed at a later stage, in the context of the examination of the second part of the single ground of appeal, alleging an error in the determination of the objective in the light of which the examination of comparability had to be carried out.", "75       In the second place, as regards paragraphs 116 to 131 of the judgment under appeal, in those paragraphs the General Court examined whether the measure at issue could in itself, in the light of its own specific characteristics and therefore regardless of any comparative analysis, constitute an autonomous reference framework.", "76       In that regard, first, the appellant is wrong to argue that the General Court relied primarily on the regulatory technique chosen by the Spanish legislature, in order to conclude that the measure at issue was selective.", "It is indeed apparent from the judgment under appeal that the General Court relied on the purpose and effects of that measure and not on merely formal considerations.", "In particular, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 125 of that judgment, that the measure at issue constituted an exception to the general rule that only business combinations may lead to the amortisation of goodwill.", "77      Admittedly, as the appellant has rightly argued, it is apparent from the case-law that the use of a particular regulatory technique cannot enable national tax rules to evade, from the outset, scrutiny under State aid rules as provided for under the FEU Treaty, nor is such use sufficient to define the relevant reference framework for the purposes of assessing the condition relating to selectivity, since that would cause the form of State intervention to prevail decisively over its effects.", "Consequently, the regulatory technique used cannot be decisive for the purposes of determining the reference framework (see, to that effect, the judgment in WDFG, paragraph 76, and judgment of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission, C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505, paragraph 92).", "78      However, it follows from that case-law that while for the purposes of establishing the selectivity of a tax measure the regulatory technique used is not decisive, with the result that it is not always necessary for it to derogate from a common tax system, the fact that it is a derogation as a result of the use of that regulatory technique is relevant for those purposes where it follows that two categories of operators are distinguished and a priori treated differently, namely those covered by the derogation and those which are covered by the ordinary taxation regime, even though those two categories are in a comparable situation with regard to the objective pursued by that system (judgment of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission, C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505, paragraph 93 and the case-law cited).", "79      It follows that the General Court cannot be criticised for having held, among other considerations, that the measure at issue constituted a derogation in order to examine whether it was selective.", "80      Secondly, as regards the appellant’s criticism of the reference to the Opinion of Advocate General Warner in Italy v Commission (173/73, EU:C:1974:52; ‘Advocate General Warner’s Opinion’; p. 728), the General Court rightly pointed out, in paragraph 125 of the judgment under appeal, that, as the Commission correctly stated in recital 124 of the decision at issue, the measure at issue had not introduced a new general rule in its own right relating to the amortisation of goodwill; it had, on the contrary, introduced an ‘exception to the general rule’ that only business combinations may lead to the amortisation of goodwill, with that exception, in the Kingdom of Spain’s view, being intended to remedy the adverse effects for the acquisition of shareholdings in non-resident companies created by applying the general rule.", "81      Consequently, it is apparent from the judgment under appeal that, in support of its conclusion that the reference system could not be limited to the measure at issue alone, the General Court did not rely solely on the fact that that measure, like the measure at issue in the case which gave rise to Advocate General Warner’s Opinion, was intended to pursue a targeted objective and thus to solve a specific problem.", "It follows that the arguments advanced by the appellant, first, objecting to the present case’s being placed on the same footing as that which gave rise to Advocate General Warner’s Opinion and, secondly, intended to demonstrate that the objective of the measure at issue was to safeguard the principle of fiscal neutrality, and not to solve a specific problem, are insufficient to invalidate the General Court’s reasoning and are, therefore, ineffective.", "82      In any event, it must be borne in mind that the mere fact that the measure at issue is of a general nature, in that it may a priori benefit all undertakings subject to corporate tax, does not mean that it cannot be selective.", "As the Court of Justice has already held, with respect to a national measure conferring a tax advantage of general application, like the measure at issue, the condition relating to selectivity is fulfilled where the Commission is able to demonstrate that that measure is a derogation from the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, thereby introducing, through its actual effects, differences in the treatment of operators, although the operators who qualify for the tax advantage and those who do not are, in the light of the objective pursued by that Member State’s tax system, in a comparable factual and legal situation (the judgment in WDFG, paragraph 67).", "83      In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the second complaint in the first part of the single ground of appeal must be rejected as ineffective and, in any event, unfounded.", "(3)    The arbitrary nature of the definition of the reference system (third complaint in the first part of the single ground of appeal)", "84       In the third complaint in the first part of its single ground of appeal, the appellant submits, first, that the reference system used by the General Court was defined arbitrarily, since it is difficult to identify the criterion specifically used to identify the coherent framework of which the measure at issue forms part.", "It submits, secondly, that the General Court erroneously and invalidly identified, in the reference system which it defined, what constitutes the rule and what constitutes the exception.", "According to the appellant, the General Court was wrong to hold, in paragraph 125 of the judgment under appeal, that the rule was that it was impossible to amortise goodwill and that the measure at issue introduced an exception to that rule.", "As in the case which gave rise to the judgment of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission (C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505), the General Court confused the rule with the exception.", "85      The first submission, alleging that the General Court arbitrarily defined the reference system at issue, must be rejected since, as is apparent from paragraphs 58 to 61 above, the General Court set out to the requisite legal standard the reasoning which led it to refer, in the circumstances of the present case, to the rules applicable under Spanish law to the tax treatment of goodwill for the purposes of determining corporate tax and, thus, to confirm the assessment in that regard in the decision at issue.", "It should be borne in mind that the premiss on which the Commission relied is based on the finding, endorsed by the General Court, that under Spanish law amortisation of goodwill is generally conditional on there being a business combination.", "86      The second submission, alleging that the General Court erroneously and invalidly identified the rule and the exception, must also be rejected.", "In accordance with the interpretation of the Spanish tax legislation adopted by the General Court, only a business combination generally allows the amortisation of goodwill, including in the case of financial goodwill resulting from the acquisition of shareholdings in resident companies, in accordance with Article 89(3) of the Corporate Tax Law, as approved by Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004.", "It is not, therefore, the non-amortisation of financial goodwill which constitutes the general rule from which the measure at issue derogates, but the principle that the amortisation is generally possible only in the case of a business combination; the General Court inferred that principle from the provisions on the tax treatment of goodwill for corporate tax purposes, whether those provisions relate to the amortisation of goodwill in the case of an acquisition of an undertaking or to the amortisation of financial goodwill resulting from the acquisition of shareholdings in resident companies followed by a merger.", "87      In the light of those considerations, the third complaint in the first part of the single ground of appeal and, consequently, the first part of that ground of appeal in its entirety, must be rejected as unfounded.", "B.", "The second part of the single ground of appeal, alleging an error in the determination of the objective in the light of which the examination of comparability is carried out", "1.", "Arguments of the parties", "88      The appellant, in the context of the second part of its single ground of appeal, disputes the grounds of the judgment under appeal, set out in paragraphs 133 to 154 thereof, by which the General Court identified the objective of the reference system and, in the light of that objective, compared the situation of the undertakings qualifying for the advantage established by the measure at issue and those which do not.", "89      The appellant submits, in the first place, that the General Court erred in law in determining the objective underlying the comparison to be carried out in the second stage of the examination of the selectivity of the measure at issue.", "The General Court, which again departed from the decision at issue, misinterpreted the case-law on the determination of the objective applicable to a tax measure.", "Contrary to what the General Court suggests, there is no contradiction in the case-law of the Court of Justice as to whether the situation of the undertakings qualifying for the ‘measure at issue’ and that of those not qualifying must be compared in the light of the objective of that measure or that of the ‘system of which it forms part’.", "According to the appellant, those objectives must coincide and, if they do not, it is because the national legislature introduced into the tax system a measure which is inconsistent with its logic.", "In the present case, the true objective of the regime by reference to which the comparison should be made is, as the Commission itself acknowledged in the decision at issue, fiscal neutrality.", "Fiscal neutrality is a much more general and logical objective than the parallelism, referred to by the General Court, between the accounting treatment and tax treatment of the goodwill from which an undertaking benefits as a result of acquiring shareholdings in a company, since as a matter of principle any corporate tax departs by definition from the accounting result.", "90      In the second place, the appellant submits that the General Court was wrong to hold, in paragraph 111 of the judgment under appeal, that the objective of the tax provisions on goodwill was to ensure a degree of consistency between the tax treatment of goodwill and its accounting treatment.", "That assertion is not only arbitrary, but wholly unfounded, since by definition all corporate taxes differ from the accounting result.", "As regards specifically the provisions on the amortisation of goodwill, the various situations provided for by the Corporate Tax Law, as approved by Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004, have in common not the objective of ensuring consistency between the tax treatment and accounting treatment of goodwill, but rather that of avoiding double taxation and of ensuring fiscal neutrality.", "91      The Commission contends that those arguments, which it considers inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded, should be rejected.", "2.", "Findings of the Court", "(a)    Admissibility", "92      The Commission contends that the second part of the single ground of appeal is inadmissible.", "It maintains that the arguments put forward were not raised before the General Court or relate to questions of fact, which include the interpretation of the content and scope of national law.", "93      As regards the first plea of inadmissibility raised by the Commission, it must be rejected on the same grounds as those set out in paragraphs 39 to 41 above.", "A party is entitled to put forward pleas and arguments arising from the judgment under appeal itself and which seek to criticise, in law, its correctness.", "The appellant is, therefore, entitled to call into question the findings made by the General Court, irrespective of the fact that it did not put forward at first instance arguments intended specifically to challenge the decision at issue on that point.", "94       As regards the second plea of inadmissibility raised by the Commission, alleging that the appellant intended to call into question findings of fact which are not, in principle, subject to review by the Court of Justice, it must be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law, the assessment of facts and evidence does not constitute, save where the clear sense of the facts and evidence has been distorted, a question of law which is subject as such to review by the Court of Justice in the context of an appeal.", "It is only when the General Court has established or assessed the facts that the Court of Justice has jurisdiction under Article 256 TFEU to review the legal characterisation of those facts and the legal conclusions which have been drawn from them (judgment of 25 July 2018, Commission v Spain and Others, C‑128/16 P, EU:C:2018:591, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited).", "95      Thus, with respect to the assessment in the context of an appeal of the General Court’s findings on national law, which, in the field of State aid, constitute findings of fact, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction only to determine whether that law was distorted.", "By contrast, since the assessment in the context of an appeal of the legal classification which has been attributed to that national law by the General Court under a provision of EU law constitutes a question of law, it falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice (judgment of 28 June 2018, Andres (insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding) v Commission, C‑203/16 P, EU:C:2018:505, paragraph 78 and the case-law cited).", "96      Furthermore, as has been pointed out in paragraph 53 above, the General Court cannot, under any circumstances, substitute its own reasoning for that of the author of the contested act, with the result that the Court of Justice has jurisdiction in an appeal to ascertain whether the General Court has made such a substitution and thus erred in law.", "97      Since by its arguments summarised in paragraphs 88 to 90 above the appellant essentially complains that the General Court substituted its own reasoning for that of the decision at issue, concerning the ‘objective’ in the light of which the situations of the undertakings qualifying for the advantage resulting from the application of the measure at issue and those not qualifying must be compared, those arguments are admissible.", "(b)    Substance", "98      In the first place, as regards the argument directed against the General Court’s conclusion that the case-law is inconsistent as to whether the comparison should be carried out in the light of the objective of the measure examined or that of the system of which that measure forms part, that argument must be rejected as ineffective.", "99      The appellant merely asserts that the choice between one or other objective is immaterial since they must, in principle, coincide.", "Consequently, even if the General Court’s findings in relation to the scope of the case-law of the Court of Justice were to be incorrect, it must be observed that the appellant does not challenge the General Court’s conclusion, set out in paragraph 146 of the judgment under appeal, that the examination of comparability at the second stage of the analysis of selectivity has to be carried out in the light of the objective of the reference system of which the measure under examination forms part, and not in the light of that measure’s objective.", "100    In the second place, the appellant raises a complaint alleging the substitution of the grounds of the decision at issue as regards the identification of the reference system’s objective.", "It submits that the objective of ensuring ‘a degree of consistency between the tax treatment of goodwill and its accounting treatment’, referred to in paragraph 111 of the judgment under appeal, is in no way reflected in either the decision at issue or the observations submitted by the Kingdom of Spain during the administrative procedure.", "The appellant also submits that, in any event, the assertion that the tax provisions on goodwill pursue such an objective is arbitrary and unfounded.", "101    In the present case, it must be noted that the Commission did not at any point of the decision at issue state that the objective of the reference system that it identified included maintaining a degree of consistency between the tax treatment and accounting treatment of goodwill.", "102    Admittedly, the General Court referred, in paragraphs 107 to 109 of the judgment under appeal, to some of the findings in that decision when it stated that the tax treatment of goodwill is based on the criterion of whether or not a business combination has arisen; it also explained, by reference to recitals 28 and 123 of the decision at issue, that that circumstance is due to the fact that, following an acquisition or contribution of the assets constituting independent businesses or even a merger or a de-merger, ‘goodwill … appears, as a separate intangible asset, in the books of the combined business’ (paragraph 107 of the judgment under appeal).", "Similarly, the statement that the tax treatment of goodwill is ‘in line with an accounting logic’ (paragraph 106 of the judgment under appeal) follows on from certain considerations set out by the Commission in the decision at issue, in particular in recitals 121 to 124 thereof.", "103    However, it was without reference to that decision and on the basis of its own interpretation of the tax and accounting rules applicable under Spanish law that the General Court concluded that the objective of the rules on the amortisation of financial goodwill contained in the Corporate Tax Law, as approved by Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004, was consistency between the tax treatment and accounting treatment of goodwill and that, in the light of that objective, the situation of undertakings investing in Spanish companies is comparable to that of undertakings investing in non-resident companies.", "104    Consequently, by substituting its own reasoning for that of the decision at issue, the General Court erred in law.", "105    It is necessary, however, to examine whether, notwithstanding the error of law made by the General Court, the second complaint of the first plea in law relied on by the appellant in support of its action before that court should in any event have been rejected, inasmuch as it criticised the Commission for failing to demonstrate that the acquisitions of shareholdings in resident companies and those in non-resident companies were comparable in the light of the objective of fiscal neutrality pursued by the measure at issue.", "106    Indeed, according to settled case-law, if the grounds of a judgment of the General Court disclose an infringement of EU law but the operative part is shown to be well founded on other legal grounds, such an infringement is not capable of bringing about the setting aside of that judgment (judgments of 30 September 2003, Biret International v Council, C‑93/02 P, EU:C:2003:517, paragraph 60 and the case-law cited, and of 14 October 2014, Buono and Others v Commission, C‑12/13 P and C‑13/13 P, EU:C:2014:2284, paragraph 62 and the case-law cited).", "107    In that regard, it must be borne in mind that, in accordance with the case-law mentioned in paragraph 28 above, to which the General Court was fully entitled to refer in paragraph 135 of the judgment under appeal, the examination of comparability at the second stage of the analysis of selectivity must be carried out in the light of the objective of the reference system and not that of the measure at issue.", "108    In the present case, the appellant submits that the objective of the reference system, which, in its view, is indissociable from that of the measure at issue, is to preserve fiscal neutrality.", "It states that, in the light of that objective, undertakings which acquire shareholdings in domestic companies and those which acquire shareholdings in cross-border companies are in different situations because of the obstacles to cross-border business combinations.", "109    As the Court of Justice has held, a measure such as the measure at issue, which is designed to facilitate exports, may be regarded as selective if it benefits undertakings carrying out cross-border transactions, in particular investment transactions, and is to the disadvantage of other undertakings which, while in a comparable factual and legal situation, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax system concerned, carry out other transactions of the same kind within the national territory (the judgment in WDFG, paragraph 119).", "110    In the present case, the General Court was fully entitled to find, in paragraph 112 of the judgment under appeal, that undertakings which acquire shareholdings in non-resident companies are, in the light of the objective pursued by the tax treatment of goodwill, in a comparable factual and legal situation to that of undertakings which acquire shareholdings in resident companies.", "Since undertakings which acquire cross-border minority shareholdings may benefit from the measure at issue even though they are not affected by the alleged obstacles to business combinations to which the appellant refers, it cannot be claimed that, because of those obstacles, the beneficiaries of the measure at issue are in a different legal and factual situation from that of undertakings covered by the normal tax system.", "111    In the light of those considerations, it must be concluded that, notwithstanding the error of law by the General Court in substituting its own reasoning for that of the decision at issue in the examination of the definition of the reference system’s objective, the second part of the single ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "C.", "The third part of the single ground of appeal, alleging an error of law in the allocation of the burden of proof", "1.", "Arguments of the parties", "112    The appellant submits that by failing to examine, during the first and second stages of the analysis of selectivity, which undertakings were in a comparable situation in the light of the reference system’s objective of fiscal neutrality and by deferring that examination to the third stage, the General Court reversed the burden of proof.", "In that regard, it follows from the case-law that, during the first and second stages of the examination of the selectivity of a measure, the burden of proving that the situations are comparable in the light of the objective pursued lies with the Commission.", "113    The Commission contends that the appellant’s arguments are inadmissible and, in any event, unfounded.", "2.", "Findings of the Court", "114    In the first place, as regards the plea of inadmissibility raised by the Commission in respect of the appellant’s arguments, it must be rejected on the same grounds as those set out in paragraphs 39 to 41 above.", "A party is entitled to put forward pleas and arguments arising from the judgment under appeal itself and which seek to criticise, in law, its correctness.", "The appellant is, therefore, entitled to call into question the findings made by the General Court, irrespective of the fact that it did not put forward at first instance arguments intended specifically to challenge the decision at issue on that point.", "115    As regards the merits of the third part of the single ground of appeal, the appellant complains specifically that the General Court took account of the fact that the measure at issue pursued an objective of fiscal neutrality only at the third stage of the analysis of the selectivity of the measure at issue, and not at the first and second stages of that analysis.", "116    The appellant’s arguments are based on the premiss that the General Court erred in law in determining the reference system’s objective as the consistency between the tax treatment and accounting treatment of goodwill, and not the principle of fiscal neutrality.", "117    Suffice it to note in that regard that, as is apparent from the considerations set out in paragraphs 98 to 111 above, although the General Court erred in finding that the objective of the reference system concerned the consistency between the tax treatment and accounting treatment of goodwill, it has not been established that the objective of fiscal neutrality was such as to preclude the aid from being found to be selective at the second stage of the analysis of selectivity.", "118    The third part of the single ground of appeal must, therefore, be rejected as ineffective.", "D.", "The fourth part of the single ground of appeal, alleging an error in the application of the principle of proportionality", "1.", "Arguments of the parties", "119    The appellant submits, in essence, that the General Court erred in law by examining the proportionality of the measure at issue without having first assessed whether the situations at issue were comparable in the light of the correctly identified objective of the reference system, namely fiscal neutrality.", "It submits that the examination of the measure at issue from the point of view of compliance with the principle of proportionality, at the third stage of the analysis of selectivity, serves no purpose and has no justification in the present case.", "It is only after examining whether the measure discriminates between comparable situations in the light of its objective that it should be considered whether that measure is justified by the fact that it is inherent to the essential principles of the system of which it forms part and complies with the principles of consistency and proportionality.", "120    The Commission contends that the fourth part of the single ground of appeal is ineffective and, in any event, unfounded.", "2.", "Findings of the Court", "121    It must be stated that the appellant’s arguments are based on the premiss that the General Court erred in law by deferring the analysis of the proportionality of the measure at issue to the third stage of the examination of selectivity.", "122     Those arguments cannot, however, be upheld, since, as is apparent from the case-law, the question whether a selective advantage complies with the principle of proportionality arises at the third stage of the examination of selectivity, which examines whether that advantage can be justified by the nature or general scheme of the tax system of the Member State concerned.", "At that stage, the Member State is thus called on to demonstrate that a difference in treatment arising from the measure’s objective is consistent with the principle of proportionality, in that it does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective and the objective could not be achieved by less restrictive measures (see, to that effect, judgment of 8 September 2011, Paint Graphos and Others, C‑78/08 to C‑80/08, EU:C:2011:550, paragraph 75).", "123    Consequently, the fourth part of the single ground of appeal must also be rejected.", "E.", "The fifth part of the single ground of appeal, alleging an error of law relating to the causal link between the impossibility of cross-border mergers and the acquisition of shareholdings in foreign companies", "1.", "Arguments of the parties", "124    The appellant submits, in essence, that the grounds of the judgment under appeal relating to the third stage of the analysis of selectivity, set out in paragraphs 170 to 179 of the judgment under appeal, are vitiated by an error of law since the General Court required proof from the Kingdom of Spain of the existence of ‘a causal link between the impossibility of merging abroad and the acquisition of shareholdings abroad’.", "The appellant submits, first, that those grounds introduce an element of analysis which does not appear in the decision at issue and indeed conflicts with its rationale and, secondly, that the proof requested by the General Court is impossible to furnish.", "125    The Commission contends that the fifth part of the single ground of appeal should be rejected.", "2.", "Findings of the Court", "126    It should be noted that, in paragraphs 170 to 179 of the judgment under appeal, which are the only paragraphs referred to in the fifth part of the single ground of appeal, the General Court set out the reasons why the Kingdom of Spain had failed to establish that the measure at issue offset the alleged detrimental effects of the normal regime.", "127    However, as a supplementary point, it continued its analysis on the assumption that such offsetting had been demonstrated (paragraphs 180 to 188 of the judgment under appeal).", "The grounds of the judgment under appeal referred to in the fifth part of the single ground of appeal are not, therefore, the only grounds on which the General Court based its conclusion that the Commission did not err in finding that the Kingdom of Spain had not justified the differentiation introduced by the measure at issue.", "128     In accordance with settled case-law, on an appeal, a plea that is directed against a ground in the judgment under appeal, the operative part of which is sufficiently founded in law on other grounds, is ineffective and must, therefore, be rejected.", "In the present case, even if the fifth part of the single ground of appeal were well founded, it must, inasmuch as it is incapable of invalidating the judgment under appeal, be rejected as ineffective, since the conclusion in question remains well-founded on other grounds (see, to that effect, judgment of 29 March 2011, Anheuser-Busch v Budějovický Budvar, C‑96/09 P, EU:C:2011:189, paragraph 211 and the case-law cited).", "129    It follows that the fifth part of the single ground of appeal must be rejected as ineffective.", "F.", "The sixth part of the single ground of appeal, alleging an error of law in the examination of the severability of the measure at issue according to the percentage of control", "1.", "Arguments of the parties", "130    The appellant complains that the General Court rejected its plea that was based on the absence of any distinction, in the Commission’s analysis, between acquisitions of minority shareholdings and acquisitions of majority shareholdings.", "The appellant states, first, that all the transactions it carried out in the context of the measure at issue led to the acquisition of control over the target company and, secondly, that the Kingdom of Spain had asked the Commission to analyse the two situations separately.", "According to the appellant, it is clear from the case-law that if the Member State concerned so requests, the Commission is required to conduct a separate analysis of the measure under examination.", "As to the severability of the measure at issue, this is apparent from the procedural treatment which the Commission accorded to the analysis of that measure, which resulted in three different decisions.", "2.", "Findings of the Court", "131    The sixth part of the single ground of appeal is directed against paragraphs 196 to 206 of the judgment under appeal, by which the General Court examined whether the Commission was required to distinguish between the various transactions which benefited from the application of the measure at issue.", "132    In the present case, it must be stated that the grounds of the judgment under appeal set out in those paragraphs – which were intended to respond to the appellant’s argument that it was for the Commission to distinguish between acquisitions of shareholdings in non-resident companies resulting in the acquisition of control and other acquisitions of shareholdings, in order to declare that the application of the measure at issue to the acquisitions of shareholdings in non-resident companies did not entail classification as State aid – were included for the sake of completeness.", "133     Indeed, the appellant’s argument that the Commission was required to make such a distinction was rejected, principally, in paragraph 195 of the judgment under appeal, in which the General Court held, in essence, that the inconsistency introduced by the measure at issue in respect of the tax treatment of goodwill would exist even if that measure benefited only acquisitions of majority shareholdings in non-resident companies.", "134    As has been pointed out in paragraph 128 above, on an appeal a plea that is directed against a ground included for the sake of completeness in the judgment under appeal, the operative part of which is sufficiently founded in law on other grounds, is ineffective and must, therefore, be rejected.", "135    In any event, the appellant’s arguments in the sixth part of its single ground of appeal are unfounded.", "136    In that regard, it is true that, in the decision which it adopts at the end of its examination, the Commission may, in the exercise of its discretion, differentiate between the beneficiaries of the aid scheme notified, having regard to certain characteristics they display or conditions which they fulfil.", "On the other hand, as the General Court rightly pointed out in paragraph 196 of the judgment under appeal, it was not for the Commission, in the decision at issue, to determine conditions for the application of the measure at issue which might have made it possible, in certain situations, for it not to classify that measure as aid.", "Such a question is a matter for dialogue between the Spanish authorities and the Commission, as part of the notification of the scheme at issue, which ought to have taken place before the scheme was put into effect.", "137    In the present case, in its action at first instance, the appellant complained that the Commission, in essence, failed to distinguish between acquisitions of shareholdings in non-resident companies resulting in the acquisition of control and other acquisitions of shareholdings for the purposes of declaring that the application of the measure at issue to that former category of acquisitions of shareholdings in non-resident companies did not entail classification as State aid.", "In that regard, the General Court recalled, in paragraph 203 of the judgment under appeal, that, with regard to the justification for the distinction drawn by the measure at issue, it is for the Member State concerned to establish that that distinction is justified and also to amend the content or the conditions for the application of that measure if it is apparent that it is justified only in part.", "The General Court did not err in law in concluding therefrom, in paragraph 205 of the judgment under appeal, that, even if the Commission’s examination, during the formal investigation procedure, of cases regarding the acquisition of majority shareholdings was discussed specifically by the Commission and the Kingdom of Spain on the basis of the documented requests submitted by that Member State, the appellant’s complaint had, in any event, to be rejected in the circumstances of the case.", "138    Consequently, the sixth part of the single ground of appeal must be rejected as ineffective and, in any event, unfounded.", "139    Since none of the parts of the single ground of appeal has been upheld, the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.", "V.", "Costs", "140    Under Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to costs.", "In accordance with Article 138(1) of those rules of procedure, applicable to the procedure on an appeal by reason of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "141    In the present case, since the Commission has applied for costs and the appellant has been unsuccessful, the appellant must be ordered to pay the costs of the present appeal and of the proceedings before the General Court.", "On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby:", "1.", "Dismisses the appeal;", "2.", "Orders Prosegur

[3F] submitted that the fiscal rules applicable to seafarers employed on board vessels registered in the DIS register constituted State aid for the purposes of Article 88 EC and that the aid scheme in question was not compatible with the common market, since it allowed tax exemptions not only to Community seafarers, that is to say, seafarers resident for tax purposes in a Member State, but also to all seafarers including non‑Community seafarers, which made it contrary both to the Commission document on financial and fiscal measures concerning shipping operations with ships registered in the Community (document SEC(89) 921 final …) and to the Community guidelines on State aid to maritime transport (OJ 1997 C 205, p. 5 …). [3F] also alleged that the provisions of the double taxation conventions entered into between, first, the Kingdom of Denmark and the Republic of the Philippines and, secondly, the Kingdom of Denmark and the Republic of Singapore also constituted an unlawful aid scheme.", "It submitted that the Commission should initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) EC and drew attention to the procedure concerning an action for failure to act provided for in Article 232 EC.", "4 By letter of 21 October 1998 [3F] drew the Commission’s attention to its obligation to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC and stated that, according to its information, the fiscal scheme at issue had not been notified to the Commission.", "5 By letter of 6 January 1999 [3F] stated inter alia that it would not bring an action for failure to act before the Court of Justice if the Commission gave it an assurance that it would adopt a decision within two or three months, while reserving the possibility of doing so thereafter.", "6 By letter of 4 February 1999 the Commission requested information from the Kingdom of Denmark, in particular as to whether the aid at issue had been paid or was going to be paid.", "7 By letter of 18 March 1999 [3F] sent new observations to the Commission in relation to the meaning of “Community seafarers”.", "8 On 19 March 1999 a meeting took place between the Commission and the Kingdom of Denmark, at which the Commission expressed its concerns regarding the specific fiscal rules which applied at that time to seafarers.", "9 By letter of 13 April 1999 the Kingdom of Denmark replied to the Commission’s letter of 4 February 1999, stating inter alia that the tax scheme at issue had been introduced in 1988.", "It also indicated that it was carrying out an investigation concerning the amendment of the rules for taxing the wages of non-residents.", "It added that the Commission would be informed as soon as the investigation was completed and the Danish Government had decided whether a draft bill would be presented to the Danish Parliament during the following session.", "10 On 4 June 1999 [3F] informed the Commission of the answer of a Danish minister to the Danish Parliament raising the possibility that the DIS scheme might be amended.", "11 By letter of 6 December 1999 the Danish Government submitted to the Danish Parliament a draft tax bill amending the DIS scheme.", "12 By letter of 10 January 2000 [3F] sent observations concerning the effects of the unamended DIS scheme to the Commission.", "13 By letter of 3 April 2000 the Danish Ministry of Taxation informed the Commission of the amendments to the draft bill.", "14 A meeting took place on 4 April 2000 between the Commission and the Danish authorities, at the end of which it emerged that a further review would be necessary in the light of the latest amendments to the draft bill.", "15 By letter of 6 April 2000 the Kingdom of Denmark stated that the amendments to the draft tax bill introduced following the discussions with the Commission at the meeting of 4 April 2000 would not be submitted to the Danish Parliament until the Commission formally stated that they were not contrary to Community law, and requested a comfort letter from the Commission to that effect as soon as possible.", "16 By letters of 18 April and 15 May 2000 [3F] sent observations concerning the amendments to the draft tax bill to the Commission.", "17 On 30 November 2000 the Commission sought additional information from the Kingdom of Denmark, in particular concerning fiscal issues.", "The Kingdom of Denmark responded to that request on 15 January 2001.", "18 [3F] sent observations to the Commission by letters of 1 February, 29 June and 5 November 2001.", "19 A meeting took place on 27 May 2002 between the Commission and [3F], at which [3F] raised the possibility of bringing an action for failure to act.", "…", "20 On 13 November 2002 the Commission adopted [the contested decision], in which it decided not to raise any objections to the fiscal measures applied since 1 January 1989 to seafarers employed on board vessels registered in Denmark in either the DAS or the DIS register, since it considered that the arrangements constituted State aid but were compatible with the common market in accordance with Article 87(3)(c) EC.’", "Proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice", "3 By application lodged at the Registry of the Court of First Instance (now ‘the General Court’) on 30 January 2003, 3F sought the annulment of the contested decision.", "4 By separate document lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 17 March 2003, the Commission raised a plea of inadmissibility under Article 114 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, asking the General Court to dismiss the action as manifestly inadmissible.", "5 By order of 23 April 2007 in Case T‑30/03 SID v Commission, the General Court dismissed the action as inadmissible.", "6 By application lodged at the Registry of the Court of Justice on 9 July 2007, 3F brought an appeal pursuant to Article 56 of the Statute of the Court of Justice against that order.", "7 By judgment of 9 July 2009 in Case C‑319/07 P 3F v Commission [2009] ECR I‑5963, the Court of Justice set aside the order of the General Court in SID v Commission in so far as it did not address 3F’s arguments relating, first, to its competitive position in relation to other trade unions in the negotiation of collective agreements applicable to seafarers and, second, to the social aspects of the fiscal measures in relation to seafarers employed on board vessels registered in the DIS register.", "The Court of Justice then rejected the plea of inadmissibility raised by the Commission before the General Court.", "Finally, it remitted the case to the General Court for it to rule on 3F’s claim for the annulment of the contested decision.", "The judgment under appeal", "8 3F, which withdrew at the hearing before the General Court two of the three pleas in law relied upon in its application, maintained, in support of its action for annulment, the plea alleging infringement of Article 88(2) EC and of the principle of good administration.", "It submitted in this regard that serious difficulties arose in the present instance which should have led the Commission to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC; those serious difficulties were apparent from the length of the preliminary examination procedure and the circumstances of that procedure.", "9 So far as concerns, in the first place, the length of the preliminary examination procedure, the General Court stated in paragraph 59 of the judgment under appeal, after noting that in the case in point more than four years had elapsed between receipt of the complaint and the contested decision, that the Commission maintained, in order to explain that length, ‘that the complaint was voluminous, that it attempted to address all of its aspects, including the issue of the bilateral tax agreements, and that the behaviour of [3F], which sent ten letters to the Commission, contributed to the extension of the preliminary examination procedure’.", "10 In paragraphs 60 to 67 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court, after noting the various exchanges and meetings which took place following the complaint between the Commission and, as the case may be, 3F or the Kingdom of Denmark regarding, inter alia, the meaning of ‘Community seafarers’, the Kingdom of Denmark’s responses to the Commission’s supplementary questions and the possibility of the DIS scheme being amended by the Danish legislature, found that those exchanges had contributed to the extension of the length of the preliminary examination and that they explained, to a large extent, the length of that examination in this case.", "It held that the Commission was entitled to consider it necessary to examine all the matters of fact and law thereby brought to its attention and to make further enquiries of the Kingdom of Denmark, including in relation to the question of the bilateral tax treaties.", "11 In those circumstances, the General Court held as follows in paragraphs 68 to 72 of the judgment under appeal:", "‘68 … even if, considered as a whole, the duration of the preliminary examination can be regarded as exceeding the time usually required for a preliminary examination, that duration is justified to a large extent by the circumstances and context of the procedure.", "69 However, as [3F] notes in its reply, the question in this case is not whether or not the duration of the preliminary examination was reasonable but whether there were serious difficulties.", "70 While the length of the preliminary examination can constitute an indication of the existence of serious difficulties, it does not of itself suffice to show the existence of such difficulties.", "71 In particular, the mere fact that discussions took place between the Commission and the Member State concerned during the preliminary examination stage and that, in that context, the Commission asked for additional information about the measures submitted for its review cannot in itself be regarded as evidence that the Commission was confronted with serious difficulties of assessment (see [Case T‑46/97 SIC v Commission [2000] ECR II‑2125], paragraph 89 and the case-law cited).", "72 Moreover, it is only if it is reinforced by other factors that the passage of time, even if that time considerably exceeds the time usually required for a preliminary examination under Article 88(3) EC, may lead to the conclusion that the Commission encountered serious difficulties of assessment necessitating initiation of the procedure under Article 88(2) EC (see, to that effect, [Case T‑95/03 Asociación de Estaciones de Servicio de Madrid and Federación Catalana de Estaciones de Servicio v Commission [2006] ECR II‑4739], paragraph 135 and the case-law cited).’", "12 So far as concerns, in the second place, the other arguments relied upon by 3F, concerning the circumstances of the preliminary examination procedure, the General Court, first, ruled on the argument that the amendments made to the DIS scheme by the draft bill sent by the Kingdom of Denmark appeared to be a complicating factor in the file, even though the contested decision did not rule on those amendments.", "It held, at the end of paragraphs 74 to 82 of the judgment under appeal, that 3F had not proven that those amendments showed the existence of serious difficulties as to the assessment of the compatibility of the DIS scheme with the common market, in particular in relation to the meaning of ‘Community seafarers’.", "After reiterating that those legislative amendments had admittedly been a cause of delay in the context of the preliminary examination of the complaint, the General Court stated that the action taken in this regard by the Commission vis-à-vis the Danish authorities fell within its margin of discretion with reference to determining whether those amendments raised serious difficulties, without in itself establishing that the Commission encountered such difficulties in this case.", "13 Second, with regard to 3F’s argument that the Commission did not give any clear response on the meaning of ‘Community seafarers’ before the adoption of the contested decision, the General Court held, in paragraphs 84 and 85 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘the mere fact that no formal position was taken before the contested decision was adopted does not imply that the Commission encountered serious difficulties’ as to the assessment of the compatibility of the DIS scheme with the common market, since ‘the preliminary examination phase does not require an exchange of views and arguments with the complainant’ and ‘the Commission is not bound to state its position in this regard to the applicant before the adoption of the contested decision’.", "14 Third, 3F’s argument that the necessity of initiating a formal investigation procedure was confirmed by the Commission decisions concerning the French and Swedish tax schemes, decisions which at least implicitly raised the same question, was rejected by the General Court in paragraphs 87 and 88 of the judgment under appeal.", "It pointed out that the French and Swedish schemes were different from the Danish scheme at issue, and that the circumstances surrounding the preliminary examination stage in the case in point differed greatly from those in the French and Swedish cases since those schemes had been notified to the Commission and it was essentially a question of renewing the scheme already in force in Sweden and extending the French scheme.", "15 In paragraph 89 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court accordingly held as follows:", "‘It is apparent from the foregoing that none of the factors raised by [3F] allow the conclusion that, at the end of the preliminary examination procedure, the Commission encountered serious difficulties in this case, requiring the initiation of a formal investigation procedure.’", "16 In those circumstances, after stating, in paragraph 94 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘it follows from all of the foregoing that [3F] has not shown that the Commission was confronted with serious difficulties of assessment in classifying the measures at issue with regard to the concept of aid and establishing their compatibility with the common market’, the General Court, in paragraphs 95 and 96 of the judgment, concluded that the plea alleging infringement of Article 88(2) EC and of the principle of good administration was unfounded and therefore dismissed the action in its entirety .", "Forms of order sought before the Court of Justice", "17 3F claims that the Court should:", "– set aside the judgment under appeal;", "– give final judgment in the matter pursuant to Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice;", "– order the Commission to pay the costs.", "18 The Commission and the Kingdom of Denmark request the Court to dismiss the appeal and order 3F to pay the costs.", "The appeal", "19 In support of its appeal, 3F puts forward three pleas in law.", "By its first plea, it contends that the General Court erred in law in its interpretation and application of the case-law relating to the assessment of the length of a preliminary examination under Article 88(3) TFEU.", "The second plea alleges an error of law in the interpretation and application of the case-law on the meaning of ‘serious difficulties’ and on the determination of whether such difficulties exist.", "Finally, in its third plea 3F submits that the General Court erred in law by failing to respond to the plea relating to infringement of the principle of good administration or, in the alternative, by interpreting and applying the case-law on that principle incorrectly.", "The first plea", "Arguments of the parties", "20 By its first plea, 3F contends that the General Court erred in law in not requiring that the Commission show the existence of exceptional circumstances capable of justifying the extraordinarily long duration of the preliminary examination under Article 88(3) EC.", "21 According to 3F, it follows from the case-law relating to assessment of the duration of that examination, in particular from the judgment in Case T‑95/96 Gestevisión Telecinco v Commission [1998] ECR II‑3407, that a preliminary examination of extraordinary length requires that the Commission show exceptional circumstances justifying such a period.", "The General Court disregarded that case-law in concluding, in paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal, that the duration of the preliminary investigation in the present case was justified, without having found that the factors, mentioned in paragraph 59 of that judgment, upon which the Commission relied in order to explain the length of that examination represented such exceptional circumstances.", "22 The Commission submits that the fact that the length of the preliminary examination considerably exceeds what is normally required for an initial examination does not in itself suffice to show the existence of serious difficulties.", "The General Court was therefore right to hold, in paragraph 72 of the judgment under appeal, that it is only if it is reinforced by other factors that the passage of a period of time that seems excessive may lead to the conclusion that there were such difficulties.", "In so doing, the General Court did not disregard its case-law in the slightest.", "In order to determine whether the Commission encountered serious difficulties, the General Court consistently examines, when the duration of the preliminary examination considerably exceeds what is normally required for an initial examination, whether that duration may be regarded as reasonable in the light of the particular circumstances of each case (see, inter alia, Case T‑167/04 Asklepios Kliniken v Commission [2007] ECR II‑2379, paragraph 81).", "This is also the test applied in Gestevisión Telecinco v Commission.", "It is in this light that the General Court rightly concluded, in paragraphs 58 to 68 of the judgment under appeal, that the particular circumstances of the present case explain, to a large extent, the duration of the preliminary examination.", "23 The Kingdom of Denmark submits that the considerable amount of time taken by the Commission to examine the case before deciding not to initiate a formal investigation procedure was partly due to the fact that 3F repeatedly presented new information to the Commission.", "In any event, in the present instance there is nothing to suggest that the Commission, after thoroughly examining the DIS scheme for four years, was in doubt as to the scheme’s compatibility with the common market when it adopted the contested decision.", "Findings of the Court", "24 In examining the present plea, it should be noted first of all that Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [88] of the EC Treaty (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1) provides for a stage at which the aid measures notified undergo a preliminary examination, the purpose of which is to enable the Commission to form an initial view as to whether that aid is compatible with the common market.", "On completion of that stage, the Commission is to make a finding either that the measure does not constitute aid or that it falls within the scope of Article 87(1) EC.", "In the latter case, it may be that the measure does not raise doubts as to its compatibility with the common market; on the other hand, it is also possible that the measure may raise such doubts (judgment of 24 May 2011 in Case C‑83/09 P Commission v Kronoply and Kronotex, not yet published in the ECR, paragraph 43; order of 9 June 2011 in Case C‑451/10 P TF1 v Commission, paragraph 47; judgment of 22 September 2011 in Case C‑148/09 P Belgium v Deutsche Post and DHL International, not yet published in the ECR, paragraph 53; and judgment of 27 October 2011 in Case C‑47/10 P Austria v Scheucher-Fleisch and Others, not yet published in the ECR, paragraph 40).", "25 Where the Commission, after the preliminary examination, finds that no doubts are raised as to the compatibility with the common market of a notified measure in so far as it falls within the scope of Article 87(1) EC, it is to adopt a decision not to raise objections under Article 4(3) of Regulation No 659/1999 (Commission v Kronoply and Kronotex, paragraph 44; TF1 v Commission, paragraph 48; and Austria v Scheucher-Fleisch and Others, paragraph 41).", "26 Where the Commission adopts such a decision, it declares not only that the measure is compatible with the common market, but also – by implication – that it refuses to initiate the formal investigation procedure laid down in Article 88(2) EC and Article 6(1) of Regulation No 659/1999 (Commission v Kronoply and Kronotex, paragraph 45, and Austria v Scheucher-Fleisch and Others, paragraph 42).", "27 If, following the preliminary examination, it finds that the measure notified raises doubts as to its compatibility with the common market, the Commission is required to adopt, on the basis of Article 4(4) of Regulation No 659/1999, a decision initiating the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC and Article 6(1) of that regulation (Commission v Kronoply and Kronotex, paragraph 46; TF1 v Commission, paragraph 50; and Belgium v Deutsche Post and DHL International, paragraph 77).", "28 According to settled case-law, the procedure under Article 88(2) EC is essential whenever the Commission has serious difficulties in determining whether aid is compatible with the common market.", "The Commission may therefore restrict itself to the preliminary examination under Article 88(3) EC when taking a decision in favour of aid only if it is able to satisfy itself after an initial examination that the aid is compatible with the common market (see Case C‑431/07 P Bouygues and Bouygues Télécom v Commission [2009] ECR I‑2665, paragraph 61 and the case-law cited, and Austria v Scheucher-Fleisch and Others, paragraph 70).", "29 In the present instance, the contested decision is a decision founded on Article 4(3) of Regulation No 659/199 not to raise objections.", "The legality of that decision therefore depends on whether objectively doubts were raised as to the compatibility of the aid in question with the common market.", "30 Where an applicant seeks the annulment of a decision not to raise objections, he must prove the existence of doubts as to the aid’s compatibility (Commission v Kronoply and Kronotex, paragraph 59).", "31 That proof may be furnished by reference to a body of consistent evidence: the question whether or not a doubt exists requires investigation of both the circumstances in which the decision not to raise objections was adopted and its content, comparing the assessments upon which the Commission relied in that decision with the information available to it when it ruled on the compatibility of the aid in question with the common market (see, to that effect, Case C‑198/91 Cook v Commission [1993] ECR I‑2487, paragraphs 30 and 31; Bouygues and Bouygues Télécom v Commission, paragraph 63; TF1 v Commission, paragraph 52; and Austria v Scheucher-Fleisch and Others, paragraphs 71 and 72).", "32 It follows that, while the length of the preliminary examination procedure can constitute an indication that the Commission may have had doubts regarding the compatibility of the aid in question with the common market, its length cannot of itself lead to the conclusion that the Commission should have initiated the formal investigation procedure (see, to that effect, Case 84/82 Germany v Commission [1984] ECR 1451, paragraphs 14 to 17, and Belgium v Deutsche Post and DHL International, paragraph 81).", "33 By the present plea, 3F complains that the General Court concluded, in paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal, that the duration of the preliminary examination stage in this case, although it exceeded the time usually required for a preliminary examination, was justified to a large extent by the circumstances and context of the procedure, without having found that those factors represented exceptional circumstances.", "34 However, notwithstanding what it concluded in paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held in paragraph 69 of that judgment that the question in the case in point was, as 3F stated, not whether the duration of the preliminary examination was reasonable but whether there were serious difficulties such as to raise doubts regarding the compatibility of the aid.", "With regard to the latter question, the General Court held, in paragraph 70 of the judgment, that while the length of the preliminary examination did not of itself suffice to show the existence of serious difficulties, it could nevertheless constitute an indication of the existence of such difficulties.", "35 The General Court stated in this regard, in paragraph 72 of the judgment under appeal, that it is only if it is reinforced by other factors that the passage of time, even if that time considerably exceeds the time usually required for a preliminary examination under Article 88(3) EC, may lead to the conclusion that the Commission encountered serious difficulties.", "Consequently, the General Court examined, in paragraphs 73 to 89 of the judgment under appeal, whether the other factors relied upon by 3F relating to the circumstances of the preliminary examination procedure were such as to reinforce that indication of serious difficulties, before concluding, in paragraph 94 of the judgment, that ‘it follows from all of the foregoing that [3F] has not shown that the Commission was confronted with serious difficulties’.", "36 It is therefore apparent that, contrary to what 3F presupposes in the present plea, the General Court did not draw any factual or legal inference from the finding made in paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal concerning the duration of the preliminary examination stage being justified in the light of the circumstances and context of the procedure, but, on the contrary, examined whether the indication of the existence of doubts resulting from that stage’s duration, which prima facie was excessive in the present instance, was reinforced by other factors.", "37 Consequently, the first plea must be dismissed as ineffective.", "The second plea", "Arguments of the parties", "38 By its second plea, 3F contends that the General Court erred in law in its interpretation and application of the case-law on the meaning of ‘serious difficulties’ and on the determination of whether such difficulties exist.", "39 By the first part of this plea, 3F complains that the General Court found, in paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal, that the duration of the preliminary examination was justified, even if, considered as a whole, it could be regarded as exceeding the time usually required for a preliminary examination.", "First, contrary to what was held in paragraph 60 of that judgment, it is clear from the case-law, laid down inter alia in Asociación de Estaciones de Servicio de Madrid and Federación Catalana de Estaciones de Servicio v Commission, paragraphs 123 and 124, that the content of the initial complaint cannot justify a duration of over four years.", "Second, if, in accordance with the judgment in Case C‑367/95 P Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France [1998] ECR I‑1719, paragraphs 58 and 59, the Commission is not required, as the General Court observes in paragraph 84 of the judgment under appeal, to conduct an exchange of views and arguments with the complainant during the preliminary examination phase, the fact that it did so cannot justify its taking an unreasonably long time to conduct the preliminary examination procedure.", "40 3F further submits that the fact, noted by the General Court in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal, that the length of the preliminary examination does not of itself suffice to show the existence of serious difficulties cannot mean that the passage of time may be considered in isolation from the circumstances of the examination procedure and the content of the contested measure.", "The General Court has itself stated, in Case T‑388/03 Deutsche Post and DHL International v Commission [2009] ECR II‑199, paragraph 106, that where the procedure conducted by the Commission considerably exceeds what is normally required for an initial examination carried out pursuant to the provisions of Article 88(3) EC, that circumstance constitutes probative evidence of the existence of serious difficulties.", "41 By the second part of its second plea, 3F alleges that the General Court erred in law by examining separately, in paragraphs 74 to 88 of the judgment under appeal, the specific arguments advanced by 3F in this connection, without carrying out an overall assessment of all the circumstances relating to the preliminary examination stage.", "As is clear from the case-law of the General Court cited in paragraph 72 of the judgment under appeal, all the factors, including the circumstances and the length of the procedure, must be taken into account, which the General Court conspicuously failed to do.", "Moreover, when all those relevant factors are taken into account, the weight to be given to the length of the preliminary examination will be proportionate to that length.", "It will therefore be proportionately greater where the duration significantly exceeds the period normally required for a preliminary examination.", "42 The Commission submits on the first part of this plea that, as regards the content of the complaint, 3F fails to take into account that, in determining whether the duration of the preliminary examination stage is reasonable, account must be had of the particular circumstances of each case.", "Furthermore, 3F’s reasoning derived from the judgment in Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France fails to take account of the fact that, in particular, the Commission’s power to engage in a dialogue with the Member State concerned or third parties in an endeavour to overcome, at the preliminary examination stage, any difficulties encountered presupposes that the Commission may bring its position in line with the results of the dialogue it engaged in, without that alignment having to be interpreted, a priori, as establishing the existence of serious difficulties.", "43 In respect of the contention that the General Court erroneously considered the duration of the proceedings in isolation from the circumstances of the examination procedure and the content of the contested measure, the Commission observes that Deutsche Post and DHL International v Commission concerned a notified aid scheme, whereas the present case concerns a non-notified scheme, for which, according to Case C‑39/94 SFEI and Others [1996] ECR I‑3547, paragraph 48, the Commission is not required to carry out an initial investigation within a specified period of time.", "In any event, in Deutsche Post and DHL International v Commission the General Court did not hold that the length of the procedure may in and of itself indicate the existence of serious difficulties.", "44 So far as concerns the second part of the second plea, the Commission disputes the contention that the General Court failed to take account of all the factors, including the circumstances and the length of the procedure, in order to ascertain whether the Commission had been confronted with serious difficulties.", "It was only after having considered the factors explaining the length of the preliminary examination stage, in paragraphs 57 to 72 of the judgment under appeal, and all of the arguments advanced by 3F in relation to the circumstances of that preliminary examination procedure, in paragraphs 73 to 88 of the judgment, that the General Court concluded, in paragraph 89 of the judgment, that none of the factors raised by 3F allowed the conclusion that, at the end of the preliminary examination stage, the Commission encountered serious difficulties.", "The contention that the weight to be given to the length of the preliminary examination in the analysis of whether serious difficulties exist should be proportionate to that length has no basis in the case-law.", "45 The Kingdom of Denmark states that, since the DIS scheme was in conformity with the Commission’s relevant guidelines, there could not be any doubt as to the compatibility of that scheme. 3F could therefore legitimately expect the Commission not to initiate a formal examination procedure.", "Findings of the Court", "46 For the reasons already set out in paragraphs 33 to 36 of the present judgment, it is necessary at the outset to reject the first part of the second plea as ineffective in so far as it seeks to contest the finding made by the General Court in paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal that the duration of the preliminary examination stage is justified.", "47 As to the remainder, in so far as 3F seeks, by the first part of the second plea, to complain that the General Court examined the duration of the preliminary examination stage in isolation from the other circumstances of the contested decision’s adoption and from the content of the contested decision, it need merely be stated that, as already follows from paragraph 35 of the present judgment, 3F’s line of argument is founded on an incorrect reading of the judgment under appeal.", "It is clear from paragraphs 70 to 89 of that judgment that it was only after determining whether the indication of the existence of doubts resulting from the duration of the preliminary examination was reinforced by other factors relating to the circumstances that had surrounded the adoption of the contested decision that the General Court concluded, in paragraph 94 of the judgment, that 3F had not shown that the Commission was confronted with serious difficulties.", "Furthermore, having failed to advance before the General Court any argument relating to the content of the contested decision, 3F cannot complain that the General Court did not take that matter into account, since, as noted in paragraph 30 of the present judgment, it is for the applicant to prove the existence of serious difficulties such as to raise doubts.", "48 Consequently, the first part of the second plea must be rejected as partly ineffective and partly unfounded.", "49 The second part of this plea must be rejected as inadmissible in so far as 3F complains that the General Court examined separately each of the specific arguments advanced by it concerning the aforesaid circumstances.", "50 3F merely contends that the General Court should have carried out an overall assessment of those matters and does not set out in the slightest in what respect – inasmuch as it found, in its definitive assessment of the facts in paragraphs 73 to 89 of the judgment under appeal, that, in the circumstances of the present case, none of those matters taken individually enabled the existence of doubts regarding the compatibility of the aid in question to be established – the General Court is alleged to have erred in law by not carrying out an overall assessment of that kind.", "51 However, according to settled case-law, it follows from the second subparagraph of Article 256(1) TFEU, the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice and Articles 168(1)(d) and 169(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice that an appeal must indicate precisely the contested elements of the judgment which the appellant seeks to have set aside and also the legal arguments specifically advanced in support of the appeal (see, in particular, Case C‑352/98 P Bergaderm and Goupil v Commission [2000] ECR I‑5291, paragraph 34, and Case C‑240/03 P Comunità montana della Valnerina v Commission [2006] ECR I‑731, paragraph 105 and the case-law cited).", "52 This requirement is not satisfied by a plea which complains that the General Court reached a certain conclusion without specifying the legal basis on which it ought to have reached a different one (Case C‑257/98 P Lucaccioni v Commission [1999] ECR I‑5251, paragraph 62, and order of 26 January 2005 in Case C‑153/04 P Euroagri v Commission, paragraph 38).", "53 In so far as, by the second part of the second plea, 3F complains that the General Court did not give the duration of the preliminary examination stage a weight proportionate to its length, it must be acknowledged that the period of more than four years in the present instance between the lodging of 3F’s complaint and the Commission’s decision of approval significantly exceeds the time usually required for an initial examination at the preliminary examination stage.", "However, the fact remains that, in the present instance, the General Court held, in its definitive assessment of the facts, that the other factors advanced by 3F concerning the circumstances of the contested decision’s adoption were not such as to reinforce the indication of the existence of doubts which could result from the – prima facie excessive – duration of that stage.", "It should also be noted that in its action before the General Court 3F did not derive any argument from the content of the contested decision.", "54 As pointed out in paragraph 32 of the present judgment, the duration of the preliminary examination stage, contrary to what 3F suggests in this part of the second plea, cannot, whatever its length, demonstrate of itself the existence of doubts regarding the compatibility of the aid in question with the common market.", "55 In those circumstances, even if greater weight were required to be accorded to the duration of the preliminary examination stage where, as in the present case, it significantly exceeds the period normally required for a preliminary examination, the General Court did not err in law by not giving such weight to that matter.", "56 Therefore, the second part of the second plea must be rejected as partly inadmissible and partly unfounded.", "57 Consequently, the second plea must be dismissed.", "The third plea", "Arguments of the parties", "58 By its third plea, 3F complains that the General Court erred in law by failing to respond to the plea relating to infringement of the principle of good administration.", "The General Court is obliged to respond to all pleas raised by an applicant.", "However, paragraphs 57 to 85 of the judgment under appeal do not mention that principle, but relate solely to infringement of Article 88(2) EC.", "59 In the alternative, 3F submits that the General Court committed a number of errors of interpretation of the principle of good administration in paragraphs 53 to 94 of the judgment under appeal.", "First, for the reasons given in the context of the first and second pleas, the General Court was wrong in implicitly considering that the Commission’s examination in this case was diligent.", "Second, the General Court erred in law in that it failed to take into account that an administrative procedure of unreasonable duration infringes the general principle of good administration.", "The effect of such an infringement is to prejudice the rights of potentially interested third parties to comment, rights which would have been guaranteed had the Commission initiated a formal investigation procedure.", "Third, the General Court erred in law in not recognising that, in the circumstances described, in particular the length of the investigation, the Commission had de facto carried out a formal investigation but without respecting the rights of third parties within its framework.", "60 The Commission submits that, whatever the merits of the third plea, it follows from the case-law that, even if the need to conduct administrative procedures within a reasonable period is a general principle of European Union law, applicable in the context of an investigation procedure in respect of State aid and compliance with which is enforced by the European Union judicature, the mere adoption of a decision after the expiry of such a period is not in itself sufficient to render unlawful a decision taken by the Commission at the conclusion of an initial examination conducted under Article 88(3) EC.", "61 In any event, the Commission considers that 3F’s argument before the General Court concerning the principle of good administration was not clear and precise.", "62 Furthermore, so far as concerns the purported errors of interpretation of the principle of good administration, the Commission refers, in relation to the first alleged error, to the arguments set out by it in response to the first two pleas.", "In the case of the second alleged error, the Commission recalls that the mere adoption of a decision after the expiry of a reasonable period is not in itself sufficient to render it unlawful.", "Finally, as regards the third alleged error, the Commission submits that the length of the preliminary investigation can be explained, to a considerable extent, by the actions of 3F itself.", "Findings of the Court", "63 According to settled case-law, the obligation to state reasons owed by the General Court under Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, which applies to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of the Statute, and Article 81 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court requires it to disclose clearly and unequivocally the reasoning followed by it, in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for the decision taken and the Court of Justice to exercise its power of review (see, inter alia, Case C‑280/08 P Deutsche Telekom v Commission [2010] ECR I‑9555, paragraphs 135 and 136 and the case-law cited).", "64 However, the requirement that the General Court give reasons for its decisions cannot be interpreted as meaning that it is obliged to respond in detail to every single argument advanced by the applicant, particularly if the argument was not sufficiently clear and precise (see, inter alia, Joined Cases C‑120/06 P and C‑121/06 P FIAMM and Others v Council and Commission [2008] ECR I‑6513, paragraph 91 and the case-law cited).", "65 In this connection, it is to be recalled that it follows from the first paragraph of Article 21 of the Statute of the Court of Justice read in conjunction with Article 44(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court that the application initiating proceedings must contain, inter alia, a summary of the pleas in law on which it is based.", "66 In the present instance, it is apparent from 3F’s pleadings before the General Court that the line of argument put forward by it at first instance concerning infringement of the principle of good administration was not supported at all by separate considerations, but was linked exclusively to the line of argument concerning the alleged infringement of Article 88(2) EC.", "67 Thus, although, in the application initiating proceedings, the title of the first plea mentions the principle of good administration, paragraph 42 of the application, which concludes the line of argument concerning that plea, merely states that, ‘by failing to open the Article 88(2) [EC] procedure the Commission infringed that [provision] as applied by the case-law and the principle of good administration’, without explaining precisely in what respect the failure to open the formal investigation procedure constitutes an infringement of that principle.", "68 Likewise, in paragraph 15 of its reply before the General Court, 3F merely states, in respect of that principle, that the issue is whether, ‘having regard to the complexity of the issues, the time spent on these issues and the fact as the Commission now reveals other cases involved the same “important question of principle”, the Commission should have opened a formal investigation in which all Member States and interested parties could submit comments’.", "69 Furthermore, as is apparent from paragraph 69 of the judgment under appeal, in the same paragraph of the reply 3F itself stated that the question as to whether the duration of the preliminary examination was reasonable was not raised in the present case.", "70 Accordingly, since 3F did not set out in its action before the General Court any specific line of argument concerning infringement of the principle of good administration that was separate from the line of argument relating to infringement of Article 88(2) EC, the General Court cannot be reproached for having dismissed the plea alleging infringement of the principle of good administration without stating specific reasons in the judgment under appeal in that regard.", "71 Also, in so far as, by its arguments set out in the alternative, 3F now seeks to put forward separate and specific grounds to demonstrate that the Commission infringed the principle of good administration, essentially alleging that the duration of the preliminary examination stage was unreasonable, it is to be recalled that, according to Article 170(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, the subject-matter of the proceedings before the General Court may not be changed in the appeal.", "The Court of Justice’s jurisdiction in an appeal is confined to a review of the findings of law on the pleas argued before the General Court.", "A party may not, therefore, put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea which it could have raised before the General Court but has not raised, since to do so would be to allow it to bring before the Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction in appeals is limited, a case of wider ambit than that which came before the General Court (see judgment of 29 September 2011 in Case C‑520/09 P Arkema v Commission, not yet published in the ECR, paragraph 64 and the case-law cited).", "72 As to the remainder, in so far as, by these arguments advanced in the alternative, 3F alleges that the Commission infringed the principle of good administration because the formal investigation procedure was not initiated, suffice it to state that 3F merely repeats, without identifying the passages of the judgment under appeal that are supposedly wrong in law, the arguments put forward before the General Court.", "73 According to settled case-law, an appeal which merely repeats or reproduces verbatim the pleas in law and arguments submitted to the General Court, including those based on facts expressly rejected by that Court, does not satisfy the requirements to state reasons under the second subparagraph of Article 256(1) TFEU, the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice and Articles 168(1)(d) and 169(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, requirements which are recalled in paragraph 51 of the present judgment.", "Such an appeal amounts in reality to no more than a request for re-examination of the application submitted to the General Court, which the Court of Justice does not have jurisdiction to undertake (see, inter alia, Bergaderm and Goupil v Commission, paragraph 35, and Comunità montana della Valnerina v Commission, paragraph 106 and the case-law cited).", "74 Consequently, the third plea must be dismissed as partly inadmissible and partly unfounded.", "75 Having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.", "Costs", "76 In accordance with Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded the Court is to make a decision as to the costs.", "77 Under Article 138(1) of those Rules, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "Since the Commission has applied for costs and 3F has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay the costs of the present case.", "78 Under Article 140(1) of those Rules, Member States which have intervened in the proceedings are to bear their own costs.", "The Kingdom of Denmark must therefore be ordered to bear its own costs.", "On those grounds, the Court (Eighth Chamber) hereby:", "1.", "Dismisses the appeal;", "2.", "Orders Falles Fagligt Forbund (3F) to pay the costs;", "3.", "Orders the Kingdom of Denmark to bear its own costs.", "[Signatures]"], "doc_id":

realised.", "The transferring entities were immediately taxed on the remaining 15% of the capital gain at the normal rate of corporation tax.", "At the same time, that 15% could be offset as an increase in the value for tax purposes of the shares received in consideration for the contribution (in the accounting records of the transferring entities) or in the value for tax purposes of the

bring to an end, through the introduction of a common system of taxation, distortions of competition arising from national legislation and to facilitate reorganisation operations among companies in

scheme put in place in respect of banking companies by Article 7(2) of Law 218/1990 and by Article 4 of Legislative Decree 358/1997 in respect of the other undertakings did not constitute State aid ‘because the fiscal values of the assets exchanged remained unaltered, so that the fiscal gains did not materialise and no tax advantage was in conclusion granted. … The Commission therefore concludes that the tax neutrality was justified by the inherent logic of the tax system and does not constitute State aid’.", "38", "The Commission then concluded that the tax realignment schemes put in place by Laws 342/2000 and 448/2001 constituted general tax measures justified by the inherent logic of the system and did not therefore constitute State aid.", "The substitute tax did not provide any competitive advantage to the companies in question because it was applied under identical conditions to all companies, whether or not they were banking companies.", "39", "By contrast, the Commission held that the tax realignment scheme resulting from Article 2(26) of Law 350/2003 did not constitute a general measure because it applied exclusively to the capital gains realised by certain credit institutions, as a result solely of the reorganisations effected under Law 218/1990.", "The other credit institutions and the other companies concerned by the transactions implemented under Legislative Decree 358/1997 were not able to benefit from the same tax realignment scheme.", "40", "According to the Commission, the scheme provided for by Article 2(25) of Law 350/2003 ‘is not a tax realignment of values realigned following tax-neutral reorganisations but rather a tax revaluation scheme which [made it possible] to realise the [suspended] gains deriving from the adjustment of the [base] value of the assets held by the beneficiary companies to their current value’.", "The schemes provided for in Articles 2(25) and 2(26) of Law 350/2003 are, it submits, not equivalent in view of

218/1990 and that provided for by Law 358/1997 are equivalent, the Italian legislature should have applied the same tax realignment scheme in 2003.", "42", "According to the Commission, the tax advantage provided for in Article 2(26) of Law 350/2003 cannot be regarded as ‘de minimis’.", "43", "In terms of the justification relating to the nature of the tax scheme, the Commission held that the scheme applicable to the banking sector ‘does not represent an adaptation of the general system to the particular characteristics of the banking sector, but, rather, a selective advantage which has an impact on improving the competitiveness of certain undertakings’.", "44", "The Commission concluded from this that the scheme granted to certain credit institutions was a specific advantage which was not justified by the nature of the tax system.", "45", "In the light of all those considerations, the Commission decided that the derogating tax scheme implemented by the Italian Republic

responded to the second plea, finding that sufficient reasons were stated for the contested decision.", "As regards the first plea, it held that the Commission did not err in using the normal tax rate as a reference framework for the purpose of determining whether there was an economic advantage.", "It then held that the Commission correctly decided to compare the tax scheme at issue with the

proceedings in so far as BNP Paribas’ action was admissible.", "At the hearing, the Commission did not request the Court of Justice to reconsider this issue.", "The third ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "52", "By their third ground of appeal, which it is appropriate to examine first, the appellants criticise the General Court for having given ex novo reasons without any basis in the contested decision as regards determining the reference framework for the purpose of assessing whether the tax scheme at issue is selective.", "53", "First of all, they criticise the General Court for having analysed the characteristics of the general realignment scheme, for having compared it to the tax scheme at issue and for having decided that the two schemes had a different purpose.", "Not only did the Commission not carry out such an examination in the contested decision, but the General Court also erred by failing to recognise that the general realignment scheme also allowed gains realised following transfers of assets made under Law 218/1990 to be realigned.", "54", "The General Court distorted the facts by not taking into account the appellants’ arguments concerning a circular from the Italian Ministry of Finance and, incorrectly, declared inadmissible an item of evidence which they produced at the stage of the reply.", "55", "The Commission primarily takes the view that that ground is ineffective and unfounded.", "The reasons criticised by the appellants are given for the sake of completeness, since in paragraph 173 of the judgment under appeal the General Court clearly stated that the general realignment scheme was not the reference framework.", "Paragraph 185 of the judgment under appeal dealt with the tax scheme at issue and specified that the existence of other derogatory schemes does not call into question the finding that that scheme was derogatory in nature.", "56", "In the alternative, the Commission asserts that the general realignment scheme and the tax scheme at issue were not identical.", "Moreover, the fact that banking institutions to which assets were transferred under the scheme laid down by Law 218/1990 had the option to realign certain assets under the general realignment scheme and had made use of that option did not in any way alter the fact that the tax scheme at issue was reserved to them and was more favourable.", "Lastly, the contested decision limited recovery of the aid to the difference between the substitute tax reserved to banking institutions and that paid in respect of transactions under the general realignment scheme.", "Findings of the Court", "57", "It is apparent from the judgment under appeal and the documents included in the file that the appellants submitted before the General Court that, contrary to what the Commission stated in point 97 of the grounds of the contested decision, the normal tax rules for company profits could not be used as a valid basis for comparison and thus as a reference framework for the assessment of the selectivity of the tax scheme at issue.", "58", "The appellants then stated that, even if those rules were able to be used as a reference framework, the tax scheme at issue had not conferred any economic advantage on them.", "59", "The appellants lastly claimed that the general realignment scheme could not be used as a reference framework either, since its characteristics were totally different from those of the tax scheme at issue.", "Even if that were the case, the tax scheme at issue did not confer any economic advantage as against the general realignment scheme.", "60", "It is apparent from those submissions that, according to the appellants, neither the normal tax rules for profits nor the general realignment scheme could be used as a reference framework and that, even if that were the case, the tax scheme at issue did not confer any economic advantage as against one or other of those schemes.", "61", "In order to respond to those arguments, the General Court, in paragraph 161 of the judgment under appeal, first of all duly reiterated the Court of Justice’s case-law on the determination of the reference framework for the purpose of checking whether a measure is selective in the following terms:", "‘The Court of Justice has stated that the determination of the reference framework for the purpose of determining whether a measure is selective has a particular importance in the case of tax measures, since the very existence of an advantage may be established only when compared with “normal” taxation ([Case C-88/03] Portugal v Commission [[2006] ECR I-7115], paragraph 56), that is to say, the taxation normally applicable to undertakings which are, in the light of the objective pursued by the scheme in question, in a factual and legal situation that is comparable to that of the undertakings benefiting from the scheme ([Case C-143/99] Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke [[2001] ECR I-8365], paragraph 41).’", "62", "The General Court then, in paragraphs 165 to 167 of the judgment under appeal, made the following observations:", "‘165", "It is necessary, first, to consider the [appellants’] complaints relating to the Commission’s choice of normal [corporation] tax as the reference framework and the finding made by that institution, within that framework, that there was a selective economic advantage.", "166", "In the present case, the Commission found that, although the system of fiscal neutrality established by Law … 218/1990 resembled, as regards gains realised but not recognised, the system of fiscal neutrality under Article 4 of … Decree … 358/1997 [the second sentence of point 99 of the grounds of the contested decision] — a finding which dictated that any realignment scheme that may be introduced by the legislature should be applied without distinction, under the same conditions, to gains realised in the context of either of those two systems [point 88 of the grounds of the contested decision] — the Italian Republic had limited the benefit of the realignment scheme under Article 2(26) of Law … 350/2003 to undertakings reorganised under Law … 218/1990 [point 90 of the grounds of the contested decision].", "167", "On the basis of those considerations, the Commission concluded that the Italian Republic had conferred a selective advantage on those undertakings, corresponding to the difference between the tax actually paid pursuant to Article 2(26) of Law … 350/2003 and the normal tax that would have been paid if the realignment had taken place in the absence of the preferential scheme [point 91 of the grounds of the contested decision].’", "63", "In paragraphs 169 to 172 and paragraph 186 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court then responded to the appellants’ complaints as regards the Commission’s choice of using the normal tax rules for profits as a reference framework, and dismissed them in the following terms:", "‘169", "However, it is not for the Commission, in examining a scheme in the light of the rules on State aid, to envisage the subjective choices that might have been made by the beneficiaries of that scheme in the absence of such a scheme but to examine the scheme in order to determine whether it entails, from an objective standpoint, an economic advantage by reference to the tax provisions from which it derogates which would normally have been applicable in the absence of the scheme (see, to that effect, Case C-148/04 Unicredito Italiano [2005] ECR I-11137, paragraph 118).", "The fact that, in the absence of the realignment scheme at issue, the undertakings concerned would allegedly not have disposed of their assets is, in the context of such an objective assessment, irrelevant.", "170", "The [appellants] also claim … that the use of the normal tax as the reference framework is inappropriate because, whilst the application of the tax normally applied in the event of disposal would undoubtedly eliminate any misalignment of the assets for the establishment to which the assets were transferred under Law … 218/1990, it would, on the other hand, have no effect on the misalignment of the shares received by the transferring entity.", "171", "As regards the [appellants’] reference to the situation of the transferring entities under Law … 218/1990, it should be noted that the contested decision does not in any way concern those entities, but simply the banks to which assets were transferred under that law.", "The Commission considered in the contested decision whether there was an advantage, and concluded that that was the case, solely in connection with those banks.", "172", "It follows that the repeated references made by the [appellants] in the present action … to the situation of the transferring entities under Law … 218/1990, in particular to the fact that the 2003 tax reform did not remove for those entities the risk of the double taxation of suspended gains distributed as dividends, are irrelevant.", "...", "186", "It follows from the above considerations that, contrary to the [appellants’] claims, the Commission did not err in using the normal tax as a reference framework for the purpose of determining whether there was an economic advantage.’", "64", "Lastly, the General Court responded to the appellants’ complaints relating to the fact that the general realignment scheme could not be used as a reference framework, while observing, in paragraph 173 of the judgment under appeal, that the scheme set out in Article 2(25) of Law 350/2003 had not been chosen by the Commission as a reference framework, as follows:", "‘With regard to the [appellants’] argument that the realignment scheme under Article 2(25) of Law … 350/2003 was not, to any greater extent than the normal tax, a valid reference framework …, — which, moreover, contradicts the argument set out at paragraph 174 below — it is sufficient to point out that the Commission did not in the contested decision use the scheme established by Article 2(25) of Law … 350/2003 as a reference framework.’", "65", "The General Court then responded, in paragraphs 182 and 183 of the judgment under appeal, to the appellants’ arguments relating to the comparison between the tax scheme at issue and the other realignment schemes as follows:", "‘182", "In view of that difference in the objectives of the two realignment schemes, it was not necessary to compare realignment under Article 2(26) of Law … 350/2003 with realignment under Article 2(25) of that law.", "183", "The only measure with which realignment under Article 2(26) of Law … 350/2003 could have been compared was the realignment measure in Article 19 of Law … 342/2000, by which the legislature had extended the benefit of realignment under Article 17 of Law … 342/2000 to undertakings that had been reorganised under Article 4 of Legislative Decree … 358/1997.’", "66", "It is apparent from those considerations that, in contrast to what is stated in the ground of appeal, the General Court did not give reasons which were unrelated to the contested decision since, in paragraphs 165, 173 and 186 of the judgment under appeal, it observed that the reference framework chosen by the Commission was the normal tax rules for profits and it was only to respond to the appellants’ arguments that it compared the tax scheme at issue and the general realignment scheme.", "On that issue, the appellants state, in point 15 of their reply in the proceedings before the Court of Justice, that those arguments were not submitted in the alternative.", "It follows that the General Court was required to respond to them.", "67", "In addition, in paragraph 182 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held that there was no need to compare the tax scheme at issue with the general realignment scheme, which was exactly what the appellants had maintained in points 98 to 100 of their application initiating proceedings before the General Court and as they point out in point 77 of their appeal.", "It is thus apparent that the appellants have been successful and that they have no legal interest in challenging the judgment under appeal on that issue.", "68", "Concerning the complaints that the General Court distorted the facts regarding a circular from the Italian Ministry of Finance and that it incorrectly declared inadmissible an item of evidence which the appellants produced at the stage of the reply, it must be observed that the reasoning at issue was expounded by the General Court in response to the appellants’ arguments that the tax scheme at issue had not conferred any economic advantage on them in the light of the general realignment scheme.", "However, it is apparent from point 101 of the application submitted to the General Court that those arguments were made solely in the alternative, in the event that the General Court were to hold that the tax scheme at issue was comparable to the general realignment scheme.", "That was not the case, as stated in paragraph 66 of this judgment.", "69", "It follows from all those considerations that the third ground of appeal must be declared in part inadmissible and in part unfounded.", "The fourth ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "70", "The appellants criticise the General Court for having stated, in paragraph 193 of the judgment under appeal, that it was not important that the scheme for the transfer of assets under Law 218/1990 was made obligatory from the entry into force of Law 489/1993 since that scheme had been optional for the first three years it was applied.", "71", "The appellants consider this reasoning to be flawed.", "They submit that it was the obligatory nature of the scheme for the transfer of assets under Law 218/1990 which led the Italian tax legislature to put in place a tax realignment scheme with payment of a substitute tax.", "72", "The Commission contends that that ground of appeal is inadmissible because it asks the Court to examine the facts.", "In the alternative, the ground of appeal is unfounded, as the appellants are relying on unverified assumptions.", "Findings of the Court", "73", "Before the General Court, the appellants claimed that, even if the tax scheme at issue had conferred an economic advantage on them, that advantage was not selective.", "In support of that contention, they stated that the companies to which the tax scheme at issue was applied, that is to say, the companies to which assets had been transferred under Law 218/1990, were in a different legal situation from that of the other companies to which assets had been transferred.", "That difference stemmed from the fact, inter alia, that restructurings in the banking sector were not carried out spontaneously but on the basis of a recommendation and then, after the entry into force of Law 489/1993, an obligation.", "74", "In rejecting those arguments that there was a difference between the two categories of companies to which assets had been transferred, the General Court, in paragraph 193 of the judgment under appeal, made the following finding:", "‘Accordingly, with regard to the fact that the scheme established by Law … 218/1990 was mandatory and that public credit institutions were therefore under an obligation to transfer their banking assets to joint stock companies …, it is sufficient to point out that that obligation arose only in 1993 … Before that obligation was introduced, Law … 218/1990 already recognised that the transfer of assets under that law by public credit institutions was neutral for tax purposes.’", "75", "It is thus apparent that the General Court merely found that it had been possible for transfers of banking assets to joint stock companies under the system of fiscal neutrality to be carried out on a voluntary basis from the entry into force of Law 218/1990.", "Given those findings, the General Court was able to conclude that the appellants’ argument that the justification for the difference between the two categories of companies to which assets had been transferred resulted from the obligatory nature of the transfers of assets in the banking sector was irrelevant.", "76", "Consequently, the fourth ground of appeal is unfounded.", "The fifth ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "77", "The appellants criticise the General Court for having held, in paragraph 191 of the judgment under appeal, that the selectivity of the tax scheme at issue was proved by the fact that the Italian legislature had put in place, when drafting Law 342/2000, a uniform tax realignment scheme for the recognition of suspended gains arising as a result of company reorganisations under one or other of the systems of fiscal neutrality.", "78", "According to the appellants, it is apparent from the Court of Justice’s case-law that whether a tax measure is selective or not must be assessed in the light simply of its likely effects from a tax point of view and that the prior legal situation of the presumed beneficiary of the measure is not important.", "The General Court should not have relied on the situation prior to 2003.", "79", "The Commission primarily contends that that ground of appeal is inadmissible in so far as the Court is being requested to assess the national law, which is an issue of fact.", "As to the substance, the Commission submits that even if, for the purposes of the application of Article 107 TFEU, it is not important whether the situation of the beneficiary of the measure is improved or worsened in relation to the state of the law prior to that measure, that does not mean that the General Court should not take into account the fact that certain situations were treated identically in the past.", "Findings of the Court", "80", "As stated in paragraph 73 of this judgment, the appellants sought to establish that the companies to which assets had been transferred under Law 218/1990 were in a different legal situation from that of the other companies to which assets had been transferred.", "81", "In contrast to what is stated in the ground of appeal, the General Court, in paragraph 191 of the judgment under appeal, did not conclude that the tax scheme at issue was selective but merely held that the tax realignment schemes of those two categories of companies under Law 342/2000 were uniform.  addition, the General Court relied on other grounds in order to decide that the two categories of companies were not in different situations.", "82", "It follows that the fifth ground of appeal is unfounded.", "The first two grounds of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "83", "By the first ground of appeal, the appellants criticise the General Court for having approved, immediately and without examining whether it was well founded, the Commission’s position according to which the transferring entities did not fall within the scope of the contested decision.", "They state that they claimed before the General Court that the tax scheme at issue was consistent with the inherent logic of the Italian tax system and that the companies to which assets had been transferred under Law 218/1990 were in a specific situation which was different from that of the companies to which assets had been transferred under Article 4 of Legislative Decree 358/1997.", "84", "The appellants state that they had stressed that there was no inequality of treatment between the companies in the two categories.", "The tax misalignment scheme provided for in Article 4 of Legislative Decree 358/1997 could not lead to double taxation after the adoption of Legislative Decree 344/2003, which was not true of the scheme for capital gains accruing following transfers of assets under Law 218/1990.", "85", "In the second ground of appeal, the appellants state that they claimed before the General Court that the application of the tax scheme at issue only to companies and entities which had transferred assets under the system of fiscal neutrality established by Law 218/1990 was justified by the nature of the Italian tax system.", "At the time of the adoption of Law 350/2003, those companies and entities were the only ones at risk of double taxation of the capital gains relating to those transfers and the tax scheme at issue aimed specifically to neutralise that risk.", "86", "They submit that the General Court rejected those arguments solely on the basis that the contested decision concerned only companies to which assets had been transferred under Law 218/1990 and not the transferring entities.", "Thus, the General Court did not examine in sufficient depth whether the tax scheme at issue was justified by the nature and overall structure of the Italian tax system or whether it resulted directly from the founding or guiding principles of that tax system.", "The reasons stated for the contested decision are therefore inadequate.", "Moreover, the assessment of whether a State measure is selective or not should be carried out in the light of the objective pursued by it.", "87", "According to the appellants, the tax realignment schemes providing for the payment of a substitute tax did not only have the aim of tax realignment, but also sought to ensure that capital gains were only taxed once.", "Consequently, the realignment schemes were justified only if the companies and entities which had transferred assets were at risk of double taxation.", "88", "That risk of double taxation disappeared in the case of companies which had transferred assets under Legislative Decree 358/1997 on the introduction of the ‘shareholding exemption’ scheme by a tax reform which entered into force with Legislative Decree 344/2003.", "As a result of the ‘shareholding exemption’ scheme, the system of fiscal neutrality put in place by Legislative Decree 358/1997 no longer gave rise to a risk of double taxation, but a single taxation of solely the recipient company.", "However, that risk continued to exist in respect of companies and entities which had transferred assets under Law 218/1990.", "That is why the tax realignment scheme was extended for those companies and entities.", "89", "Contrary to the Commission’s submissions, Article 19 of Law 342/2000, in referring to Article 17 of that law, included the situation of companies to which assets had been transferred under Legislative Decree 358/1997 and also that of companies transferring assets.", "That is apparent from the actual wording of Article 17.", "The omission of a reference to Article 18 of Law 342/2000 means only that the transferring companies could not choose to pay of their own accord the higher value of the shareholding recorded following the transfer.", "Lastly, Article 18 concerned only companies which had carried out transfers and not transferring entities that were not in the legal form of a company.", "90", "As regards the first ground of appeal, the Commission submits, as a preliminary point, that the entities which had transferred assets under Law 218/1990 have become banking foundations, which are neither credit institutions nor, in the majority of cases, undertakings, and which are not subject to the rules on State aid.", "They are subject to a tax system which is different from that of companies.", "Moreover, those banking foundations have no further link with the recipient companies.", "91", "The General Court was correct to state that the contested decision did not concern those entities and that the fact that they may be taxed because of a risk of double taxation was not a fact such as to justify the grant of a selective advantage to the recipient companies.", "The General Court thus fully exercised its power of review.", "92", "Furthermore, the appellants have not proved justification by the nature and overall structure of the Italian tax system.", "In any event, the Court of Justice could substitute its own grounds or reject, on the substance, the argument that the selectivity of the measure is justified by the nature and overall structure of the system.", "93", "As regards the second ground of appeal, the Commission contends primarily that it is inadmissible.", "The appellants merely repeat their arguments at first instance without identifying the error of law allegedly committed by the General Court.", "The issues relating to national law constitute issues of fact in respect of which the General Court has exclusive jurisdiction.", "In the context of an appeal, a claim alleging an incorrect assessment of national law is thus inadmissible, unless that law has been fundamentally misread.", "94", "In the alternative, the Commission claims that the second ground of appeal should be rejected.", "First, concerning the issue of whether the selectivity of the tax scheme at issue could have been justified by the inherent logic of the system, it disputes the appellants’ contention that the selective nature of a State measure must be evaluated having regard to that measure’s objective.", "That contention is contrary to the Court of Justice’s case-law.", "Moreover, the General Court did not merely state that the transferring entities were not concerned by the contested decision, but also pointed out that the fact that they might be taxed does not justify the recipient companies being granted an advantage.", "95", "Furthermore, it submits that companies transferring assets in transactions other than those under Law 218/1990 never benefited from the tax realignment scheme.", "Article 19 of Law 342/2000 stated that the provisions of Article 17 of that law applied to companies to which assets had been transferred under Legislative Decree 358/1997.", "No reference was made to the provisions of Article 18 of that law, which related to transferring entities.", "Findings of the Court", "96", "By these grounds of appeal, the appellants criticise the General Court for not having exercised its power of review to examine whether the tax scheme at issue was justified by the nature and general scheme of the Italian tax system.", "97", "It is apparent from paragraphs 124 to 130 and from paragraph 200 of the judgment under appeal that the appellants submitted that the tax scheme established in Articles 17 and 18 of Law 342/2000 was extended only in respect of companies and entities which took part in transfers of assets in exchange for shares under the system of fiscal neutrality provided for in Article 7(2) of Law 218/1990.", "They argued that, following the entry into force of Legislative Decree 344/2003 and the establishment of the special exemption regime known as ‘shareholding exemption’, the risk of double taxation disappeared for the companies and entities which carried out such transactions under the system of fiscal neutrality provided for in Article 4 of Legislative Decree 358/1997.", "98", "The Commission contended, as set out in paragraphs 150 to 152 of the judgment under appeal, that the entities which had transferred assets in transactions carried out under the scheme laid down by Law 218/1990 were no longer credit institutions and that, in the majority of cases, they were no longer undertakings.", "In respect of the risk of double taxation, the Commission observed that the entities which had transferred assets in transactions carried out under Legislative Decree 358/1997 had never benefited from the tax realignment scheme set out in Article 18 of Law 342/2000.", "99", "The General Court responded to that line of argument in paragraphs 199 to 202 of the judgment under appeal as follows:", "‘199", "Next, it is necessary to consider the [appellants’] complaint … alleging that the Commission was wrong to consider that the selective nature of the scheme established by Article 2(26) of Law … 350/2003 could not be justified by the inherent logic of the system.", "200", "In that context, the applicants submit essentially … that the 2003 tax reform eliminated any risk of the double taxation of the gains arising on the transfer of assets under the system of fiscal neutrality established by Article 4 of Legislative Decree … 358/1997, namely the taxation of both the companies transferring and the companies in receipt of assets.", "On the other hand, that reform did not remove the risk of the double taxation of the gains arising in connection with the transfer of assets under the system of fiscal neutrality introduced by Law … 218/1990.", "The [appellants] maintain that that explains the decision of the Italian legislature to extend the realignment scheme under Articles 17 and 18 of Law … 342/2000 only to assets transferred in the context of Law … 218/1990.", "201", "However, it should be recalled that the contested decision does not concern transferring entities but only banking establishments to which assets were transferred under Law … 218/1990 and the economic advantage reserved to those establishments by the scheme at issue.", "Consequently, the fact that the transferring entities under Law … 218/1990 might have been taxed because there was a possibility of double taxation cannot be a factor that justifies a selective advantage being conferred on recipient banks by means of Article 2(26) of Law … 350/2003.", "202", "The Commission was therefore correct to consider, at recital 105 in the preamble to the contested decision, that the scheme introduced by Article 2(26) of Law … 350/2003 conferred a selective advantage which had the effect of improving the competitiveness of credit institutions which were reorganised under Law … 218/1990 by comparison with other undertakings.’", "100", "According to the Court’s case-law, however, State aid, as defined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is a legal concept which must be interpreted on the basis of objective factors.", "For that reason, the European Union judicature must in principle and having regard both to the specific features of the case before it and to the technical or complex nature of the Commission’s assessments, carry out a comprehensive review as to whether a measure falls within the scope of Article 107(1) TFEU (see, inter alia, Case C-83/98 P France v Ladbroke Racing and Commission [2000] ECR I-3271, paragraph 25, and Case C-487/06 P British Aggregates v Commission [2008] ECR I-10515, paragraph 111).", "101", "Moreover, according to equally well-established case-law,the concept of State aid does not refer to State measures which differentiate between undertakings and which are, therefore, prima facie selective where that differentiation arises from the nature or the general scheme of the system of which they form part (see to that effect, inter alia, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke, paragraph 42; Portugal v Commission, paragraph 52; British Aggregates v Commission, paragraph 83; and Joined Cases C-106/09 P and C-107/09 P Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom [2011] ECR I-11113, paragraph 145).", "102", "It is apparent from those considerations that, in carrying out the necessary comprehensive review of the characterisation of the tax scheme at issue as State aid, the General Court had to examine whether the differentiation between undertakings arising from that scheme was due to the nature or general scheme of the tax system of which it formed part. 103", "Admittedly, the Court of Justice has held that judicial review is limited with regard to whether a measure comes within the scope of Article 107(1) TFEU, in a case where the appraisals by the Commission are technical or complex in nature (see, inter alia, France v Ladbroke Racing and Commission, paragraph 25, and British Aggregates v Commission, paragraph 114).", "However, the General Court did not find that this was the case here.", "104", "Thus, by merely observing that the contested decision did not concern the transferring entities without considering the tax realignment scheme in its entirety, and without having assessed the appellants’ and the Commission’s arguments, the General Court erred in law by failing to carry out a comprehensive review as to whether the tax scheme at issue came within the scope of Article 107(1) TFEU (see, to that effect, British Aggregates v Commission, paragraph 115).", "105", "The judgment under appeal must therefore be set aside to the extent that it infringed Article 107(1) TFEU.", "The action before the General Court", "106", "Pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the Court quashes the decision of the General Court it may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits.", "107", "In the present case, the state of the proceedings is such that judgment can be given on that point and it is necessary to examine the plea put forward at first instance by the appellants, alleging that the tax scheme at issue was justified by the nature and general scheme of the Italian tax system, in order to ascertain whether the forms of order sought at first instance by the appellants may be granted.", "Arguments of the parties", "108", "The appellants claimed that the extension of the realignment scheme reserved to companies to which assets had been transferred under Law 218/1990 could not confer any selective advantage on those companies in relation to the normal rules for the taxation of profits since that special treatment was justified by the structure of the Italian tax system.", "109", "First, according to the appellants, the reform of corporation tax, which entered into force with Legislative Decree 344/2003, removed any risk of economic double taxation of gains arising on the transfer of assets pursuant to Article 4 of Legislative Decree 358/1997.", "More specifically, there was no longer a risk that transferring companies would be taxed on those gains as a gain on the shares received in consideration for the assets transferred, and that the recipient companies would be taxed on those gains as a gain on the assets transferred.", "110", "The ‘shareholding exemption’ scheme exempted 95% of the gains accruing on the disposal of shares, including in respect of shares received in exchange for transfers of assets carried out under the system of fiscal neutrality established in Article 4 of Legislative Decree 358/1997.", "111", "By contrast, the reform of corporation tax did not eliminate that risk of double taxation of the gains accruing from assets transferred under Article 7 of Law 218/1990.", "The transferring entities which had disposed of all their assets could therefore no longer be characterised as trading organisations and could not benefit from the ‘shareholding exemption’ scheme.", "Furthermore, those entities remained subject to corporation tax in respect of the reserve to which they had appropriated the difference between the book value of the shares received and their cost for tax purposes if they distributed that reserve to their members.", "112", "The decision to extend the tax realignment scheme only for companies to which assets had been transferred under Law 218/1990 can be explained by the fact that only under that scheme was it still possible for gains to be liable to double taxation after the entry into force of the reform of corporation tax.", "The tax scheme at issue was necessary to allow recipient companies to exit the system of fiscal neutrality.", "113", "Secondly, the appellants claimed that the differences in the rates of substitute tax laid down in Article 2(25) of Law 350/2003 and in the tax scheme at issue respectively were justified by different origin of the misalignments between the book values and the values for tax purposes, which could be eliminated under each of those two schemes.", "114", "The realignment scheme for transfers of assets made under the scheme established by Law 218/1990 only enabled misalignments arising from a system of partial fiscal neutrality to be eliminated whereas under the general realignment scheme all misalignments could be eliminated.", "The rate of tax was fixed to take into account the fact that the transfers of assets had given rise to the payment of a tax of 15% on the gain realised during that transaction.", "The application of a higher rate of tax in the general realignment scheme than in the tax scheme at issue is balanced out by the fact that those which benefited from the former scheme did not need to pay the tax which those which benefited from the latter scheme paid.", "By retaining the realignment scheme for the benefit of solely the recipient companies, the Italian Government clearly showed that it did not consider the situation of those companies to be equivalent.", "115", "The Commission submits that the contested decision does not concern entities which transferred assets under Law 218/1990 and which have become banking foundations.", "In the majority of cases, they are entities which are not subject to the State aid rules.", "116", "So far as concerns the effects of the entry into force of the reform of corporation tax, the Commission points out that the companies which transferred assets under the scheme referred to in Article 4 of Legislative Decree 358/1997 never benefited from the tax realignment scheme provided for in Article 18 of Law 342/2000 and reserved to those entities.", "117", "According to the Commission, it is illogical to consider in the same way the tax treatment applicable to two subjects between which there is no further link, as is the case with banking foundations, or of which one holds only a minority shareholding in the capital of the other.", "118", "As regards the comparison between the tax scheme at issue and the general realignment scheme, the appellants’ arguments are contrived and unfounded.", "Under Article 19 of Law 342/2000, the tax rates for realignments carried out in respect of transfers of assets pursuant to Article 4 of Legislative Decree 358/1997 and those laid down for the purposes of realignments carried out in respect of transfers of assets under the scheme established by Law 218/1990 were identical for a number of years, from which it follows that the reduced rate is not justified by the taxation of the capital gain at the rate of 15% when the transfer under the latter scheme was made.", "119", "Lastly, the Commission states that the realignments are opportunities offered and not obligations, and therefore are not a necessary complement to the misalignment schemes.", "Findings of the Court", "120", "As set out in paragraph 101 of this judgment, the concept of State aid does not refer to State measures which differentiate between undertakings and which are, therefore, prima facie selective where that differentiation arises from the nature or the general scheme of the system of which they form part.", "121", "It is for the Member State which has introduced such a differentiation between undertakings in relation to charges to show that it is actually justified by the nature and general scheme of the system in question (Case C-159/01 Netherlands v Commission [2004] ECR I-4461, paragraph 43; C-279/08 P Commission v Netherlands [2011] ECR I-7671, paragraph 77; and Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, paragraph 146).", "122", "It is apparent from points 62 and 106 of the grounds of the contested decision that the Italian Government argued during the administrative procedure that the tax scheme at issue was a mere repetition of the scheme enacted under Law 342/2000, which did not involve State aid as it applied to realised gains deriving from all company restructurings.", "123", "According to that government, the scheme provided for in Article 2(25) of Law 350/2003 generalised the opportunity to realign the values for tax purposes by its implied reference to Article 14 of Law 342/2000, which concerned all misalignments arising from company reorganisations implemented under Legislative Decree 358/1997.", "124", "In points 68 and 69 of the grounds of the contested decision, it is explained that, according to the Italian Government, the application, on the one hand, of Article 2(25) of Law 350/2003 and, on the other hand, of the tax scheme at issue resulted in a taxation of capital gains which was practically identical.", "125", "Points 64 to 66 of the grounds of the contested decision also show that the Italian Government took the view that the realignment scheme provided for following transfers of assets in exchange for shares carried out in the context of the restructuring of the banking sector implemented by Law 218/1990 was justified by the very nature of those transactions and by the fact that the fiscal neutrality provided for in respect of those reorganisations was only partial.", "The system of partial fiscal neutrality was justified by the desire to facilitate the privatisation of certain credit institutions while avoiding granting them unnecessary advantages.", "126", "It follows, first, that during the administrative procedure the Italian Government justified the system of partial neutrality or partial tax misalignment put in place by Law 218/1990 by the specific nature of that system and, secondly, that Law 350/2003 generalised the opportunity to realign the values for tax purposes of the assets transferred and the shares received in exchange for the payment of a substitute tax on the gains accruing from that realignment.", "127", "It is also apparent from an examination of the Italian legislation that two different systems of fiscal neutrality in respect of gains realised following transfers of assets between companies were successively put in place, one in the context of the restructuring of the banking sector and the other in the context of transfers of assets in exchange for shares carried out between other companies.", "128", "Subsequently, the Italian legislature introduced, by Legislative Decree No 41 of 23 February 1995, cited in paragraph 17 of this judgment, a tax realignment scheme solely for gains accruing from transfers of assets in exchange for shares carried out in the context of the restructuring of the banking sector.", "129", "Article 17 of Law 342/2000 provided for the opportunity, for companies to which assets had been transferred following transactions carried out under Law 218/1990, to realign the value for tax purposes of those contributions provided they paid a substitute tax with different rates depending on whether they were realigning the value for tax purposes of the assets and the shares, or simply realigning the value for tax purposes of the assets.", "The same scheme was applicable, under Article 19 of that law, to all companies to which assets had been transferred in exchange for shares under the system of fiscal neutrality established by Legislative Decree 358/1997.", "130", "Consequently, in adopting Law 342/2000, the Italian legislature intended to put in place a single scheme for the realignment of the value of assets for tax purposes, regardless of in what context the transfer took place.", "That single realignment scheme was extended pursuant to Article 3(11) of Law 448/2001.", "131", "In point 89 of the grounds of the contested decision, the Commission acknowledged that those realignment schemes provided for in Laws 342/2000 and 448/2001, which allowed the gains realised to be recognised by payment of a substitute tax set at the same level for all the undertakings concerned, were, upon analysis, general tax measures justified by the inherent logic of the Italian tax system.", "132", "However, Law 350/2003 extended only the scheme established by Article 17 of Law 342/2000 and not that established by Article 19 of that law.", "It follows that only the companies to which assets had been transferred following transactions carried out under Law 218/1990 were able to continue to realign the value for tax purposes of those assets with their book value by payment of a substitute tax.", "The other companies to which assets had been transferred under the system of fiscal neutrality established by Article 4 of Legislative Decree 358/1997 could no longer realign the values for tax purposes of those assets by payment of that tax.", "133", "As mentioned in paragraphs 123 and 124 of this judgment, the Italian Government stated, during the administrative procedure, that Article 2(25) of Law 350/2003 generalised the opportunity to realign the values for tax purposes by its implied reference to Article 14 of Law 342/2000 and that the tax paid pursuant to that provision was practically equivalent to that paid pursuant to the tax scheme at issue.", "134", "It must, however, be stated that the scheme set out in Article 14 existed at the same time as that referred to in Articles 17 and 19 of Law 342/2000 and it cannot therefore be seen as the extension of the scheme established by Article 19.", "The scheme provided for in Article 14 of Law 342/2000 is not equivalent to that stemming from Article 17 of that law since it is only aimed at the realignment of certain assets and the difference between the rates of tax on the gains under Article 14 depends on whether or not the revalued asset is depreciable and not on whether the realignment affects only assets or assets and shares, as set out in Article 17.", "135", "The appellants submit that the continuance, by the tax scheme at issue, of the scheme established by Article 17 of Law 342/2000, which benefited only the companies to which assets had been transferred under the scheme established by Law 218/1990, is linked to the fact that, from the entry into force of the tax reform established by Legislative Decree 344/2003 and the ‘shareholding exemption’ scheme put in place by that reform, there was no longer any risk of double taxation of gains following transfers of assets in exchange for shares carried out under the system of fiscal neutrality established by Legislative Decree 358/1997.", "This was because the transferring companies which had received shares in exchange were exempt from tax on 95% of the gains accruing following disposals of shares.", "136", "Nevertheless, it is apparent from points 66 to 68 of the grounds of the contested decision that the Italian Government justified the tax scheme at issue by stating that it was the necessary complement of the system of partial fiscal neutrality established by Law 218/1990 and that it gave rise to taxation which was practically identical to that following from the application of Article 2(25) of Law 350/2000.", "The explanations provided by that government do not show that the failure to extend the scheme provided for in Article 19 of Law 342/2000 is attributable to the fact that the companies which had transferred assets under the scheme laid down in Legislative Decree 358/1997 benefited thereafter from the ‘shareholding exemption’ scheme, whereas the companies and entities which had transferred assets in exchange for shares under Law 218/1990 were taxed, upon realignment, in the case of both the transferring entity and the recipient company.", "137", "Thus the tax scheme at issue, which the Italian Government acknowledged conferred a tax advantage on companies to which assets had been transferred under Law 218/1990, does not appear to be justified by the inherent logic of the Italian tax system.", "138", "The plea alleging that the tax scheme at issue is justified by the inherent logic of the Italian tax scheme must be rejected.", "139", "Consequently, the action must be dismissed.", "Costs", "140", "Under the first paragraph of Article 122 of the Rules of Procedure, where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, it is to make a decision as to costs.", "Under Article 69(2) of those rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 118 thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "141", "In the present case, since the appeal of BNP Paribas and BNL was upheld in part, it is appropriate to rule that both BNP Paribas and BNL and the Commission are to bear the costs which they have incurred before the Court.", "142", "Moreover, since the appellants’ action against the contested decision was unfounded and the Commission has applied for costs, BNP Paribas and BNL must be ordered to pay the costs incurred before the General Court.", "On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby:", "1.", "Sets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 1 July 2010

T‑50/06 RENV, T‑56/06 RENV, T‑60/06 RENV, T‑62/06 RENV and T‑69/06 RENV Ireland and Others v Commission [2012] ECR (‘the judgment under appeal’), whereby the General Court annulled Commission Decision 2006/323/EC of 7 December 2005 concerning the exemption from excise duty on mineral oils used as fuel for alumina production in Gardanne, in the Shannon region and in Sardinia respectively implemented by France, Ireland and Italy (OJ 2006 L 119, p. 12, ‘the contested decision’), in so far as that decision finds, or is based on the finding, that the exemptions from excise duty on mineral oils used as fuel for alumina production granted by the French Republic, Ireland and the Italian Republic until 31 December 2003 constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC and in so far as it orders the French Republic, Ireland and the Italian Republic to take all measures necessary to recover those exemptions from the beneficiaries to the extent that the latter did not pay excise duty at the rate of at least EUR 13.01 per 1000 kg of heavy fuel oils.", "Legal context", "2", "Excise duty on mineral oils has been the subject of a number of directives, namely Council Directive 92/81/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on mineral oils (OJ 1992 L 316, p. 12), Council Directive 92/82/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of the rates of excise duties on mineral oils (OJ 1992 L 316, p. 19) and Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity (OJ 2003 L 283, p. 51), which repealed Directives 92/81 and 92/82 with effect from 31 December 2003.", "3", "Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81 provided:", "‘The Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorise any Member State to introduce further exemptions or reductions for specific policy considerations.", "A Member State wishing to introduce such a measure shall accordingly inform the Commission and shall also provide the Commission with all relevant or necessary information.", "The Commission shall inform the other Member States of the proposed measure within one month.", "The Council shall be deemed to have authorised the exemption or reduction proposed if, within two months of the other Member States’ being informed as laid down in the second subparagraph, neither the Commission nor any Member State has requested that the matter be considered by the Council.’", "4", "Under Article 8(5) of that directive:", "‘If the Commission considers that the exemptions or reductions provided for in paragraph 4 are no longer sustainable, particularly in terms of fair competition or distortion of the operation of the internal market, or Community policy in the area of protection of the environment, it shall submit appropriate proposals to the Council.", "The Council shall take a unanimous decision on these proposals.’", "5", "Article 6 of Directive 92/82 fixed the minimum rate of excise duty on heavy fuel oil, as from 1 January 1993, at EUR 13 per 1000 kg.", "6", "The second indent of Article 2(4)(b) of Directive 2003/96 provided that that directive did not apply to dual use of energy products, that is to say where products are used both as heating fuel and for purposes other than as motor fuel and heating fuel.", "The use of energy products for chemical reduction and in electrolytic and metallurgical processes is to be regarded as dual use.", "Hence, since 1 January 2004, when that directive became applicable, there has no longer been any minimum excise duty for heavy fuel used in the production of alumina.", "Moreover, under Article 18(1) of Directive 2003/96, the Member States were authorised to continue to apply, until 31 December 2006, the reduced rates or exemptions set out in Annex II to that directive, which refers to the excise duty exemptions for heavy fuel oil used as fuel for the production of alumina in the region of Gardanne, in the Shannon region and in Sardinia.", "Background to the dispute", "7", "Ireland, the Italian Republic and the French Republic have exempted from excise duty mineral oils used for the production of alumina, respectively in the Shannon region since 1983, in Sardinia since 1993 and in the Gardanne region since 1997.", "8", "Those exemptions (‘the exemptions at issue’) were authorised, respectively, by Council Decision 92/510/EEC of 19 October 1992 authorising Member States to continue to apply to certain mineral oils, when used for specific purposes, existing reduced rates of excise duty or exemptions from excise duty, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81 (OJ 1992 L 316, p. 16); by Council Decision 93/697/EC of 13 December 1993 authorising certain Member States to apply or to continue to apply to certain mineral oils, when used for specific purposes, reduced rates of excise duty or exemptions from excise duty, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81 (OJ 1993 L 321, p. 29), and by Council Decision 97/425/EC of 30 June 1997 authorising Member States to apply and

concerning reduced rates of excise duty and exemptions from such duty on certain mineral oils when used for specific purposes (OJ 2001 L 84, p. 23), extended until 31 December 2006.", "9", "Recital 5 in the preamble to Decision 2001/224 stated that that decision was without prejudice ‘to the outcome of any procedures relating to distortions of the operation of the single market that may be undertaken, in particular under Articles [87 EC] and [88 EC]’, and that it did not override ‘the requirement for Member States to notify instances of potential State aid to the Commission under Article [88 EC]’.", "10", "By three decisions of 30 October 2001, the Commission initiated the procedure provided for in Article 88(2) EC with regard to each of the exemptions at issue.", "On completion of that procedure, the Commission adopted the decision at issue, according to which:", "—", "the exemptions from excise duty granted by Ireland, the French Republic and the Italian Republic in respect of heavy fuel oils used in the production of alumina until 31 December 2003 constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC;", "—", "aid granted between 17 July 1990 and 2 February 2002, to the extent that it is incompatible with the common market, is not to be recovered as this would be contrary to the general principles of Community law;", "—", "the aid granted between 3 February 2002 and 31 December 2003 is incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 87(3) EC insofar as the beneficiaries did not pay a rate of at least EUR 13.01 per 1000 kg of heavy fuel oils, and", "—", "the latter aid must be recovered.", "11", "In the contested decision, the Commission held that the exemptions at issue constituted new aid and not existing aid within the meaning of Article 1(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [88 EC] (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1).", "It based that assessment on the fact, in particular, that the exemptions at issue did not exist before the entry into force of the EC Treaty in the Member States concerned, that they had never been analysed or authorised on the basis of the State aid rules, and that they had never been notified.", "12", "After setting out how the aid at issue was incompatible with the common market, the Commission took the view that, having regard to the Council decisions authorising the exemptions at issue (‘the authorisation decisions’) and in the light of the fact that those decisions had been adopted on proposals by the Commission, the recovery of incompatible aid granted before 2 February 2002, the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities of the decisions to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) EC, would be contrary to the principles of protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty.", "The procedure and the judgment under appeal", "13", "By applications lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 16, 17 and 23 February 2006, the Italian Republic, Ireland, the French Republic, Eurallumina SpA (‘Eurallumina’) and Aughinish Alumina Ltd (‘AAL’) brought proceedings for the annulment, in whole or in part, of the contested decision.", "14", "By judgment of 12 December 2007 in Joined Cases T‑50/06, T‑56/06, T‑60/06, T‑62/06 and T‑69/06 Ireland and Others v Commission, the General Court annulled the contested decision.", "The Court, by judgment of 2 December 2009 in Case C-89/08 P Commission v Ireland and Others [2009] ECR I-11245, to which reference is made for a fuller account of the earlier procedure, set aside that judgment in so far as it annulled the contested decision on the ground that, in that decision, the Commission failed to fulfil its obligation to state reasons with regard to the non-application in the case of Article 1(b)(v) of Regulation No 659/1999.", "15", "The cases were referred back to the General Court, where they were then joined for the purposes of the written and oral procedure and the final judgment.", "16", "In order to annul the contested decision a second time, the General Court, in the judgment under appeal, upheld the pleas or grounds of complaint put forward by some or all of the parties, relating to the infringement of the principles of legal certainty and the presumption of legality attaching to European Union measures, whereby the applicants claimed, in essence, that the Commission had erred, in its decision, by partially nullifying the legal effects produced by the authorisation decisions.", "In examining those pleas, the General Court considered, inter alia, that the authorisation decisions precluded the Commission being able to attribute the exemptions at issue to the Member States themselves and, consequently, being able to classify them as State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC.", "Further, in Case T‑62/06 RENV, the General Court upheld the complaint of an infringement of the principle of sound administration.", "Forms of order sought by the parties", "17", "The Commission asks the Court to set aside the judgment under appeal, to refer the cases back to the General Court and to reserve the costs.", "18", "Ireland, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, Eurallumina and AAL contend that the appeal should be dismissed and that the Commission should be ordered to pay the costs.", "The appeal", "19", "The Commission advances five grounds in support of its appeal.", "The first two are procedural whereas the other three involve claims of substantive infringements of European Union law.", "20", "The first ground of appeal is based on the claim that the General Court lacked jurisdiction, that there were procedural irregularities and that there were infringements of the principle that the subject-matter of an action is defined by the parties, of Article 21 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and of Articles 44(1) and 48(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, and, in the alternative, that there was a failure to state reasons.", "Arguments of the parties", "21", "The Commission complains that the General Court erred in raising of its own motion a plea of infringement of Article 87(1) EC or in reclassifying the actual subject‑matter of the action.", "The Commission considers that the real reason which led to the annulment of the contested decision is that, according to the General Court, the exemptions at issue were not subject to the rules relating to the monitoring of State aid, because they were attributable not to the Member States concerned but to the European Union.", "Yet none of the applicants at first instance put forward that plea, which was brought into the debate by a question sent by the General Court to the parties on 20 July 2011, even though such a plea could not be raised by the court of its own motion.", "The General Court then attempted, in the judgment under appeal, to treat that plea as equivalent to those relied on by the parties, alleging an infringement of the principles of legal certainty and the presumption of legality attaching to European Union measures.", "22", "Ireland, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, Eurallumina and AAL contest that first ground of appeal.", "23", "First, the French Republic and the Italian Republic observe that the reasoning set out in the judgment under appeal is not solely based on the non-attributability of the exemptions at issue to the Member States, but rests on an examination both of the issue of distortion of competition and the issue of whether the aid could be attributed to the State, those being two essential prerequisites of a measure being classified as State aid.", "According to the Italian Republic, while the General Court is bound to give a ruling within the limits defined by the pleas in the action, it may however determine of its own motion whether one of the essential conditions for the existence of State aid is lacking, while remaining within the ambit of the provisions relied on in support of those pleas.", "24", "Ireland and the Italian Republic add that the General Court was entitled to raise of its own motion an infringement of essential procedural requirements.", "In this case, the Commission, by failing to set out in the contested decision the reasons why it considered that the exemptions at issue were attributable to the Member States, had failed to comply with its obligation to state reasons.", "25", "Secondly, the French Republic, Eurallumina and AAL consider, in essence, that the General Court amplified the pleas which they had put forward, as a result of the dialogue between the parties in the course of the procedure.", "The French Republic states that its first plea for annulment was based on an infringement of the concept of State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, while Eurallumina states that it had, without using the word ‘attributability’, raised the issue of whether the exemption affecting it could constitute aid granted by the Italian Republic.", "The Commission itself introduced the issue of the attributability of the exemptions at issue into the debate, in its defence to the plea alleging an infringement of the principle of legal certainty.", "According to Eurallumina, the General Court then examined that issue in order to reject the Commission’s arguments and to support its assessment of whether the effects of an authorisation granted by one European Union institution which leaves no discretion in respect of its implementation by the Member State can be called into question and nullified as they have been by another European Union institution.", "According to AAL, the General Court did no more than examine, and then reject, an argument of the Commission.", "26", "Thirdly, the French Republic, the Italian Republic and Eurallumina consider that, in any event, the issue of the attributability of the exemptions at issue is of relative importance in the grounds for the judgment under appeal which, if the first ground of appeal were upheld, would continue to be well founded on other grounds.", "Findings of the Court", "27", "It follows from the rules governing the procedure before the Courts of the European Union, in particular Article 21 of the Statute of the Court and Article 44(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, that the dispute is in principle determined and circumscribed by the parties and that the Courts of the European Union may not rule ultra petita.", "28", "While certain pleas may, and indeed must, be raised by the courts of their own motion, such as the question whether a statement of reasons for the decision at issue is lacking or is inadequate, which falls within the scope of essential procedural requirements, a plea going to the substantive legality of that decision, which falls within the scope of infringement of the Treaties or of any rule of law relating to their application, within the meaning of Article 263 TFEU, can, by contrast, be examined by the Courts of the European Union only if it is raised by the applicant (see, to that effect, Case C-367/95 P Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France [1998] ECR I-1719, paragraph 67; Case C-265/97 P VBA v Florimex and Others [2000] ECR I-2061, paragraph 114; and Commission v Ireland and Others, paragraph 40).", "29", "Consequently, a plea based on an infringement of Article 87(1) EC because of the non‑attributability of the measure in question to the State cannot be raised by a court of its own motion.", "30", "In this case, after stating in paragraphs 73 and 74 of the judgment under appeal that, before advantages can be classified as State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, they must, in particular, be attributable to the State, the General Court, in paragraphs 98 and 99 of the judgment under appeal, rejected the Commission’s arguments that the authorisation decisions could not, in any event, have the effect of relieving Ireland, the French Republic and the Italian Republic of their obligation to comply with State aid rules and procedures and that the Council was not entitled, in exercising its own powers in the area of fiscal harmonisation, to encroach on the Commission’s powers in the area of State aid.", "The General Court held that the advantages which the exemptions at issue might have conferred on their beneficiaries had been granted in accordance with the authorisation decisions, and consequently they were attributable not to the Member States but to the European Union and, accordingly, the Commission was not entitled, even in the exercise of its almost exclusive powers under Articles 87 EC and 88 EC, to classify those exemptions as State aid.", "31", "In paragraph 104 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court concluded that the authorisation decisions precluded the Commission being able to attribute the exemptions at issue to the Member States concerned and, therefore, being able to classify them as State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC and ordering their partial recovery to the extent that it regarded them as not compatible with the internal market, within the meaning of Article 87(3) EC.", "32", "Consequently, in paragraph 110 and in the operative part of the judgment under appeal, the General Court annulled the contested decision ‘in so far as it finds, or is based on the finding, that the exemptions [at issue] constituted State aid, within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC’ and in so far as it orders the recovery of those exemptions from their beneficiaries.", "33", "By holding that the exemptions at issue were attributable to the European Union, the General Court, rather than raising a plea based on an infringement of essential procedural requirements, as suggested by Ireland and the Italian Republic, instead raised a plea going to the substantive legality of the contested decision, which falls within the scope of an infringement of the EC Treaty.", "34", "Yet, as submitted by the Commission and as stated by the Advocate General in points 57 to 63 of his Opinion, none of the applicants before the General Court relied on such a plea.", "It is clear from the General Court’s file that the question of attributability of the exemptions at issue, merely alluded to by the Commission in its defence in Case T‑56/06, and by Eurallumina in its reply in Case T‑62/06, where however it stated that ‘[h]owever … it is not necessary to address this issue’, was introduced into the debate by the General Court by sending a written question to the parties, and, it may be added, it is also clear from paragraph 98 of the judgment under appeal.", "35", "Contrary to what is maintained by the French Republic, Eurallumina and AAL, it cannot be held that the General Court engaged in an amplification of the pleas raised by the parties.", "Although the General Court may have linked the question of the attributability of the exemptions at issue with the pleas relied on by the parties, alleging infringement of the principles of the presumption of legality attaching to European Union measures and legal certainty, it remains the case, first, that that question derives from a plea in law which is distinct and different in kind, its subject being not an infringement of general principles of European Union law but an infringement of the EC Treaty and, secondly, that the parties, as is clear from, in particular, the account of the parties’ pleas set out in paragraphs 53 to 56 of the judgment under appeal, did not plead those principles with a view to the court finding that the exemptions at issue did not constitute State aid.", "36", "It follows that, by raising of its own motion the plea that the exemptions at issue were attributable not to the Member States but to the European Union, and, for that reason, did not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, the General Court caused the judgment under appeal to be vitiated by an error in law.", "37", "However, the reasoning relating to the attributability of the exemptions at issue, dealt with only in paragraphs 73, 74, 98, 99 and 104 of the judgment under appeal, constitutes only one element of the grounds stated in that judgment.", "It is therefore necessary to examine whether that judgment remains well founded on the basis of the other grounds stated.", "38", "The General Court, in addition to the considerations relating to the non‑attributability of the exemptions at issue to the Member States, based the judgment under appeal on the following grounds.", "39", "In paragraphs 63 to 72 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held, first, that, in the light of the fact that the rules governing the harmonisation of national fiscal legislation and the rules on State aid have a shared objective, namely to promote the proper functioning of the internal market, by combating, inter alia, distortions of competition, the concept of distortion of competition had to be regarded as having the same scope and the same meaning in both those areas, in order to ensure the consistent implementation of those rules.", "The General Court stated, in that regard, that Article 8(4) and (5) of Directive 92/81 confers in particular on the Commission, which submits a proposal, and the Council, which enacts a measure, the responsibility for assessing whether there is any distortion of competition, in order to decide whether or not to authorise a Member State to apply or continue to apply an exemption from the harmonised excise duty and that, if the assessments differ, the Commission has the option of bringing an action for annulment of the Council’s decision.", "40", "The General Court then found, in paragraphs 76 to 97 of the judgment under appeal, that, in this case, it was not in dispute that Ireland, the French Republic and the Italian Republic had, in order to apply or continue to apply the exemptions at issue until 31 December 2003, relied on the authorisation decisions and that they had fully complied with those decisions which, in so far as restrictive conditions of a geographical and temporal nature were attached to them, were binding on those Member States.", "41", "In that context, in paragraphs 79 to 96 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court discounted the Commission’s arguments that the authorisation decisions, first, were a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of the Member States being able to grant the exemptions at issue and, second, did not alter the fact that, if those exemptions constituted State aid, within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, they had to be notified to the Commission and be authorised by it, in accordance with Article 88 EC, as stated in recital 5 in the preamble to Decision 2001/224.", "The General Court observed, in that regard, that the authorisation decisions prior to Decision 2001/224 contained no such qualification and held that recital 5 could not be construed as a manifestation of the Council’s intention to make the effects of its authorisation conditional on compliance with any subsequent procedures and decisions of the Commission in the area of State aid.", "42", "According to the General Court, the Commission’s interpretation of recital 5 in the preamble to Decision 2001/224 is rebutted by the Council’s reply to questions put by the General Court.", "Further, that interpretation could not, in any event, be accepted since it would result, in the circumstances of the case, in an inconsistent implementation of the rules governing the harmonisation of fiscal legislation and the rules on State aid, since, first, the authorisation decisions, adopted unanimously by the Council on a proposal from the Commission, were based on those two institutions’ shared assessment that the exemptions at issue did not give rise to a distortion of competition and did not impede the proper functioning of the internal market; secondly, the fact that those exemptions were regionally selective was a direct consequence of those decisions and, thirdly, those decisions authorised full exemptions from excise duties.", "43", "Last, after finding, in paragraphs 100 to 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had never used the powers available to it, under Article 8(5) of Directive 92/81 or Articles 230 EC and 241 EC, in order to secure the abolition or alteration of the authorisation decisions, an annulment of those decisions or a declaration that Directive 92/81 was invalid, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 104 and 105 of the judgment under appeal, that, when the contested decision was adopted, Decision 2001/224 remained valid and that that decision, the decisions which had preceded it and Directive 92/81 were entitled to the presumption of legality attaching to European Union measures and produced all their legal effects.", "The General Court held that, consequently, Ireland, the French Republic and the Italian Republic were entitled to rely on those decisions in order to continue to apply the exemptions at issue.", "The General Court concluded that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the contested decision directly called into question the validity of the exemptions at issue and also, indirectly, but necessarily, the validity of the authorisation decisions and the effects arising from those decisions, thereby infringing the principles of legal certainty and the presumption of legality attaching to European Union measures.", "44", "Further, in paragraphs 107 to 109 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court upheld the complaint alleging an infringement of the principle of sound administration, raised by Eurallumina in Case T‑62/06 RENV, holding that such an infringement resulted from the fact that the Commission had adopted the contested decision without taking account of the specific rights which the Italian Republic had conferred on that company in accordance with Decision 2001/224, the effects of which were legally protected by the principles of legal certainty and the presumption of legality attaching to European Union measures.", "45", "In so ruling, the General Court disregarded, however, the respective powers of the Council and the Commission in the area of the harmonisation of legislation relating to excise duties, on the one hand, and in the area of State aid, on the other.", "46", "It must be borne in mind that Directive 92/81 was adopted on the basis of Article 99 of the EEC Treaty (which became Article 99 of the EC Treaty, which itself became Article 93 EC) which conferred on the Council the power to adopt provisions for the harmonisation of legislation concerning turnover taxes, excise duties and other forms of indirect taxation to the extent that that harmonisation was necessary to ensure the establishment and functioning of the internal market.", "47", "The authorisation decisions were adopted pursuant to Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81, which granted to the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, the power to authorise any Member State to introduce exemptions or reductions other than those laid down by that directive ‘for specific policy considerations’.", "The purpose and the scope of the procedure laid down in that article differ from those of the rules established in Article 88 EC.", "48", "As the Court held in paragraphs 29 to 31 of Case C-110/02 Commission v Council [2004] ECR I-6333, the intention of the EC Treaty, in providing through Article 88 EC for aid to be kept under constant review and monitored by the Commission, is that the finding that aid may be incompatible with the common market is to be arrived at, subject to review by the General Court and the Court of Justice, by means of an appropriate procedure which it is the Commission’s responsibility to set in motion.", "Articles 87 EC and 88 EC thus reserve a central role for the Commission in determining whether aid is incompatible.", "The power conferred upon the Council in the area of State aid by the third subparagraph of Article 88(2) EC is exceptional in character, which means that it must necessarily be interpreted strictly (see also, to that effect, the judgment of 4 December 2013 in Case C‑111/10 Commission v Council [2013] ECR, paragraph 39).", "49", "Consequently, a Council decision authorising a Member State, in accordance with Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81, to introduce an exemption of excise duties could not have the effect of preventing the Commission from exercising the powers conferred on it by the Treaty and, consequently, setting in motion the procedure laid down in Article 88 EC in order to review whether that exemption constituted State aid and on the conclusion of that procedure, if appropriate, to adopt a decision such as the contested decision.", "50", "The fact that the authorisation decisions granted full exemptions from excise duties while setting detailed conditions of a geographical and temporal nature and that those conditions were strictly respected by the Member States had no effect on the division of powers between the Council and the Commission and therefore could not deprive the Commission of the right to exercise its powers.", "51", "It may be added that respect for that division of powers prompted recital 5 of Decision 2001/224, which was in force in the period for which the contested decision orders the recovery of aid, to state that Decision 2001/224 was to be without prejudice to the outcome of any procedures that might be undertaken under Articles 87 EC and 88 EC and that it did not override ‘the requirement for Member States to notify instances of potential State aid to the Commission …’.", "52", "Admittedly, the authorisation decisions were adopted on a proposal from the Commission and the latter never used the powers available to it, under Article 8(5) of Directive 92/81 or Articles 230 EC and 241 EC, in order to secure the abolition or alteration of the authorisation decisions, an annulment of those decisions or a declaration that Directive 92/81 was invalid.", "It is clear, in that regard, from the contested decision that the Commission had taken the view, at the time when the Council adopted the authorisation decisions, that those decisions did not give rise to a distortion of competition and did not impede the proper functioning of the internal market (Commission v Ireland and Others, paragraph 83).", "53", "However, as claimed by the Commission, the concept of State aid corresponds to an objective situation and cannot depend on the conduct or statements of the institutions (Commission v Ireland and Others, paragraph 72).", "Consequently, the fact that the authorisation decisions were adopted on a proposal from the Commission could not preclude those exemptions being classified as State aid, within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, if the conditions governing the existence of State aid were met.", "That fact however had to be taken into consideration in relation to the obligation to recover the incompatible aid, in the light of the principles of protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty, as was done by the Commission in the contested decision when it declined to order the recovery of aid granted before the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities of the decisions to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) EC.", "54", "It follows that the grounds of the judgment under appeal set out in paragraphs 39 to 44 of this judgment cannot provide a legal basis for the General Court’s conclusion that the contested decision calls into question the validity of the Council’s authorisation decisions and thereby is in breach of the principles of legal certainty and the presumption of legality attaching to European Union measures.", "The same is true of the conclusion, based on the same grounds, that, in Case T‑62/06 RENV, the Commission infringed the principle of sound administration.", "55", "In the light of the foregoing, the judgment under appeal must be set aside in its entirety, there being no need to examine the parties’ other arguments and pleas.", "Whether the cases should be referred back to the General Court", "56", "In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, the latter may, after quashing the decision of the General Court, itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits, or refer the case back to the General Court for judgment.", "57", "In the present case, since the General Court examined only some of a number of pleas in law put forward by the parties, the Court considers that the state of the proceedings does not permit it to give final judgment.", "Accordingly, the joined cases must be referred back to the General Court.", "Costs", "58", "Since the cases have been referred back to the

in paragraphs 1 to 13 of the judgments under appeal, may be summarised as follows.", "9", "As of 30 March 2009, Ireland introduced an excise duty, known as the air travel tax (‘ATT’), payable by every passenger embarking on an aircraft departing from an airport situated in Ireland, with a few exceptions that are irrelevant to the present proceedings, and collected directly from the airline operators.", "The airline operators were accountable for ATT and liable to pay it, although they were free to pass the tax on to passengers by including it in the ticket price.", "10", "At the time of its introduction, ATT was calculated on the basis of the distance between the departure and the arrival airports and imposed two separate rates on airline operators, namely EUR 2 per passenger in the case of a flight to an airport located no more than 300 km from Dublin airport (‘the lower rate of ATT’) and EUR 10 per passenger in all other cases (‘the higher rate of ATT’).", "11", "On 21 July 2009, Ryanair lodged two separate complaints with the Commission regarding ATT, one alleging a breach of the State aid rules and the other based on Article 56 TFEU and on Regulation No 1008/2008.", "In response to the second complaint, the Commission launched an investigation regarding possible infringement of the provisions on freedom to provide services and, on 18 March 2010, sent the Irish authorities a letter of formal notice.", "Ireland then amended, as of 1 March 2011, the rules on calculating ATT and introduced a single rate of EUR 3 per passenger, applicable to all flights regardless of the distance travelled.", "The Commission then concluded its investigation.", "12", "In response to Ryanair’s first complaint, on 13 July 2011 the Commission opened a formal investigation procedure, pursuant to Article 108(2) TFEU, in respect of the lower rate of ATT.", "The Commission adopted the decision at issue at the conclusion of that procedure.", "13", "Article 1 of that decision found that the State aid in the form of a lower air travel tax rate applicable to all flights operated by aircraft capable of carrying more than 20 passengers and not used for State or military purposes, departing from an airport handling more than 10000 passengers per year to a destination located no more than 300 km from Dublin airport between 30 March 2009 and 1 March 2011, unlawfully put into effect by Ireland in breach of Article 108(3) TFEU, was incompatible with the internal market.", "14", "Article 4(1) of the decision at issue required Ireland to recover the unlawful aid.", "Recital 70 of that decision stated that the amount of aid to be recovered was the difference between the lower rate of ATT and the higher rate, namely EUR 8 per passenger carried.", "That recital also identified Aer Lingus and Ryanair among the aid beneficiaries.", "The proceedings before the General Court and the judgments under appeal", "15", "By applications lodged with the Registry of the General Court on 1 November 2012 (Case T‑473/12) and 15 November 2012 (Case T‑500/12), respectively, both Aer Lingus and Ryanair brought actions for the annulment of the decision at issue.", "16", "In Case T‑473/12, Aer Lingus relied, in support of its action, on five pleas in law, alleging: (i) that the Commission erred in law in so far as, in the decision at issue, it classified the lower rate of ATT as ‘State aid’; (ii) breach of the principles of legal certainty, effectiveness and sound administration, due to the fact that the decision at issue ordered that the aid be recovered; (iii) an error of law and a manifest error of assessment on the part of the Commission, as it failed to take account of the fact that ATT was passed on to passengers in classifying the measure as aid and quantifying the advantage; (iv) breach of Article 14 of Regulation No 659/1999 and of the principles of proportionality and equal treatment, as a result of the order for recovery in the decision at issue; and (v) breach of the duty to state reasons.", "17", "In Case T‑500/12, Ryanair relied on five pleas in law in support of its action, alleging: (i) an error in law vitiating the Commission’s decision that the higher rate of ATT was the ‘normal’ or ‘legitimate standard’ rate; (ii) an error in law and manifest errors of assessment on the part of the Commission when evaluating the advantage granted by ATT; (iii) an error in law and manifest errors of assessment on the part of the Commission in relation to the recovery decision; (iv) failure to give notice of the Commission’s recovery decision; and (v) that the statement of reasons for the decision at issue was inadequate.", "18", "In the judgments under appeal, the General Court, first, examined and rejected the fifth pleas in both applications, alleging breach of the duty to state reasons.", "Neither the appeal nor the cross-appeal are concerned with those aspects of the judgments under appeal.", "19", "Second, with regard in particular to the action brought by Ryanair, the General Court examined and rejected, in paragraphs 42 to 56 of the Ryanair judgment, that company’s fourth plea in law.", "Neither the Commission’s appeal in Case C‑165/15 P nor Ryanair’s cross-appeal in that case is concerned with that aspect of that judgment.", "20", "Third, the General Court examined and rejected the first pleas in law in the actions brought by Aer Lingus and Ryanair.", "In essence, that court concluded that the Commission had not erred in law in classifying the higher rate of ATT as the ‘reference rate’ for the purpose of establishing whether there was a selective advantage and in concluding that the application of differentiated rates in the present cases constituted State aid benefiting the airlines whose flights were subject to the lower rate of ATT during the relevant period.", "21", "Fourth, the General Court examined in detail Aer Lingus’ third and fourth pleas and Ryanair’s second and third pleas and upheld them in part.", "22", "In carrying out that examination, the General Court concluded that the Commission had committed ‘an error of assessment and an error of law’ in so far as it set the amount of aid to be recovered from the beneficiaries, including Aer Lingus and Ryanair, at EUR 8 for each passenger having taken flights benefiting from the lower rate of ATT, namely the difference between that rate and the higher rate.", "According to the General Court, as it was possible for the economic advantage obtained from the application of the lower rate of ATT to be passed on, be it only in part, to passengers, the Commission was not justified in taking the view that the advantage enjoyed by the airlines concerned was automatically, in all cases, EUR 8 per passenger.", "23", "In paragraph 124 of the Aer Lingus judgment, the General Court therefore concluded that, ‘without it being necessary to rule on any infringement of the principles of proportionality and of equal treatment invoked’ by Aer Lingus, the third and fourth pleas in its application had to be upheld.", "24", "Similarly, in paragraph 150 of the Ryanair judgment, the General Court considered that it was necessary to uphold Ryanair’s second and third pleas in law ‘without it being necessary to examine the second part of the third plea in law and the additional arguments raised’ by Aer Lingus, intervener in that case in support of Ryanair.", "25", "Accordingly, in paragraph 1 of the operative part of the judgments under appeal, the General Court annulled Article 4 of the decision at issue ‘in so far as it orders the recovery of the aid from the beneficiaries for an amount which is set at EUR 8 per passenger in recital 70 of that decision’.", "In paragraph 2 of the operative part of those judgments, the General Court dismissed the actions as to the remainder.", "Forms of order sought by the parties before the Court of Justice", "26", "The Commission claims that the Court should:", "—", "set aside paragraph 1 of the operative part of the judgments under appeal;", "—", "dismiss the actions before the General Court in their entirety or, in the alternative, refer the cases back to the General Court;", "—", "dismiss the cross-appeals; and", "—", "order the applicants at first instance to pay the costs or, in the alternative, reserve the costs of the two sets of proceedings.", "27", "Aer Lingus and Ryanair contend that the Court should:", "—", "set aside paragraph 2 of the operative part of the judgments under appeal;", "—", "annul the contested decision;", "—", "dismiss the appeals; and", "—", "order the Commission to pay the costs.", "28", "Ireland claims that the Court should:", "—", "grant the Commission’s appeals and dismiss the actions before the General Court; and", "—", "dismiss the cross-appeals.", "The requests seeking the reopening of the oral part of the procedure", "29", "By letter lodged at the Court Registry on 19 July 2016, Aer Lingus requested the Court to order that the oral procedure be reopened, pursuant to Article 83 of the Court’s Rules of Procedure.", "In support of its request, Aer Lingus claims that it is necessary to define its position on the Advocate General’s Opinion, in particular the arguments set out and the case-law cited in points 79, 80, 83 and 88 to 89 of the Opinion.", "Aer Lingus is also of the view that it should be given the opportunity to submit its observations on the pleas and arguments that were not considered before the General Court, in the event that the Court of Justice should set aside the Aer Lingus judgment and consider that the state of the proceedings permits it to give final judgment.", "30", "By letter lodged at the Court Registry on 18 August 2016, Ryanair indicated that it supported Aer Lingus’ request that the oral procedure be reopened and also submitted a request that the oral procedure be reopened, essentially on the same grounds as those put forward by Aer Lingus.", "31", "It must be borne in mind that the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Rules of Procedure of the Court make no provision for parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General’s Opinion (judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk, C‑162/13, EU:C:2014:2146, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).", "32", "Under the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU, it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which, in accordance with the Statute of the Court of Justice, require the Advocate General’s involvement.", "The Court is not bound either by the conclusion reached by the Advocate General or by the reasoning which led to that conclusion.", "As a consequence, the fact that a party disagrees with the Advocate General’s Opinion, irrespective of the questions examined in the Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (judgment of 9 July 2015, InnoLux v Commission, C‑231/14 P, EU:C:2015:451, paragraphs 27 and 28 and the case-law cited).", "33", "However, the Court may, under Article 83 of its Rules of Procedure, at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order the opening or reopening of the oral part of the procedure, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where, after the close of that part of the procedure, a party has submitted a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for the decision of the Court.", "34", "That is not the position in the present cases.", "The Court, after hearing the Advocate General, considers that it has all the information necessary to give a ruling and that the case does not have to be examined in the light of a new fact which is of such a nature as to be a decisive factor for its decision or of an argument which has not been debated before it.", "35", "With regard, in particular, to the requests made by Aer Lingus and Ryanair to submit their observations on the pleas and arguments that were not examined by the General Court, in the event that this Court should set aside the judgments under appeal and consider that the state of the proceedings permits it to give final judgment, it follows from a reading of Article 168(1)(d), in conjunction with Article 173(1)(c) and Article 170(1) of the Court’s Rules of Procedure, that the parties to an appeal are invited, in their appeal and in their reply, to submit any relevant plea in law or argument, in particular in the event that the Court, pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, decides to dispose of the case where the appeal is upheld.", "Accordingly, the parties have been given the opportunity, during both the written and the oral procedure, to submit their observations on all aspects of the case which they consider relevant.", "Therefore, the claim made by Aer Lingus and Ryanair that it is necessary to submit observations on the pleas in law and arguments that were not examined by the General Court cannot justify the reopening of the oral procedure.", "36", "In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that there is no need to reopen the oral part of the procedure.", "The cross-appeals", "37", "In support of their respective cross-appeals, which must be examined first as they dispute the very existence of State aid in the present cases, Aer Lingus and Ryanair both put forward a single ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court erred in law in rejecting the first pleas in their respective actions for annulment, by which they disputed the classification of the lower rate of ATT as State aid.", "38", "Each of those grounds of appeal may be divided into four parts, by which Aer Lingus and Ryanair dispute the legality of the Commission’s decision, endorsed by the General Court, to take the higher rate of ATT, namely EUR 10 per passenger, as the ‘normal’ or reference rate in its assessment of the selective nature of the advantage deriving from the fact that certain flights were taxed at the lower rate of EUR 2 per passenger.", "Preliminary observations", "39", "It should be recalled that, according to Article 107(1) TFEU, save as otherwise provided in the Treaties, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods is, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, incompatible with the internal market.", "40", "According to settled case-law, the definition of ‘aid’ is more general than that of a ‘subsidy’, because it includes not only positive benefits, such as subsidies themselves, but also State measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which thus, without being subsidies in the strict sense of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect (judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 71 and the case-law cited).", "41", "Consequently, a measure whereby public authorities grant certain undertakings favourable tax treatment which, although not involving the transfer of State resources, places the recipients in a more favourable financial position than other taxpayers amounts to State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "On the other hand, advantages resulting from a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators, which is not therefore selective, do not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 TFEU (judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 72 and 73 and the case-law cited).", "42", "In the present cases, it is apparent from paragraphs 54 and 55 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraphs 79 and 80 of the Ryanair judgment that the Commission took the view, in the decision at issue, that in order to establish whether ATT was selective, it had to identify a ‘reference’ system and to determine whether that measure constituted a derogation from that system.", "Having established that the lower rate of ATT applied, essentially, only to domestic destinations and only to approximately 10% to 15% of all flights subject to ATT, the Commission concluded that the higher rate of ATT had to be considered the normal rate of the reference system, while the lower rate constituted an exception.", "43", "With regard to those considerations, before the General Court Aer Lingus and Ryanair merely criticised the use of the higher rate as the reference rate for the purpose of determining whether ATT was selective.", "44", "After examining and rejecting the arguments put forward in that regard by Aer Lingus and Ryanair, the General Court concluded, in paragraphs 76 and 90, respectively, of the Aer Lingus and Ryanair judgments, that the Commission did not err in law by characterising the higher rate of ATT as the ‘reference rate’ and, as a consequence, considering that the application of the different rates constituted State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, in favour of airlines whose flights were subject to the lower rate of ATT during the period covered by the decision at issue.", "45", "It is that finding by the General Court which, according to Aer Lingus and Ryanair, is vitiated by an error of law on the grounds put forward in the various parts of their respective single grounds of appeal.", "46", "That is the context in which the Court is required to analyse the various parts of the single grounds of appeal of Ryanair and Aer Lingus, which seek to show that the General Court’s reasoning is vitiated by an error of law, in that it endorsed the use of the higher rate of ATT as the reference rate and did not take into account the possibility that operators subject to the higher rate might be reimbursed in respect of part of that tax.", "The first part of Ryanair’s single ground of appeal will be examined first, followed by the fourth part of that ground and, lastly, together, all the parts of Aer Lingus’ single ground of appeal and the second and third parts of Ryanair’s single ground of appeal.", "The first part of Ryanair’s single ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "47", "Ryanair takes issue with the General Court’s rejection, in paragraphs 74 to 76 of the Ryanair judgment, of its argument that, for the purpose of determining whether ATT at the reduced rate constituted State aid, the appropriate reference rate was EUR 3, which was adopted by the Irish authorities in March 2011.", "According to Ryanair, the fact that the EUR 3 rate was not applied during the period covered by the decision at issue does not preclude its adoption as the reference rate.", "The EUR 10 rate never existed independently of the lower rate and the two rates were introduced and abolished at the same time.", "As a consequence, Ryanair submits that there was never a ‘normal’ or ‘reference’ rate in the present cases.", "48", "The Commission and the Irish Government maintain, as their principal argument, that the first part of the single ground of appeal under consideration is ineffective, as Ryanair simply takes issue with paragraph 74 of the Ryanair judgment and does not criticise the reasoning elaborated by the General Court in paragraphs 75 and 76 of that judgment, which are sufficient in themselves to justify the dismissal of Ryanair’s argument before the General Court.", "In the alternative, the Commission and the Irish Government contend that Ryanair’s arguments are unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "49", "Contrary to what the Commission and the Irish Government claim, the first part of Ryanair’s single ground of appeal is not ineffective.", "Ryanair stated, in its appeal, that that part concerns not only paragraph 74 but also paragraphs 75 and 76 of the Ryanair judgment.", "Moreover, those three paragraphs develop, essentially, one and the same line of reasoning, based on the fact that, during the period covered by the decision at issue, the EUR 3 rate did not apply and could not therefore be used as the reference rate.", "50", "However, as regards the substance, Ryanair’s arguments cannot succeed.", "51", "It is the Court’s established case-law that, when appraising the requirement of selectivity, Article 107(1) TFEU requires assessment of whether, under a particular legal regime, a national measure is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ in comparison with others which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation (judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 75 and the case-law cited).", "52", "As the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point 41 of his Opinion, that assessment cannot be carried out by comparing the amount which the airlines subject to the lower rate of ATT were required to pay with a hypothetical tax amount, calculated on the basis or a rate which, as Ryanair itself accepts, did not apply to any flight or any airline during the period covered by the decision at issue .", "Thus, the General Court was correct to state, in paragraph 75 of the Ryanair judgment, that fixing a reference rate other than that actually applied during the period in question would not allow all the effects of ATT to be fully apprehended.", "53", "It follows that paragraphs 74 to 76 of the Ryanair judgment are not vitiated by the error of law alleged by Ryanair and that the first part of its single ground of appeal must be rejected.", "The fourth part of Ryanair’s single ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "54", "By the fourth part of its single ground of appeal, Ryanair submits that, contrary to the view taken by the General Court in paragraph 89 of the Ryanair judgment, the fact that both rates of ATT were introduced at the same time was relevant for the purpose of determining whether the lower rate of ATT constituted ‘State aid’.", "The simultaneous introduction of the two rates is not a question of a ‘technique of intervention’, as suggested by the General Court.", "Indeed, Ireland could not have envisaged a single rate of EUR 10 per passenger and it is for that reason that it subsequently chose to replace the two rates of ATT by a single rate of EUR 3 per passenger.", "Ryanair adds that the fact that the lower rate of ATT was applied less frequently is not sufficient for it to be possible to rule out the use of that rate as the reference rate, the frequency of taxable events subject to a given rate of tax being but one factor among others to be taken into consideration.", "55", "The Commission maintains that the fourth part of the single ground of appeal is unfounded, while the Irish Government submits that it is inadmissible because it is not sufficiently developed and, in the alternative, that it is unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "56", "Contrary to what is submitted by the Irish Government, Ryanair has set out to the requisite legal standard the reasons why it considers that paragraph 89 of the Ryanair judgment is vitiated by an error of law.", "57", "The fact nonetheless remains that those reasons are not such as to call into question the grounds of the General Court’s rejection of Ryanair’s argument, so that this part of Ryanair’s single ground of appeal must also be discounted.", "58", "As the General Court observed, in essence, in paragraph 89 of the Ryanair judgment, if the Court were to find that the lower rate of ATT did not procure a selective advantage for the undertakings liable to pay that rate on the sole ground that that rate was introduced at the same time as the rate of EUR 10 per passenger, that would be tantamount to a finding that the decision whether a State intervention measure constituted State aid depended on the technique used.", "As is apparent from the Court’s established case-law, Article 107(1) TFEU does not draw a distinction between measures of State intervention on the basis of the techniques used by the national authorities (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 87 and the case-law cited).", "59", "Accordingly, the fourth part of Ryanair’s single ground of appeal must also be rejected.", "The single ground of appeal of Aer Lingus and the second and third parts of Ryanair’s single ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "60", "Aer Lingus’ single ground of appeal may be divided into four parts.", "In the first part, Aer Lingus submits that, if paragraph 43 of the Aer Lingus judgment is to be interpreted as meaning that the examination of whether a particular measure constitutes State aid should always disregard the fact that the measure may be at odds with the provisions of EU law other than Articles 107 and 108 TFEU, then it is vitiated by an error of law.", "According to Aer Lingus, the pertinence of that question was recognised by the Court in paragraphs 31 and 32 of its judgment of 27 March 1980, Denkavit italiana (61/79, EU:C:1980:100), and paragraphs 14 to 16 of its judgment of 10 July 1980, Ariete (811/79, EU:C:1980:195).", "Moreover, it is apparent from paragraphs 23 and 24 of the judgment of 27 September 1988, Asteris and Others (106/87 to 120/87, EU:C:1988:457), and paragraph 60 of the judgment of 1 July 2010, ThyssenKrupp Acciai Speciali Terni v Commission (T‑62/08, EU:T:2010:268) that a payment made by the State as compensation for damage caused by it does not constitute State aid.", "61", "In that context, Aer Lingus recalls that it argued before the General Court that the levying of ATT at the rate of EUR 10 per passenger was unlawful, as it was contrary to Article 56 TFEU and Regulation No 1008/2008, and that ATT collected at that rate was liable to be repaid to the companies concerned.", "The fact that ATT at that rate was unlawful means that the lower rate of ATT cannot be characterised as State aid.", "62", "By the second part of its single ground of appeal, Aer Lingus submits that the General Court erred in law by concluding, in paragraph 63 of the Aer Lingus judgment, that the Commission was entitled to classify the rate of EUR 10 per passenger as the ‘normal’ rate of taxation, even though it was unlawful.", "Paragraph 58 of that judgment, according to which Aer Lingus’ argument was based on an erroneous premiss, is contradictory and vitiated by an error, as the Commission simply found in the decision at issue that it was the existence of different rates of ATT which constituted a restriction on freedom to provide services, not the higher rate per se.", "63", "In the third part of its single plea in law, Aer Lingus takes issue with paragraph 60 of the Aer Lingus judgment, which asserts that, as it would be possible to remedy tax discrimination, such as that arising from the existence of two different rates of ATT, by raising the lower rate to the level of the higher rate or, conversely, by reducing the higher rate to the level of the lower rate, or by introducing a new single rate, it is incorrect to claim that the higher rate of ATT is unlawful.", "According to Aer Lingus, that paragraph confuses the question of the action that the Member State must take to bring the discrimination to an end in the future with the question of the action that the Member State must take to remedy the ‘historic’ unlawfulness of the discriminatory tax rates.", "64", "Lastly, in the fourth part of its single plea in law, Aer Lingus takes issue with paragraph 61 of the Aer Lingus judgment, which states that ‘a right to reimbursement [of ATT paid at the rate of EUR 10 per passenger], even if it were proved, would not be automatic and would depend on a number of factors such as the applicable limitation periods for bringing such an action in national law, and the observance of general principles such as the absence of unjust enrichment’.", "Aer Lingus claims that the inherent unlawfulness of the higher rate of ATT or the differentiated rates, and the fact that Ireland was in principle liable to repay to the companies that had paid ATT at the higher rate the difference between that rate and the lower rate meant that the higher rate could not be described as the ‘normal’ tax rate.", "65", "By the second part of its single ground of appeal, Ryanair argues that the ATT rate of EUR 10 per passenger cannot constitute the ‘reference’ rate for the purpose of determining whether the lower rate of ATT may be characterised as State aid because, by analogy with the Court’s finding in its judgment of 6 February 2003, Stylianakis (C‑92/01, EU:C:2003:72), the rate of EUR 10 per passenger was at odds with Article 56 TFEU and Regulation No 1008/2008.", "To take the higher rate as the reference rate would undermine the consistency of EU law.", "66", "In the third part of its single ground of appeal, Ryanair submits that the General Court was incorrect to refer, in paragraph 88 of the Ryanair judgment, to ‘hypothetical reimbursement claims’ of ATT paid at the higher rate.", "In its view, the imposition of ATT at that rate was contrary to EU law and the excess tax charged should be repaid to the undertakings concerned.", "67", "The Commission and the Irish Government contest the arguments put forward by Aer Lingus and Ryanair and contend that they should be rejected as unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "68", "As regards, first, the first part of Aer Lingus’ single ground of appeal, it should be noted that the only decisive factor for determining whether a tax measure is to be classified as State aid and, in particular, for ascertaining whether that measure gives rise to more favourable tax treatment for its beneficiaries by comparison with other taxpayers, is the effects produced by the measure (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 87 and the case-law cited).", "69", "Accordingly, the fact that a tax measure is contrary to provisions of EU law other than Articles 107 and 108 TFEU does not mean that the exemption from that measure enjoyed by certain taxpayers cannot be classified as State aid, as long as the measure in question produces effects vis-à-vis other taxpayers and has not been either repealed or declared unlawful and, therefore, inapplicable (see, to that effect, judgment of 30 March 2005, Heiser, C‑172/03, EU:C:2005:130, paragraph 38).", "70", "That is, in essence, what the General Court stated in paragraph 43 of the Aer Lingus judgment and in paragraph 65 of the Ryanair judgment.", "Accordingly, contrary to what is claimed by Aer Lingus in the first part of its single ground of appeal, paragraph 43 of the Aer Lingus judgment is not vitiated by any error of law.", "71", "That conclusion is not called into question by the case-law relied on by Aer Lingus and cited in paragraph 60 above.", "72", "The effect of that case-law is simply that the reimbursement to an undertaking of an amount of tax which it was required to pay in breach of EU law or the damages which national authorities are ordered to pay to undertakings to compensate for the damage they have caused them does not constitute State aid.", "73", "The State aid with which the decision at issue is concerned derives neither from the reimbursement of a tax contrary to the provisions of EU law other than Articles 107 and 108 TFEU that was paid by Aer Lingus and Ryanair, nor from the payment of compensation to those two undertakings.", "That case-law is therefore irrelevant for the purposes of the present cases.", "74", "It follows that the first part of the Aer Lingus’ single ground of appeal must be rejected.", "75", "Next, the second to fourth parts of Aer Lingus’ single ground of appeal and the second and third parts of Ryanair’s single ground of appeal are based on the premiss that the fact that ATT is totally or partially at odds with provisions of EU law other than Articles 107 and 108 TFEU is likely to have a bearing on whether the total or partial exemption from that tax enjoyed by certain operators may be described as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, in so far as, in particular, the unlawfulness of that measure could give rise, in proceedings before the national courts, to the repayment of all or part of the tax in question to other operators who were not entitled to the exemption in question.", "76", "It is common ground that, when the Commission carried out its assessment and adopted the decision at issue, the tax measure in question was producing its effects, in the sense that certain airlines were paying ATT at the reduced rate, whereas others — which, according to the Commission’s assessment that went unchallenged by Aer Lingus and Ryanair, were in a comparable legal and factual situation in the light of the objectives of the tax measure at issue — were paying the same tax at the higher rate.", "77", "It follows from the considerations set out in paragraphs 68 and 69 above that the Commission was obliged to take account of those effects and could not ignore them simply on the basis that the airlines subject to less favourable tax treatment might obtain reimbursement of the excess tax which they had paid by commencing proceedings before the national courts, where appropriate on the basis of provisions of EU law other than Articles 107 and 108 TFEU.", "78", "It should be noted that it is not for the Commission but for the national courts to give a definitive decision on any claim for reimbursement of a tax alleged to be unlawful in the light of the law of the Member State concerned or contrary to the provisions of EU law other than Articles 107 and 108 TFEU, if necessary after those court have obtained from the Court of Justice, by way of a reference for a preliminary ruling, such clarification as may be necessary on the scope and interpretation of EU law.", "The effectiveness of Article 107 TFEU would be substantially diminished if the Commission were required, before classifying a measure as State aid within the meaning of that provision, to wait for the decision of the courts with jurisdiction regarding any reimbursement of excess tax or tax paid by certain taxpayers.", "79", "In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the second, third and fourth parts of Aer Lingus’s single ground of appeal and the second and third parts of Ryanair’s single ground of appeal must be rejected and, accordingly, the cross-appeals dismissed in their entirety as unfounded.", "The main appeals", "80", "In support of each of its appeals, the Commission, on the basis of identical arguments, relies on a single ground of appeal, alleging breach of Article 108(3) TFEU and Article 14 of Regulation No 659/1999.", "The appeals are directed against paragraphs 88 to 127 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraphs 119 to 152 of the Ryanair judgment.", "Arguments of the parties", "81", "The Commission claims that the General Court erred in law and infringed Article 108(3) TFEU and Article 14 of Regulation No 659/1999 in so far as, by finding that the Commission should have taken account of the extent to which the beneficiary airlines had passed on to passengers the advantage gained from the application of ATT at the lower rate, it created a new economic test for determining the amounts of State aid to be recovered, such as the aid at issue in the present cases.", "82", "Aer Lingus disputes the Commission’s arguments, which, it claims, are based on a misreading of the Aer Lingus judgment.", "It observes that the General Court found that ATT is an excise duty, that is, in other words, an indirect tax levied on passengers, who are the beneficiaries of the lower rate of ATT.", "The tax measure at issue cannot, therefore, be compared with a State subsidy or a measure enabling undertakings to make cost savings.", "Aer Lingus adds that it was not allowed to charge passengers on flights subject to the lower rate an amount in excess of that rate and that, if it was required to repay the EUR 8 per ticket demanded by the Commission, it would not be able to recover that sum retroactively from passengers who purchased the relevant ticket at the reduced rate.", "83", "Ryanair submits that the Commission’s single ground of appeal is ineffective.", "It contends that the General Court justified the annulment of Article 4 of the decision at issue on the basis of three distinct grounds, in paragraphs 120 to 133, 134 to 144 and 145 to 149, respectively, of the Ryanair judgment.", "The Commission’s appeal addresses only the first of those grounds, concerning the extent to which ATT was passed on to passengers, whereas the other two grounds, relating, respectively, to (i) the particular situation and competitive constraints of the market in question and (ii) the lack of any justification for the alleged need to recover the difference between the higher and lower rates of ATT in order to re-establish the status quo ante, are not contested by the Commission.", "84", "In the alternative, Ryanair maintains that the Commission’s single ground of appeal is unfounded.", "In its view, the General Court simply applied the principle that it is necessary to determine the actual value of the advantage gained as a result of the aid.", "Moreover, the Commission exaggerated the difficulties entailed in establishing a precise amount for that purpose if the solution advocated by the General Court were to be followed.", "Lastly, Ryanair observes that it would be illogical not to take account of the effect on customers of the advantage obtained by the aid beneficiary, bearing in mind that Article 13 of Directive 2014/104 allows the party responsible for an infringement of the competition rules to avoid payment, in a claim for damages, of the overcharge resulting from the infringement if it was passed on to the claimant’s customers.", "Findings of the Court", "85", "As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, contrary to what is claimed by Ryanair, the Commission’s single ground of appeal is not ineffective.", "86", "According to the Court’s well-established case-law, in an appeal, complaints directed against a ground included in a judgment of the General Court purely for the sake of completeness must be immediately dismissed as ineffective, since they cannot lead to the judgment under appeal being set aside (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 75 and the case-law cited).", "87", "However, in the present cases, contrary to Ryanair’s assertions, paragraphs 120 to 149 of the Ryanair judgment do not put forward three distinct grounds, each of which would be sufficient in itself to justify the annulment of Article 4 of the decision at issue.", "Those paragraphs, in the same way as paragraphs 104 to 123 of the Aer Lingus judgment, which are worded in very similar terms, develop different aspects of the General Court’s single line of reasoning justifying its decision — given in paragraph 123 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraph 119 of the Ryanair judgment — that the Commission had committed ‘an error of assessment and an error of law’ by setting the amount of aid to be recovered from the airlines at EUR 8 per passenger.", "Those different aspects of the reasoning are interlinked and Ryanair’s separation of them into three allegedly separate grounds is artificial and fails to have regard to their internal cohesion.", "88", "Furthermore, the arguments relied on by the Commission call into question the General Court’s entire line of reasoning, not simply a part of that reasoning, as claimed by Ryanair.", "89", "That said, as regards the analysis of the substance of the Commission’s single ground of appeal, it should be noted, first, that the obligation on the Member State concerned to abolish, through recovery, aid considered by the Commission to be incompatible with the single market has as its purpose, according to the Court’s established case-law, to restore the situation as it was before the aid was granted (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 April 1995, Commission v Italy, C‑350/93, EU:C:1995:96, paragraph 21 and the case-law cited).", "90", "That objective is attained once the aid in question, together, where appropriate, with default interest, has been repaid by the recipient, or, in other words, by the undertakings which actually enjoyed the benefit of it.", "By repaying the aid, the recipient forfeits the advantage which it had enjoyed over its competitors on the market, and the situation prior to payment of the aid is restored (judgment of 29 April 2004, Germany v Commission, C‑277/00, EU:C:2004:238, paragraph 75 and the case-law cited).", "91", "Second, the recovery of unlawful aid with a view to re-establishing the status quo ante does not imply reconstructing past events differently on the basis of hypothetical elements such as the choices, often numerous, which could have been made by the operators concerned, since the choices actually made with the aid might prove to be irreversible (judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774, paragraph 118).", "92", "It follows, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point 62 of his Opinion, that recovery of such aid entails the restitution of the advantage procured by the aid for the recipient, not the restitution of any economic benefit the recipient may have enjoyed as a result of exploiting the advantage.", "That benefit may not be the same as the advantage constituting the aid and there may indeed be no such benefit, but that cannot justify any failure to recover that aid or the recovery of a different sum from that constituting the advantage procured by the unlawful aid in question.", "93", "With regard, in particular, to unlawful aid granted in the form of a tax advantage, it is also the Court’s settled case-law that recovery of aid means that the transactions actually carried out by the recipients of the aid in question must be subject to the tax treatment which the recipients would have received in the absence of the unlawful aid (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774, paragraph 119).", "94", "In the present cases, the tax advantage conferred by ATT consisted, according to the decision at issue, in the application during the period in question of different tax rates, which had the effect of conferring a benefit on airlines in Ireland that had to pay the EUR 2 tax rate by comparison with other airlines that had to pay EUR 10 per passenger during the same period.", "Aer Lingus and Ryanair have failed to demonstrate that, in so far as it establishes the existence of State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, that decision is vitiated by unlawfulness.", "95", "In those circumstances, in the light of the considerations set out in paragraphs 89 to 93 above, it must be concluded that restitution of the advantage procured by the aid measure, as identified by the decision at issue, required the Irish tax authorities to recover from the beneficiaries of the lower rate of ATT the difference between the amount of ATT which, in the absence of unlawful aid, should have been paid in respect of each of the flights in question, namely the amount of ATT at the higher rate, and the amount of ATT actually paid — in other words, the amount calculated on the basis of the lower rate of ATT.", "96", "Accordingly, it must be found that, in the present cases, repayment of the aid called for the recovery of a sum of EUR 8 per passenger for each of the flights concerned, as the Commission stated in Article 4 of the decision at issue.", "97", "The considerations set out in paragraphs 104 to 123 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraphs 120 to 149 of the Ryanair judgment cannot justify, contrary to the view reached by the General Court, any different conclusion.", "98", "In so far as, under the applicable Irish legislation, airlines were directly liable for ATT, it is of little consequence, in the circumstances of the present cases, that that tax was classified under Irish law as ‘excise duty’.", "For the same reason, the question whether, from a technical point of view, ATT is to be classified as a direct or indirect tax is irrelevant.", "99", "Equally irrelevant, as regards the question of the recovery of the aid, is the notion of ‘economic passing on’ referred to in paragraph 91 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraph 123 of the Ryanair judgment, respectively.", "The General Court stated in that connection, as regards flights subject to the lower rate of EUR 2 per passenger, that for the purpose of assessing the ‘economic passing on’, it was necessary to determine to what extent the airlines concerned actually retained the economic advantage arising from the application of the lower rate.", "100", "As is apparent from paragraphs 92 and 93 above, the recovery of aid entails the restitution of the advantage procured by the aid for the beneficiary, not the restitution of the economic benefit that may have been conferred by the aid as a result of the exploitation of the advantage.", "There is therefore no need to examine whether and to what extent those airlines actually utilised the economic advantage arising from the application of the lower rate.", "101", "The considerations of the General Court set out in paragraphs 92 to 105 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraphs 124 to 136 of the Ryanair judgment disclose the same confusion between the advantage obtained as a result of the effect of the lower rate of ATT and the benefit which the aid recipients derived or could have derived from that advantage.", "102", "Indeed, contrary to the view expressed by the General Court in paragraph 105 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraph 136 of the Ryanair judgment, the advantage, as identified by the Commission in the decision at issue, did not consist in the fact that the airlines subject to the lower rate were able to ‘offer more competitive prices’.", "It consisted, quite simply, in the fact that those companies had to pay a lower rate of ATT than they would have had to pay if their flights had been subject to the higher rate of ATT.", "The question whether that advantage enabled them to offer more competitive ticket prices, or whether they exploited that advantage differently, relates to the assessment of any benefit they were able to accrue from the exploitation of the advantage granted; that assessment is irrelevant to the recovery of the aid.", "103", "The General Court was also incorrect in stating, in paragraph 110 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraph 141 of the Ryanair judgment, respectively, that the circumstances of the cases before it were different from those of the case giving rise to the judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano (C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774) as the airlines benefiting from the lower rate of ATT ‘could not have opted for an operation other than that which was coupled with the aid’.", "104", "As the General Court acknowledged, in essence, in paragraph 111 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraph 142 of the Ryanair judgment, there was nothing to prevent those airlines from increasing by EUR 8 the ticket price, excluding tax, of flights subject to the lower rate of ATT.", "The fact that, pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No 1008/2008, they could add to the ticket price, excluding tax, only EUR 2, corresponding to ATT calculated at the reduced rate, does not lead to any different conclusion, as the amount corresponding to the difference between the two rates of ATT, namely EUR 8, could have been included previously in the price of the ticket, excluding tax.", "105", "The considerations set out above are not called into question by Ryanair’s argument based on Article 13 of Directive 2014/104.", "As is apparent from the Court’s case-law cited in paragraphs 89 and 90 above, the recovery of unlawful aid had a different purpose from that of Directive 2014/104.", "In particular, that directive, as is made clear in recitals 3 and 4 thereof, seeks to ensure that any person who considers that he has been adversely affected by an infringement of the competition rules laid down in Articles 101 and 102 TFEU may effectively exercise his right to claim compensation for the harm which he believes he has suffered.", "On the other hand, the purpose of aid recovery is not to seek compensation for individual harm of any kind, but to re-establish, on the market in question, the situation as it was before the aid was granted.", "106", "It is apparent from all the foregoing considerations that, by finding, in paragraph 123 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraph 119 of the Ryanair judgment, respectively, that the Commission had committed ‘an error of assessment and an error of law’, by setting the amount of aid to be recovered from the beneficiaries of the lower rate of ATT at EUR 8 per passenger in respect of the flights to which that rate applied, the General Court’s decision was vitiated by an error of law.", "107", "As a consequence, the Commission’s appeals must be upheld and paragraph 1 of the operative part of the Aer Lingus judgment and of the Ryanair judgment must be set aside.", "The action before the General Court", "108", "In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the Court quashes the decision of the General Court, it may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits.", "That is so in the present cases.", "109", "As the judgments under appeal are to be set aside only in so far as concerns paragraph 1 of their respective operative parts and not in so far as concerns paragraph 2 thereof, the Court is not setting aside the General Court’s rejection of Aer Lingus’ first and fifth pleas in law or the first, fourth and fifth pleas in law put forward by Ryanair.", "Accordingly, it is necessary to examine only the second to fourth pleas in law relied on by Aer Lingus in its action before the General Court and the second and third pleas relied on by Ryanair.", "The third and fourth pleas in law relied on by Aer Lingus in its action before the General Court and the first part of the third plea in law relied on by Ryanair before that court", "110", "Aer Lingus and Ryanair maintain, in essence, that the Commission committed an error in law and an error of assessment by setting the amount of aid to be recovered at EUR 8 per passenger in respect of each flight subject to the lower rate of ATT.", "111", "Those arguments must be rejected for the reasons set out in paragraphs 85 to 106 above.", "112", "Aer Lingus and Ryanair also contend that, as the airlines no longer have the option of recovering the EUR 8 they have to repay from each of the passengers on flights subject to the lower rate of ATT, the obligation to pay that sum, imposed by Article 4 of the decision at issue, is equivalent to the imposition of an additional tax or a penalty, in breach of the principles of proportionality and equal treatment, and fails to have due regard for the Court’s case-law that repayment of aid cannot be regarded as a penalty.", "113", "Those arguments must also be rejected.", "114", "As the Advocate General observed in point 83 of his Opinion, the recovery of an amount equal to the difference between the tax that would have been payable in the absence of an unlawful aid measure and the lesser amount paid pursuant to that measure does not constitute a new tax imposed retroactively (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 June 1993, Commission v Greece, C‑183/91, EU:C:1999:233, paragraph 17).", "What is at issue is the recovery of the part of the original tax which was not paid due to the availability of an unlawful exemption.", "The recovery of such an amount does not constitute a penalty (judgment of 17 June 1999, Belgium v Commission, C‑75/97, EU:C:1999:311, paragraph 65).", "115", "Similarly, with regard to the argument that the airlines affected by the recovery requirement are not in a position to recover from their own customers the additional tax which they are required repay, it is sufficient to point out that, as the unlawful aid identified by the Commission in the decision at issue consisted in the application of the lower rate of ATT, that is, a partial exemption from a tax borne not by the customers of those airlines but by those airlines themselves, the recovery of that aid necessarily entails the repayment of the difference between the two rates applicable.", "As is apparent from paragraphs 99 and 100 above, that is also the case even where the recipients of the aid have derived no benefit from the advantage in question, either because they have passed that advantage on to their customers, or for some other reason.", "116", "Lastly, the imposition of the obligation to recover that aid infringes neither the principle of proportionality nor the principle of equal treatment.", "First, it is the Court’s settled case-law that abolishing unlawful aid by means of recovery is the logical consequence of a finding that it is unlawful.", "Accordingly, the recovery of such aid, for the purpose of restoring the previously existing situation, cannot in principle be regarded as disproportionate to the objectives of the provisions of the FEU Treaty relating to State aid (judgments of 11 March 2010, CELF and Ministre de la Culture et de la Communication, C‑1/09, EU:C:2010:136, paragraph 54, and of 28 July 2011, Diputación Foral de Vizcaya and Others v Commission, C‑471/09 P to C‑473/09 P, not published, EU:C:2011:521, paragraph 100).", "117", "On the other hand, the aid recipients, which are required to repay the aid, are obviously not in the same situation as airlines which did not receive the aid and are not affected by the recovery, so that there can be no question of different treatment of similar situations, in breach of the principle of equal treatment.", "118", "It follows from the foregoing considerations that the third and fourth pleas in law relied on by Aer Lingus and the first part of the third plea in law relied on by Ryanair before the General Court must be rejected.", "The second plea relied on by Aer Lingus and the second part of the third plea relied on by Ryanair before the General Court", "119", "Aer Lingus and Ryanair submit that the airlines subject to the higher rate of ATT are entitled to reimbursement of the excess tax paid, both on the ground that the introduction of two different rates constitutes a breach of freedom to provide services enshrined in Article 56 TFEU and on the basis of the case-law deriving from the judgment of 7 September 2006, Laboratoires Boiron (C‑526/04, EU:C:2006:528).", "As a consequence, the recovery, from the recipients that enjoyed the benefit of the lower rate of ATT, of the difference between that rate and the higher rate would amount to a breach of Article 14(1) of Regulation No 659/1999 and of the principles of legal certainty, effectiveness and sound administration.", "Moreover, such recovery would give rise to serious distortion of competition.", "As a result of such recovery, it is the airlines on which the recovery measure was imposed that would be placed in a disadvantageous position, as they would then have to pay a total sum of EUR 10 per passenger, whereas the other airlines, which were reimbursed EUR 8 out of the EUR 10 per passenger originally paid, would have to pay tax at the rate of only EUR 2 per passenger.", "120", "It should be noted in that regard that the nature of the measure concerned by the decision at issue is in no way analogous to that which was the subject of the judgment of 7 September 2006, Laboratoires Boiron (C‑526/04, EU:C:2006:528).", "121", "ATT was a tax of general application and, in the decision at issue, the Commission reached the conclusion that the lower rate of ATT was equivalent to a partial exemption which, in itself, constituted an aid measure.", "In those circumstances, those liable to pay the tax in question cannot claim that the exemption enjoyed by other businesses constitutes State aid in order to avoid payment of that tax or to obtain reimbursement (judgment of 7 September 2006, Laboratoires Boiron, C‑526/04, EU:C:2006:528, paragraphs 30 and 32 and the case-law cited).", "122", "That said, it should be observed that, as is apparent from paragraphs 78 and 79 above, in circumstances such as those of the present cases, the Commission cannot refrain from finding that a case involves State aid on the sole ground that it is possible that the national courts with jurisdiction may order the airlines which did not have the benefit of the lower rate of ATT to repay the excess ATT.", "As it was under a duty to establish the existence of State aid, the Commission was also under a duty to order the recovery of that aid.", "123", "In those circumstances, it is for the Member State concerned, in this case Ireland, to ensure, by all appropriate means and in accordance with both domestic and EU legislation, that any national measures which have the effect of reimbursing certain undertakings in respect of a tax does not give rise to new aid incompatible with the FEU Treaty, to the benefit of the undertakings receiving such reimbursement.", "124", "It is clear from the foregoing considerations that the second plea relied on by Aer Lingus and the second part of the third plea relied on by Ryanair before the General Court must be rejected.", "Ryanair’s second plea in law", "125", "In its second plea before the General Court, Ryanair argued that the Commission should have taken account of the proportionate impact of ATT on the various competing undertakings when assessing the advantage conferred by ATT, as, first, a much higher percentage of the flights of certain airlines, in particular Aer Arann, benefited from the reduced rate of ATT and, second, the impact of ATT, calculated at the higher rate, was considerably less on business class and long-haul flights, offered mainly by Aer Lingus.", "126", "Aer Lingus, in its capacity as intervener in Case T‑500/12, does not support Ryanair’s claims in so far as concerns Ryanair’s second plea in law and considers that the relative extent of the advantage conferred on the various recipients may be relevant for the purpose of determining the amount of aid to be recovered.", "However, as the only purpose of intervention is to support, in whole or in part, the claims of one of the parties, Aer Lingus’ argument on this point is inadmissible.", "127", "Ryanair’s argument cannot succeed.", "The fact that certain beneficiaries of an aid measure might derive from the advantage which the aid represents a proportionately greater benefit than that enjoyed by the other beneficiaries of the same measure does not preclude the Commission from either classifying the measure in question as State aid incompatible with the single market or ordering the recovery of the advantage derived from the use of the aid.", "128", "It follows that Ryanair’s second plea in law before the General Court is unfounded and must be rejected.", "129", "Accordingly, first, as Aer Lingus’ first and fifth pleas before the General Court and the first, fourth and fifth pleas relied on by Ryanair before that court were rejected by the General Court, and the pleas raised by Aer Lingus and Ryanair, in their respective cross-appeals, challenging the grounds of the judgments under appeal supporting the dismissal of their applications have not been successful, paragraph 2 of the operative part of the judgments under appeal is now final and, second, as it is apparent from all the foregoing considerations that the other pleas put forward by Aer Lingus and Ryanair before the General Court seeking the annulment of the decision at issue must also be rejected, their respective actions for annulment must be dismissed in their entirety.", "Costs", "130", "Under Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs.", "131", "Under Article 138(1) of those rules, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "132", "As Aer Lingus and Ryanair have been unsuccessful both in their cross-appeals and in their actions before the General Court and the Commission has applied for costs, they must be ordered to bear their own costs and to pay the costs incurred by the Commission both before the General Court and before the Court of Justice.", "133", "In accordance with Article 140(1) of the Court’s Rules of Procedure, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article

insolvency of Heitkamp BauHolding GmbH (‘HBH’) seeks, primarily, annulment of the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 4 February 2016, Heitkamp BauHolding v Commission (T‑287/11, ‘the judgment under appeal’, EU:T:2016:60), in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court rejected as unfounded HBH’s action for the annulment of Commission Decision 2011/527/EU of 26 January 2011 on State aid C 7/10 (ex CP 250/09 and NN 5/10) implemented by Germany — Scheme for the carry-forward of tax losses in the case of restructuring of companies in difficulty (Sanierungsklausel) (OJ 2011 L 235, p. 26, ‘the contested decision’), and the annulment of that decision.", "2", "By its cross-appeal, the European Commission asks the Court to set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as, by that judgment, the General Court dismissed the plea of inadmissibility which it had raised against that action and, consequently, to dismiss the action at first instance as inadmissible.", "Background to the dispute and the contested decision", "3", "The facts giving rise to the dispute and the contested decision, as set out in paragraphs 1 to 35 of the judgment under appeal, may be summarised as follows.", "German law", "4", "In Germany, pursuant to Paragraph 10d(2) of the Einkommensteuergesetz (Law on income tax, ‘the EStG’), losses made in the course of a tax year may be carried forward to later tax years, with the result that the losses in question may be subtracted from the taxable income of the following years (‘the loss carry-forward rule’).", "Pursuant to Paragraph 8(1) of the Körperschaftsteuergesetz (Law on corporation tax; ‘the KStG’), the loss carry-forward rule applies to undertakings subject to corporation tax.", "5", "The possibility of carrying losses forward led to the acquisition, for the sole purpose of tax savings, of undertakings which had ceased trading, but whose losses could still be carried forward.", "In order to prevent such transactions, considered to be unlawful, the German legislature, in 1997, inserted Paragraph 8(4) into the KStG, which restricts the possibility of carrying forward losses to those companies legally and economically identical to those which incurred the losses.", "6", "Paragraph 8(4) of the KStG was repealed with effect from 1 January 2008 by the Unternehmensteuerreformgesetz (Business Taxation Reform Act).", "That law inserted a new Paragraph 8c(1) into the KStG (‘the rule governing the forfeiture of losses’) which limits or excludes the possibility of carrying forward losses where 25% or more of the shares in a company are acquired (‘the prejudicial acquisition of a shareholding’).", "Under that provision, if, within a period of five years, 25% to 50% of the subscribed share capital, membership rights, ownership rights or voting rights is transferred, unused losses are forfeited on a pro rata basis.", "Moreover, unused losses are forfeited if more than 50% of the share capital, membership rights, ownership rights or voting rights is transferred to an acquirer.", "7", "No exception to the rule governing the forfeiture of losses was envisaged.", "The tax authorities were entitled, however, in the event of a prejudicial acquisition of a shareholding whose purpose was to reorganise an undertaking in difficulty, to grant tax relief based on considerations of equity, pursuant to a decree of the Bundesministerium der Finanzen (Federal Ministry of Finance, Germany) of 27 March 2003.", "8", "In June 2009, the Bürgerentlastungsgesetz Krankenversicherung (Law on Citizens’ Relief — Health Insurance Fund), inserted subparagraph 1a into Paragraph 8c of the KStG (‘the restructuring clause’ or ‘the measure at issue’).", "Pursuant to that new provision, an entity may carry losses forward, even in the event of a prejudicial acquisition of a shareholding within the meaning of Paragraph 8c(1) of the KStG, provided that: (i) the acquisition serves the purpose of restructuring the corporate entity, (ii) the company is, or is likely to be, insolvent or over-indebted at the time of the acquisition, (iii) the company’s fundamental business structures are preserved, which essentially entails the safeguarding of jobs, a significant injection of business assets, or write-off of debts which are still recoverable, (iv) the company does not change its sector of activity during the five years following the acquisition, and (v) the company had not ceased operation at the time of the acquisition.", "9", "The disputed measure came into force on 10 July 2009 and was applicable retroactively from 1 January 2008, the date of entry into force of the rule governing the forfeiture of losses.", "The contested decision", "10", "In Article 1 of the contested decision, the Commission found that ‘the State aid granted unlawfully on the basis of Paragraph 8c(1a) of the [KStG], unlawfully put into effect by [the Federal Republic of Germany] …, is incompatible with the internal market’.", "11", "For the purposes of the classification of the restructuring clause as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, the Commission found, inter alia, that that clause created an exception to the rule established by Paragraph 8c(1) of the KStG, which provided for the forfeiture of losses not used by companies whose ownership had changed, and that that clause was therefore liable to confer a selective advantage on companies that met the requirements for benefiting therefrom, which was not justified by the nature or general scheme of the tax system, since the purpose of the measure at issue was to tackle problems due to the economic and financial crisis, an objective which was extrinsic to that system.", "In Articles 2 and 3 of that decision, the Commission nevertheless found that some individual aid granted under that scheme was, subject to compliance with certain conditions, compatible with the internal market.", "12", "In Article 4 of the contested decision, the Commission ordered the Federal Republic of Germany to recover from the beneficiaries the incompatible aid granted under the scheme referred to in Article 1 of that decision.", "Pursuant to Article 6 of the latter, that Member State was required, in particular, to provide the Commission with a list of those beneficiaries.", "Background to the dispute", "13", "HBH is a company which has been at risk of insolvency since 2008.", "On 20 February 2009, its parent company acquired the shares therein in order to merge with it for the purposes of its restructuring.", "On the date of the transaction, HBH met the conditions for application of the restructuring clause.", "That is clear from the binding information of 11 November 2009 issued by the Finanzamt Herne (Herne tax office, Germany) (‘the binding information’).", "Furthermore, on 29 April 2010, HBH received from the Herne tax office a notice of advance payment relating to corporation tax for the 2009 tax year, which took account of the losses carried forward pursuant to the restructuring clause.", "14", "By letter of 24 February 2010, the Commission informed the Federal Republic of Germany of its decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure provided for under Article 108(2) TFEU in respect of the measure at issue.", "By letter of 30 April 2010, the Federal Ministry of Finance ordered the German tax authorities to stop applying that measure.", "15", "On 27 December 2010, the notice of advance payment of 29 April 2010 was replaced by a new notice of advance payment relating to corporation tax for the 2009 tax year which did not take account of the restructuring clause.", "In January 2011, HBH inter alia received notices of advance payment relating to corporation tax on the subsequent tax years and which also disregarded the restructuring clause.", "On 1 April 2011, it received a notice of advance payment relating to corporation tax for the 2009 tax year.", "Since Paragraph 8c(1a) of the KStG was not applicable, it was not able to carry forward the losses existing on 31 December 2008.", "16", "On 19 April 2011, the Herne tax office annulled the binding information.", "17", "On 22 July 2011, the Federal Republic of Germany sent the Commission the list of undertakings which had benefited from the measure at issue.", "It also sent the Commission a list of companies for which binding information concerning the application of the restructuring clause had been annulled, which included HBH.", "The procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal", "18", "By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 6 June 2011, HBH brought an action for annulment of the contested decision.", "19", "By a separate document lodged at the Court Registry on 16 September 2011, the Commission raised an objection of inadmissibility under Article 114 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court of 2 May 1991 .", "20", "On 29 August 2011, the Federal Republic of Germany applied for leave to intervene in support of the form of order sought by HBH.", "That application was granted by order of the President of the Second Chamber of the General Court of 5 October 2011.", "21", "Consideration of the objection of inadmissibility was reserved for the final judgment, in accordance with Article 114(4) of those Rules of Procedure, by order of the Court of 21 May 2014.", "22", "In support of its action, HBH relied on two pleas in law: first, that the measure at issue was not prima facie selective and, second, that it was justified by the nature or general scheme of the system.", "23", "By the judgment under appeal, the General Court, on the one hand, dismissed the objection of inadmissibility; it held that HBH was directly and individually concerned by the contested decision on the ground, in essence, that it had, before the adoption of the decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure, an acquired right to a tax saving, certified by the German tax authorities, and had, in addition, an interest in bringing proceedings .", "The General Court further dismissed the action of HBH as unfounded.", "Forms of order sought and procedure before the Court of Justice", "24", "By its appeal, HBH claims that the Court should:", "–", "set aside points 2 and 3 of the operative part of the judgment under appeal, and the contested decision;", "–", "in the alternative, annul points 2 and 3 of the operative part of the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the General Court;", "–", "order the Commission to pay the costs.", "25", "The Commission claims that the Court should dismiss the appeal and order HBH to pay the costs.", "26", "By its cross-appeal, the Commission claims that the Court should:", "–", "set aside point 1 of the operative part of the judgment under appeal;", "–", "dismiss the action brought at first instance as inadmissible;", "–", "dismiss the appeal;", "–", "set aside point 3 of the operative part of the judgment under appeal ordering the Commission to pay a third of its costs; and", "–", "order HBH to pay the costs of the proceedings before the Court of Justice and before the General Court.", "27", "HBH contends that the cross-appeal should be dismissed and that the Commission should be ordered to pay the costs.", "28", "At the hearing, the Federal Republic of Germany presented oral observations, from which it is apparent that it supports HBH’s heads of claim seeking dismissal of the cross-appeal, annulment of the judgment under appeal in so far as it dismissed the action at first instance as unfounded, and annulment of the contested decision.", "The cross-appeal", "29", "Since the cross-appeal relates to the admissibility of the action at first instance, a question which must be resolved before turning to the merits raised by the main appeal, it is appropriate to examine it first.", "Arguments of the parties", "30", "The Commission submits that, in paragraphs 50 to 79 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court erred in law in its interpretation of the concept of individual concern within the meaning of Article 263, fourth paragraph, TFEU.", "31", "First, referring to the judgments of 19 October 2000, Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission, C‑15/98 and C‑105/99, EU:C:2000:570), and of 9 June 2011, Comitato Venezia vuole vivere and Others v Commission (C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P, EU:C:2011:368), the Commission submits that the relevant criterion for establishing whether an applicant is individually concerned by a Commission decision declaring an aid scheme incompatible with the internal market lies in whether the applicant is an actual or potential recipient of aid granted under the scheme.", "Only actual recipients are individually concerned by such a decision.", "32", "In paragraphs 62, 70 and 74 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court based its decision not on that case-law, but on judgments which are not relevant to the present case.", "None of the circumstances which led to the conclusion, in the cases which gave rise to the judgments of 17 January 1985, Piraiki-Patraiki and Others v Commission (11/82, EU:C:1985:18); of 22 June 2006, Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission (C‑182/03 and C‑217/03, EU:C:2006:416); of 17 September 2009, Commission v Koninklijke FrieslandCampina (C‑519/07 P, EU:C:2009:556); of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonpunt and Others v Commission (C‑132/12 P, EU:C:2014:100); and of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonlinie and Others v Commission (C‑133/12 P, EU:C:2014:105), on which the General Court relies in those paragraphs, that the applicants were individually concerned, are material in the present case.", "33", "Thus, contrary to what the General Court stated at paragraphs 63 and 74 of the judgment under appeal, the assessment of the admissibility of the action at first instance does not depend on the ‘factual and legal situation’ of HBH or the existence of an ‘acquired right’, but exclusively on whether HBH did indeed receive aid under the aid scheme in question.", "Paragraphs 75 and 76 of the judgment under appeal are also allegedly flawed in that, by the judgment of 9 June 2011, Comitato Venezia vuole vivere and Others v Commission (C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P, EU:C:2011:368), on which the General Court relied in paragraph 76 of that judgment, it can only be inferred that it is irrelevant, for the purposes of assessing individual concern, that the Commission’s decision is accompanied by a recovery order of aid actually granted.", "34", "Secondly, the Commission notes that the determining factor used by the General Court, in its analysis of the ‘factual and legal situation’ of HBH, in order to establish that it is individually concerned by the contested decision, is the existence of an ‘acquired right’ referred to at paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal.", "If that ‘acquired right’ were to be understood as an acquired right within the meaning of EU law, then the General Court erred in law.", "Such a right can be afforded only pursuant to the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations and, according to the case-law of the Court, the benefit of that protection is excluded in principle as regards aid granted in breach of the obligation of notification laid down in Article 108(3) TFEU.", "35", "Thirdly, on the basis of that observation, the Commission submits that, in the event that, by ‘acquired right’, the Court was concerned with a right acquired under national law, it also erred in law, since the benefit derived from a right acquired under national law is, in the circumstances of the present case, also contrary to the case-law excluding, in the case of aid granted in breach of Article 108(3) TFEU, the benefit derived from such a right", "36", "Point 1 of the operative part of the judgment under appeal should therefore be set aside and, since HBH is not an actual beneficiary of the aid scheme in question, the application at first instance should be dismissed as inadmissible.", "37", "HBH and the Federal Republic of Germany submit that the cross-appeal is unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "38", "Under the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, any natural or legal person may, under the conditions laid down in the first and second paragraphs of that article, institute proceedings against an act addressed to that person or which is of direct and individual concern to them, and against a regulatory act which is of direct concern to them and does not entail implementing measures.", "39", "In the present case, first, it is common ground that, as the General Court observed in paragraph 57 of the judgment under appeal, the contested decision is addressed solely to the Federal Republic of Germany.", "Moreover, as is apparent from paragraphs 58 to 79 of that judgment, whereas HBH was directly and individually concerned by that decision, and thus by virtue of the second situation referred to in that provision, the General Court held that HBH had locus standi.", "40", "By the first part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission submits, in essence, that, in paragraphs 62, 63, 70 and 74 to 77 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court erred in law in assessing the condition of admissibility of HBH’s action in the light of the latter’s factual and legal situation, whereas the only relevant criterion was whether it was an actual or potential recipient of the aid scheme in question.", "41", "According to the settled case-law of the Court, persons other than those to whom a decision is addressed may claim to be individually concerned only if the decision affects them by reason of certain attributes peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons and if, by virtue of those factors, it distinguishes them individually in the same way as the person addressed (judgments of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission, 25/62, EU:C:1963:17, p. 107, and of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonpunt and Others v Commission, C‑132/12 P, EU:C:2014:100, paragraph 57).", "42", "The possibility of determining more or less precisely the number, or even the identity, of the persons to whom a measure applies by no means implies that it must be regarded as being of individual concern to them as long as that measure is applied by virtue of an objective legal or factual situation defined by it (judgments of 16 March 1978, Unicme and Others v Council, 123/77, EU:C:1978:73, paragraph 16, and of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraph 47 and the case-law cited).", "43", "Thus, the Court stated that an undertaking cannot, as a general rule, contest a decision of the Commission which prohibits a sectoral aid scheme if it is concerned by that decision solely by virtue of belonging to the sector in question and being a potential beneficiary of the scheme.", "Such a decision is, vis-à-vis such an undertaking, a measure of general application covering situations which are determined objectively and entails legal effects for a class of persons envisaged in a general and abstract manner (see judgments of 19 October 2000, Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission, C‑15/98 and C‑105/99, EU:C:2000:570, paragraph 33 and the case-law cited, and of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraph 49).", "44", "In contrast, where the decision affects a group of persons who were identified or identifiable when that measure was adopted by reason of criteria specific to the members of the group, those persons might be individually concerned by that measure inasmuch as they form part of a limited class of traders (judgments of 13 March 2008, Commission v Infront WM, C‑125/06 P, EU:C:2008:159, paragraph 71 and the case-law cited, and of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonpunt and Others v Commission, C‑132/12 P, EU:C:2014:100, paragraph 59).", "45", "Thus, the actual recipients of individual aid granted under an aid scheme of which the Commission has ordered the recovery are, accordingly, individually concerned within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 October 2000, Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission, C‑15/98 and C‑105/99, EU:C:2000:570, paragraphs 34 and 35; see, also, judgment of 9 June 2011, Comitato Venezia vuole vivere and Others v Commission, C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P, EU:C:2011:368, paragraph 53).", "46", "Admittedly, as argued by the Commission, it follows from that case-law that the Court, on the one hand, acknowledges that the actual recipients of individual aid granted under an aid scheme incompatible with the internal market are individually concerned by a Commission decision declaring that scheme incompatible with the internal market and ordering its recovery, and, on the other hand, precludes an applicant from being regarded as individually concerned merely because it is a potential beneficiary of the scheme.", "However, it cannot be inferred, as the Commission claims, that, where a Commission decision declaring an aid scheme incompatible with the internal market is at issue, the only relevant criterion for the purpose of determining whether an applicant is individually concerned, within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, by such a decision, is whether the applicant is an actual or potential recipient of aid granted under the scheme.", "47", "As also noted, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 57, 59, 67 and 68 of his Opinion, the case-law cited in paragraphs 43 and 45 of the present judgment, in the specific context of State aid, is merely a specific expression of the relevant legal test for assessing individual concern, within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, stemming from the judgment of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission (25/62, EU:C:1963:17).", "According to that judgment, an applicant is individually concerned by a decision addressed to another person where that decision affects them by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them, or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons (see also, in the field of State aid, judgments of 19 October 2000, Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission, C‑15/98 and C‑105/99, EU:C:2000:570, paragraph 32, and of 9 June 2011, Comitato Venezia vuole vivere and Others v Commission, C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P, EU:C:2011:368, paragraph 52, and, in other fields, judgments of 17 January 1985, Piraiki-Patraiki and Others v Commission, 11/82, EU:C:1985:18, paragraphs 11, 19 and 31, and of 13 March 2018, European Union Copper Task Force v Commission, C‑384/16 P, EU:C:2018:176, paragraph 93).", "48", "Consequently, the fact that an applicant may fall within or outside the category of actual or potential recipients of individual aid granted under an aid scheme declared incompatible with the internal market by a Commission decision is not decisive as regards determining whether the applicant is individually concerned by that decision, where it is in any event established that the applicant is otherwise affected by it by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to it or a factual situation which differentiates it from all other persons.", "49", "It follows from the foregoing that it is without erring in law that, after setting out, in paragraphs 60 to 62 of the judgment under appeal, the case-law set out in paragraphs 41 to 44 of the present judgment, the General Court, in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, committed ‘to determine whether, given its legal and factual situation, [HBH] must be regarded as being individually concerned by the contested decision’.", "50", "It also follows that it is without erring in law that, in paragraphs 62, 70 and 74 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court, in support of its analysis, relied on the judgments referred to in paragraph 32 of the present judgment, since they all consist in applying the criterion of individual concern laid down in the judgment of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission (25/62, EU:C:1963:17), in circumstances where, as in the present case, the specific expression of that case-law, taking the form of a distinction between the actual and potential recipients of individual aid granted under an aid scheme declared incompatible with the internal market, did not appear relevant.", "51", "Likewise, nor did the General Court err in law, in paragraphs 75 and 76 of the judgment under appeal, in rejecting the Commission’s argument that only an advantage effectively granted through State resources could establish that HBH was individually concerned on the basis of the judgment of 9 June 2011, Comitato Venezia vuole vivere and Others v Commission (C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P, EU:C:2011:368).", "As has already been stated in paragraph 47 of present judgment, in order to establish that an applicant is individually concerned, within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, by a Commission decision declaring an aid scheme incompatible with the internal market, the relevant criterion is whether the applicant is affected by that decision by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to it or a factual situation which differentiates it from all other persons , which the General Court also correctly recalled in paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal.", "52", "Consequently, since the first part of the single ground of appeal of the cross-appeal is unfounded, it must be rejected.", "53", "As regards the second and third parts of that single ground of appeal, it should be recalled that, in them, the Commission alleges that the General Court, in paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal, erred in law in holding that HBH was individually concerned on the ground that that company had had an ‘acquired right’ to receive aid under the measure at issue.", "54", "In that respect, it should be noted that, in paragraph 74 of that judgment, the General Court stated in particular that ‘in the present case, … it was found that, because of the particularities of the German tax legislation, [HBH] had an acquired right to a tax saving, certified by the German tax authorities …, that circumstance setting it apart from other operators which are concerned only as potential beneficiaries of the measure at issue’, referring in that respect to paragraph 68 of the judgment.", "55", "In paragraph 68 of that judgment, the General Court found that the circumstances which it had identified in paragraphs 66 and 67 of that judgment as characterising HBH’s legal and factual situation within the meaning of the judgment of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission (25/62, EU:C:1963:17), had been certified by the German tax authorities, in particular by means of binding information.", "Those circumstances consisted, on the one hand, in the fact that, prior to the initiation of the formal investigation procedure by the Commission, HBH had a right, under German legislation, to carry its losses forward where the conditions stipulated by the restructuring clause were satisfied and, on the other, in the fact that, during 2009, HBH made taxable profits from which it claims to have deducted the losses carried forward under the restructuring clause.", "56", "It concluded, in paragraph 69 of the judgment under appeal, that, ‘pursuant to the German legislation, it was certain that, at the close of the 2009 tax year, [HBH] would have made a tax saving, which it was, moreover, able to quantify precisely’, since ‘the German authorities had no discretion with regard to the application of the measure at issue, the realisation of that tax saving was only a matter of time, under the detailed rules for the implementation of the tax system’.", "In point 69, it stated that, consequently, HBH ‘had an acquired right, certified by the German authorities before the adoption of the opening decision and, subsequently, of the contested decision, to the application of that tax saving, which, had it not been for those decisions, would have crystallised as a result of the issue of a tax assessment authorising the loss carry-forward and the consequent posting thereof to the applicant’s balance sheet’ and that it ‘was, therefore, easily identifiable by the German tax authorities and the Commission’.", "57", "It concluded, in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal, that HBH ‘may not be regarded solely as an undertaking concerned by the contested decision because it belongs to the sector in question and because of its status as a potential beneficiary, but must rather be seen as being part of a closed category of traders, who were identified or at least readily identifiable at the time of the adoption of the contested decision, within the meaning of the judgment [of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission (25/62, EU:C:1963:17)]’.", "58", "It is thus apparent from a reading of the relevant passages of the judgment under appeal that the use by the General Court, in paragraph 74 of that judgment, of the words ‘acquired right’ was intended only to refer briefly to HBH’s specific factual and legal situation, making it possible to regard it as being individually concerned by the contested decision within the meaning of the judgment of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission (25/62, EU:C:1963:17).", "59", "Since the second and third parts of the single ground of appeal are thus based on a misreading of the judgment under appeal, they must be rejected as unfounded, and, accordingly, the cross-appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.", "The main appeal", "60", "In support of its appeal, HBH relies on two grounds, the first alleging infringement of the obligation to state reasons to which the General Court is subject, and the second alleging infringement of Article 107 TFEU.", "The second ground of appeal must be examined first of all.", "Arguments of the parties", "61", "By its second ground of appeal, HBH submits, first, that the General Court infringed Article 107 TFEU in that, in confirming the Commission’s position that the rule governing the forfeiture of losses constitutes the relevant reference framework in the present case, it established that reference framework incorrectly.", "In paragraphs 103 and 106 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court, first of all, correctly identified the general tax scheme, namely the loss carry-forward rule.", "However, it is the rule governing the forfeiture of losses provided for in Paragraph 8c(1) of the KStG and, therefore, the exception to the general scheme, that it accepted as constituting the applicable common or normal tax regime for the purposes of assessing the condition relating to selectivity.", "It incorrectly failed to take account of the loss carry-forward rule.", "By classifying an exception to the general tax system as a ‘reference framework’, the General Court erred in law or, at the very least, distorted the evidence submitted to it or national law.", "62", "Establishing the common or normal tax regime by combining the basic rule and the exception also constitutes an error of law, especially since the rules which the General Court is alleged to have combined in paragraph 104 of the judgment under appeal do not fall on the same legal footing, the loss carry-forward rule constituting an expression of the constitutional principle of taxation according to ability to pay.", "63", "Furthermore, it is clear from paragraphs 104 and 107 of the judgment under appeal that the General Court, in its identification of the reference framework, also conflated the first and second stages of the examination of the condition relating to selectivity and thus incorrectly applied the case-law.", "64", "Secondly, the General Court infringed Article 107 TFEU in its review of the a priori selective nature of the measure at issue.", "On the one hand, it erred in law in holding that the legal and factual situation of the undertakings requiring restructuring and that of the healthy companies were comparable.", "In particular, the objective, pursued by all provisions relating to taxation, of generating tax revenue does not suffice to give rise to the comparability of the situations of the operators concerned.", "65", "On the other hand, the restructuring clause is a general measure.", "Paragraph 141 of the judgment under appeal conflicts with the case-law according to which the only relevant factor for the purposes of assessing the general nature of a measure is whether it applies irrespective of the nature or scope of the business of the undertaking or if its application requires the undertaking to change its activity.", "66", "Thirdly, the General Court is alleged to have infringed Article 107 TFEU in rejecting the justification for the restructuring clause.", "In paragraphs 158 to 160 and 164 to 166 of the judgment under appeal, it incorrectly held that the purpose of that clause is to promote the restructuring of undertakings in difficulty and concluded that that objective was extrinsic to the tax system.", "In paragraphs 166 to 170 of that judgment, it also rejected the justification based on the principle of taxation according to ability to pay.", "67", "HBH also submits that the second ground of appeal is admissible, since it raises only questions of law.", "In particular, it does not relate to the assessment of facts, but to the application of erroneous criteria in order to determine the reference framework and the legal characterisation of the facts by the General Court, which is subject to review by the Court in the context of an appeal.", "68", "The Commission contends, primarily, that the second ground of appeal is inadmissible.", "The first and third parts thereof relate to the determination of national law, and thus also matters of fact.", "In any event, in so far as, by the first part of that ground of appeal, HBH criticises the General Court for having determined the reference framework by taking account of a regulation applicable only to a specific group of companies, it is based on a misreading of paragraphs 103 to 109 of the judgment under appeal.", "It follows that the General Court merely identified the law applicable to all undertakings, insofar as economic identity and continuity are the decisive factor in respect of the carry-forward of losses, and they are issues of fact.", "69", "Consequently, the second part of the second ground of appeal is also inadmissible.", "On the one hand, the issue of the comparability of the situation of economic operators and that of identifying the relevant objective in that regard are questions of fact.", "On the other, the General Court erred in law in declaring admissible the argument which was submitted to it by HBH concerning the classification of the contested measure as a general measure, since it could not be regarded as an expansion of the first part of the first plea raised before it.", "70", "In the alternative, the second ground of appeal is unfounded.", "First of all, the argument put forward by HBH regarding the definition of the reference framework is not supported either by German law or by the documents submitted to the Court.", "In addition, the German legislature itself established the rule governing the forfeiture of losses as being the new basic rule.", "The General Court did not therefore err in stating that, further to the introduction of Paragraph 8c(1) of the KStG, the abolition of the loss carry-forward rule in the event of a prejudicial acquisition of a shareholding is the new rule of principle of German tax law.", "71", "Secondly, HBH’s argument relating to the alleged lack of comparability of the situation of the relevant traders stems from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.", "On the one hand, from the point of view of the change in economic identity, there is no difference between companies requiring restructuring and those which require no such restructuring.", "72", "On the other hand, the restructuring clause is not a general measure, but a selective measure.", "In that regard, the judgment of 7 November 2014, Autogrill España v Commission (T‑219/10, EU:T:2014:939), does not effectively support the position of HBH.", "73", "Thirdly, the General Court correctly established, in its unappealable assessment of the facts, that the purpose of the restructuring clause is to help struggling businesses.", "In any event, the argument that the purpose of that clause is to prevent excessive taxation is ineffective, since the General Court, at paragraphs 167 to 173 of the judgment under appeal, found that there was no justification even if that objective is retained.", "Furthermore, the General Court also correctly rejected the arguments based on German constitutional law and fictitious profits.", "74", "The Federal Republic of Germany submits that the General Court, like the Commission, erred in law when determining the reference framework.", "Referring to the judgments of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom (C‑106/09 P et C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732), and of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free and Others, (C‑20/15 P et C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981), that Member State notes that, in order to classify a measure as ‘selective’, the Commission must first identify the normal tax regime applicable in the Member State concerned and then demonstrate that the measure under examination differentiates between undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, find themselves in a comparable factual and legal situation.", "For those purposes, an approach based solely on the regulatory technique cannot be accepted.", "75", "In the present case, however, the Commission’s approach was based solely on the regulatory technique; the General Court, in failing to call it into question even though it is contrary to the case-law of the Court, erred in law.", "Thus, in the judgment under appeal, the General Court correctly recorded the content and scope of the relevant tax provisions, but gave them an incorrect legal characterisation.", "Findings of the Court", "76", "By the first part of its second ground of appeal, HBH, supported by the Federal Republic of Germany, submits, in essence, that the General Court, in paragraphs 103 to 107 of the judgment under appeal, incorrectly determined the reference framework within which the selectivity of the measure at issue was to be examined.", "77", "Since the Commission objected to the admissibility of that first limb, on the ground that it concerned questions of fact, it should be noted that, admittedly, the assessment of facts and evidence does not constitute, save where the clear sense of the facts and evidence has been distorted, a question of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice in the context of an appeal.", "However, where the General Court has determined or assessed the facts, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction under Article 256 TFEU to review their legal characterisation and the legal conclusions which were drawn therefrom (judgments of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 78 and the case-law cited, and of 20 December 2017, Comunidad Autónoma del País Vasco and Others v Commission, C‑66/16 P to C‑69/16 P, EU:C:2017:999, paragraph 97).", "78", "Thus, with respect to the assessment, in the context of an appeal, of the General Court’s findings on national law, which, in the field of State aid, constitute findings of fact, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction only to determine whether that law was distorted (see, to that effect, judgments of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 79 and the case-law cited, and of 20 December 2017, Comunidad Autónoma del País Vasco and Others v Commission, C‑66/16 P to C‑69/16 P, EU:C:2017:999, paragraph 98).", "By contrast, since the assessment, in the context of an appeal, of the legal classification which has been given to that national law by the General Court in the light of a provision of EU law constitutes a question of law, it falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice (see, to that effect, judgments of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 83, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraphs 61 to 63).", "79", "In the present case, it must be stated that, by that first part, HBH is not disputing the content or the scope of national law as found by the General Court, but rather the classification as a ‘reference framework’ which, like the Commission in the contested decision, the General Court gave to the rule governing the forfeiture of losses.", "80", "However, the concept of ‘reference framework’ refers to the first step of the assessment of the condition relating to the selectivity of the advantage, which, according to the case-law of the Court, is a constituent factor in the concept of ‘State aid’ within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU (judgments of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 74 and the case-law cited, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 54).", "81", "Since the purpose of HBH’s line of argument is to call into question the legal characterisation of the facts by the General Court, the first part of the second ground of appeal is admissible.", "82", "On the merits, it should be recalled that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, classification of a national measure as ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, requires all the following conditions to be fulfilled.", "First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources.", "Second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States.", "Third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient.", "Fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (judgments of 10 June 2010, Fallimento Traghetti del Mediterraneo, C‑140/09, EU:C:2010:335, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 53 and the case-law cited).", "83", "So far as concerns the condition relating to the selectivity of the advantage, it is clear from settled case-law that, in order to assess that condition, it is necessary to determine whether, under a particular legal regime, the national measure in question is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over others which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation and which are accordingly subject to different treatment that can, in essence, be classified as discriminatory (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 54 and the case-law cited).", "84", "Further, where the measure at issue is conceived as an aid scheme and not as individual aid, it is for the Commission to establish that that measure, although it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or certain business sectors (judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 55 and the case-law cited).", "85", "As regards, in particular, national measures that confer a tax advantage, it must be recalled that a measure of that nature which, although not involving the transfer of State resources, places the recipients in a more favourable position than other taxpayers is capable of procuring a selective advantage for the recipients and, consequently, constitutes State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU .", "On the other hand, a tax advantage resulting from a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators does not constitute aid within the meaning of that provision (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 72 and 73 and the case-law cited; see, also, judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 56).", "86", "In that context, in order to classify a national tax measure as ‘selective’, the Commission must begin by identifying the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, and thereafter demonstrate that the tax measure at issue is a derogation from that ordinary system, in so far as it differentiates between operators who, in the light of the objective pursued by that ordinary tax system, are in a comparable factual and legal situation (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 57 and the case-law cited).", "87", "The concept of ‘State aid’ does not, however, cover measures that differentiate between undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by the legal regime concerned, are in a comparable factual and legal situation, and are, therefore, a priori selective, where the Member State concerned, thirdly, is able to demonstrate that that differentiation is justified since it flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which the measures form part (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 September 2006, Portugal v Commission, C‑88/03, EU:C:2006:511, paragraph 52; see also judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 58 and the case-law cited).", "88", "The examination of the selectivity condition therefore implies, in principle, the determination, first, of the reference framework within which the measure concerned falls, that determination being of greater importance in the case of tax measures, since the very existence of an advantage may be established only when compared with ‘normal’ taxation (see, to that effect, judgments of 6 September 2006, Portugal v Commission, C‑88/03, EU:C:2006:511, paragraph 56, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraph 55).", "89", "Thus, the determination of the set of undertakings which are in a comparable factual and legal situation depends on the prior definition of the legal regime in the light of whose objective it is necessary, where applicable, to examine whether the factual and legal situation of the undertakings favoured by the measure in question is comparable with that of those which are not (judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraph 60).", "90", "However, the classification of a tax system as ‘selective’ is not conditional upon that system being designed in such a way that undertakings which might enjoy a selective advantage are, in general, subject to the same tax burden as other undertakings but benefit from derogating provisions, so that the selective advantage may be identified as being the difference between the normal tax burden and that borne by those former undertakings (judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 91).", "91", "Such an interpretation of the selectivity criterion would require that in order for a tax system to be classifiable as ‘selective’ it must be designed in accordance with a certain regulatory technique; the consequence of this would be that national tax rules fall from the outset outside the scope of control of State aid on account of the sole fact that they were adopted under a different regulatory technique although, by adjusting and combining various tax rules, they produce the same effects in law and/or in fact.", "It therefore conflicts with settled case-law that Article 107(1) TFEU does not distinguish between measures of State intervention by reference to their causes or their aims but defines them in relation to their effects, and thus independently of the techniques used (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 87, 92 and 93 and the case-law cited).", "92", "If, on the basis of that case-law, the use of a regulatory technique cannot enable national tax rules to escape from the outset the scrutiny concerning State aid provided for under the FEU Treaty, resorting to the regulatory technique used is not sufficient to define the relevant reference framework for the purposes of assessing the condition relating to selectivity, except in order to ensure that the form of State intervention prevails decisively over its effects.", "Consequently, as also noted, in essence, by the Advocate General in point 108 of his Opinion, the regulatory technique used cannot be decisive for the purposes of determining the reference framework.", "93", "However, it also follows from that case-law that while, for the purposes of establishing the selectivity of a tax measure, the regulatory technique used is not decisive, with the result that it is not always necessary for it to derogate from a common tax system, the fact that it is a derogation as a result of the use of that regulatory technique is relevant for those purposes where it follows that two categories of operators are distinguished and a priori treated differently, namely those covered by the derogation and those which are covered by the ordinary taxation regime, even though those two categories are in a comparable situation with regard to the objective pursued by that system (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 77).", "94", "Further, it must be recalled that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for the application of a measure may benefit from the measure does not, in itself, make it selective (judgments of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 42, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 59).", "95", "It is in the light of those considerations that the Court must examine whether, as maintained by HBH and the Federal Republic of Germany, the General Court disregarded, in the present case, Article 107(1) TFEU, as interpreted by the Court of Justice, in holding that the Commission had not erred in holding that the relevant reference framework for assessing the selectivity of the measure at issue was constituted by the rule governing the forfeiture of losses.", "96", "In that regard, it should be noted that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that ‘in the contested decision, the Commission established … the rule governing the forfeiture of losses as being the general rule in respect of which it was appropriate to examine whether there was a distinction between the undertakings that were in a comparable factual and legal situation, while [HBH] refers to the more general rule of loss carry-forward, which applies to all taxation’.", "97", "It also pointed out, in paragraph 104 of that judgment, that ‘it is open to all undertakings to make use of the loss carry-forward rule in the context of the levying of corporation tax’ and that ‘the rule governing the forfeiture of losses restricts the use of that option in the event of the acquisition of a shareholding equal to or greater than 25% of the share capital and withdraws it in the event of the acquisition of more than 50% of the share capital’, stating that ‘the latter rule therefore applies systematically to all cases of a change of ownership of 25% or more of a company’s share capital, without drawing any distinction on the basis of the nature or characteristics of the undertakings concerned’.", "98", "In paragraph 105 of that judgment, the General Court additionally stated ‘furthermore, the restructuring clause is worded in the form of an exception to the rule governing the forfeiture of losses and applies only to those well-defined situations which are subject to that rule’.", "99", "In paragraph 106 of that judgment, it concluded that ‘it is clear that the rule governing the forfeiture of losses, like the loss carry-forward rule, is part of the legislative framework in the context of which the measure at issue arises’, that ‘in other words, the general loss carry-forward rule, as limited by the rule governing the forfeiture of losses, constitutes the relevant legal framework in the present case, and [that] it is precisely within that framework that it is appropriate to check whether the measure at issue differentiates between operators in a comparable factual and legal situation’.", "100", "In paragraph 107 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held that ‘the Commission did not err when, while noting the existence of a more general rule, namely the loss carry-forward rule, it determined that the legislative framework of reference established in order to assess the selectivity of the measure at issue was constituted by the rule governing the forfeiture of losses’.", "101", "As submitted by HBH and the Federal Republic of Germany, that reasoning led the General Court to classify incorrectly the rule governing the forfeiture of losses as the reference framework within the meaning of the case-law on Article 107(1) TFEU, while excluding from that reference framework the general rule of loss carry-forward.", "102", "It is apparent from that reasoning that, although the General Court found that there was a general tax rule applicable to all undertakings subject to corporation tax, namely the loss carry-forward rule, it held, however, that the Commission did not err in taking the view that the relevant reference framework for the purposes of examining the selective nature of the measure at issue was constituted only by the rule governing the forfeiture of losses, despite the fact that it was not disputed that that rule was itself an exception to the loss carry-forward rule and even though an overall examination of the content of those provisions should have made it possible to find that the restructuring clause’s effect was to define a situation falling under the general loss carry-forward rule.", "103", "As also noted, in essence, by the Advocate General in point 109 of his Opinion, it follows from the case-law of the Court, recalled in paragraphs 90 to 93 of the present judgment, that the selectivity of a tax measure cannot be precisely assessed on the basis of a reference framework consisting of some provisions that have been artificially taken from a broader legislative framework.", "Therefore, by thus excluding from the relevant reference framework in the present case the general rule of loss carry-forward, manifestly the General Court defined it too narrowly.", "104", "To the extent that, in reaching that conclusion, the Court relied on the fact that the measure at issue was worded in the form of an exception to the rule governing the forfeiture of losses, it should be recalled that, as has already been pointed out in paragraph 92 of the present judgment, the regulatory technique used cannot be decisive for the purposes of the determination of the reference framework.", "105", "In addition, any argument in support of the judgment under appeal cannot, in this case, be based on the judgment of 18 July 2013, P (C‑6/12, EU:C:2013:525), since, in that judgment, the Court did not rule on what should constitute the reference framework in the case before it.", "106", "It follows from all of the foregoing that the first part of HBH’s second ground of appeal is well founded, without it being necessary to examine the second part of the argument put forward to support it.", "It should also be noted that it is on the basis of its flawed legal assessment — that the Commission did not err in holding that the relevant reference framework in the present case for the purposes of assessing the selectivity of the measure at issue was made up only of the rule governing the forfeiture of losses — that the General Court analysed the submissions made to it by HBH, seeking to show, on the one hand, the lack of a priori selectivity of the measure at issue and, on the other hand, the justification of the measure by the nature and overall structure of the tax system.", "107", "As is apparent from the case-law referred to in paragraphs 83 and 86 to 89 of the present judgment, an error in the determination of the reference framework against which the selectivity of the measure should be assessed necessarily vitiates the whole of the analysis of the condition relating to selectivity.", "In those circumstances, the Court must uphold the appeal and set aside points 2 and 3 of the operative part of the judgment under appeal, without it being necessary to examine the second and third parts of the second ground of appeal, or the first ground of appeal.", "The action before the General Court", "108", "In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, if the Court quashes the decision of the General Court, it may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits.", "109", "That is the case here.", "In those circumstances, it is sufficient to note that it is apparent from the grounds set out in paragraphs 82 to 107 of the present judgment that the first limb of the first plea of HBH’s action before the General Court, in so far as it seeks to establish that the Commission erred in its determination of the relevant reference framework for the purposes of assessing the selectivity of the measure at issue, in that it defined it as being made up only of the rule governing the forfeiture of losses, is well founded.", "The selective nature of the measure at issue having thus been assessed by the Commission against a reference framework which was incorrectly determined, it is necessary to annul the contested decision.", "Costs", "110", "Under Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded or where the appeal is well founded

184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "112", "Since the Commission has been unsuccessful in the main appeal and in the cross-appeal, the contested decision having been annulled and HBH having applied for the Commission to be ordered to pay the costs, the Commission must be ordered to pay, in

at issue.", "Legal context", "3", "Article 1(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [108 TFEU] (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1) defines ‘aid scheme’ as ‘any act on the basis of which, without further implementing measures being required, individual aid awards may be made to undertakings defined within the act in a general and abstract manner and any act on the basis of which aid which is not linked to a specific project may be awarded to one or several undertakings for an indefinite period of time and/or for an indefinite amount’.", "4", "Article 14(1) of that regulation states:", "‘Where negative decisions are taken in cases of unlawful aid, the Commission shall decide that the Member State concerned shall take all necessary measures to recover the aid from the beneficiary (hereinafter referred to as a “recovery decision”).", "The Commission shall not require recovery of the aid if this would be contrary to a general principle of Community law.’", "Background to the disputes", "5", "For the purposes of the present proceedings, the background to the disputes, as set out in paragraphs 1 to 20 of the judgments of the General Court of 15 September 2016, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori v Commission (T‑220/13, not published, EU:T:2016:484), and of 15 September 2016, Ferracci v Commission (T‑219/13, EU:T:2016:485), (together ‘the judgments under appeal’) may be summarised as follows.", "6", "Mr Ferracci is the owner of a tourist bed and breakfast establishment consisting of two bedrooms.", "Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori is a private educational establishment.", "In 2006 and 2007 they brought complaints to the Commission, claiming that, first, the amendment to the scope of the national scheme of the Imposta comunale sugli immobili (municipal tax on real property, ‘ICI’) by the Italian Republic and, second, Article 149(4) of the Testo unico delle imposte sui redditi (single text of taxes on income, ‘the TUIR’) constituted State aid that was not compatible with the internal market.", "7", "The amendment to the scope of ICI aimed essentially to establish that the exemption from that tax enjoyed from 1992 by non-commercial entities carrying on, on their real property, exclusively social assistance, welfare, health care, educational, accommodation, cultural, recreational, sports and religious activities should be understood as also applicable to those activities ‘even if they were of a commercial nature’.", "Article 149(4) of the TUIR essentially exempted ecclesiastical bodies recognised as legal persons governed by civil law and amateur sports clubs from the application of the criteria laid down in that provision for all other entities for the purpose of determining the loss of the status of non-commercial entity.", "8", "On 12 October 2010 the Commission decided to open the formal investigation procedure under Article 108(2) TFEU concerning the exemption from ICI and Article 149(4) of the TUIR.", "9", "On 15 February 2012 the Italian authorities informed the Commission that they intended to adopt new rules on the municipal tax on real property and announced that the exemption from ICI would be replaced as from 1 January 2012 by the exemption under the new rules on the Imposta municipale unica (single municipal tax, ‘IMU’).", "Those rules were adopted on 19 November 2012.", "10", "On 19 December 2012 the Commission adopted the decision at issue, in which it found, first, that the exemption granted under the ICI rules to non-commercial entities carrying on specific activities on their real property constituted State aid that was incompatible with the internal market and had been unlawfully implemented by the Italian Republic, in breach of Article 108(3) TFEU.", "Next, the Commission considered that, in view of the particular circumstances of the case, it would be absolutely impossible for the Italian Republic to recover the unlawful aid, so that the Commission did not order it to do so in the decision at issue.", "Finally, the Commission found that neither Article 149(4) of the TUIR nor the exemption under the new IMU scheme constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.", "The actions before the General Court and the judgments under appeal", "11", "By applications lodged with the Registry of the General Court on 16 April 2013, Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori each brought an action for the annulment of the decision at issue, in so far as the Commission had found in that decision that it would be impossible for the Italian authorities to recover the aid considered to be unlawful and incompatible with the internal market (‘the first part of the decision at issue’), that Article 149(4) of the TUIR did not constitute State aid (‘the second part of the decision at issue’), and that the same applied to the new IMU scheme (‘the third part of the decision at issue’). 12", "By documents lodged with the Registry of the General Court on 17 July 2013, the Commission raised objections of inadmissibility, which were joined to the substance by orders of the General Court of 29 October 2014.", "13", "In the judgments under appeal the General Court declared both actions admissible under the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, taking the view that the decision at issue was a regulatory act of direct concern to Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori which did not entail implementing measures with respect to them.", "The General Court dismissed both actions on the substance.", "Procedure before the Court of Justice and forms of order sought", "14", "By its appeal in Case C‑622/16 P, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori

IMU did not fall within the scope of Article 107(1) TFEU;", "–", "in any event, set aside those parts of that judgment covered by such grounds of appeal as the Court may find valid and well founded;

appeals in Cases C‑623/16 P and C‑624/16 P, the Commission, supported by the Italian Republic, puts forward a single ground of appeal divided into three parts, arguing that the General Court misinterpreted and misapplied each of the three cumulative conditions in the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU.", "First part", "Arguments of the parties", "20", "The Commission submits that the classification of the decision at issue as a regulatory act is vitiated by errors of law.", "First, the General Court wrongly considered that any non-legislative act of general application is necessarily a regulatory act.", "Second, the General Court wrongly deduced the regulatory nature of the decision at issue from the general application of the national measures which formed its subject matter.", "Third, in that the first part of the decision at issue concerned a limited class of persons, the General Court should not, in any event, have found that all three parts of the decision at issue were of general application.", "21", "Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori disputes those arguments.", "Findings of the Court", "22", "In the first place, it should be recalled that by the Treaty of Lisbon a third limb was added to the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, relaxing the conditions of admissibility of actions for annulment brought by natural and legal persons.", "That limb, without subjecting the admissibility of actions for annulment brought by natural and legal persons to the condition of individual concern, allows such actions to be brought against ‘regulatory acts’ which do not entail implementing measures and are of direct concern to the applicant (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 October 2013, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, C‑583/11 P, EU:C:2013:625, paragraph 57).", "23", "As regards the concept of ‘regulatory acts’, the Court has held that its scope is more restricted than that of the concept of ‘acts’ used in the first and second limbs of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU and refers to acts of acts of general application other than legislative acts (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 October 2013, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, C‑583/11 P, EU:C:2013:625, paragraphs 58 to 61).", "24", "As the Advocate General observes in point 26 of his Opinion, the interpretation supported by the Commission, namely that there are non-legislative acts of general application, such as the decision at issue, that are not covered by the concept of ‘regulatory act’ within the meaning of the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, cannot be accepted.", "There is no basis for that interpretation in the wording, origin or purpose of that provision.", "25", "As regards, first, the wording of the provision, it refers to ‘regulatory acts’ generally and contains no indication that that reference is only to certain kinds or subcategories of those acts.", "26", "As regards, next, the origin of the provision, it appears from the legislative history of Article III‑365(4) of the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, the content of which was repeated in the same words in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, that the addition of the third limb to that provision was intended to broaden the conditions of admissibility of actions for annulment with respect to natural and legal persons, and the only acts of general application for which a restrictive approach was to be maintained were legislative acts (see, in particular, Secretariat of the European Convention, Final report of the discussion circle on the Court of Justice, 25 March 2003 (CONV 636/03, point 22), and Cover note from the Praesidium to the Convention, 12 May 2003 (CONV 734/03, p. 20)).", "27", "As regards, finally, the purpose of the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, as may be seen from paragraphs 22, 23 and 26 above, its objective is to relax the conditions of admissibility of actions for annulment brought by natural and legal persons against all acts of general application, with the exception of those of a legislative nature.", "To remove certain kinds or subcategories of non-legislative acts of general application from the scope of that provision would run counter to that objective.", "28", "Consequently, it must be considered that the concept of ‘regulatory act’ within the meaning of the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU extends to all non-legislative acts of general application.", "Since the decision at issue is not a legislative act, the General Court did not err in law by confining itself, for the purpose of examining the regulatory nature of the three parts of that decision, to assessing whether those parts are of general application.", "29", "In the second place, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an act is of general application if it applies to objectively determined situations and produces legal effects with respect to categories of persons envisaged in a general and abstract manner (judgments of 11 July 1968, Zuckerfabrik Watenstedt v Council, 6/68, EU:C:1968:43, p. 415; of 15 January 2002, Libéros v Commission, C‑171/00 P, EU:C:2002:17, paragraph 28 and the case-law cited; and of 17 March 2011, AJD Tuna, C‑221/09, EU:C:2011:153, paragraph 51 and the case-law cited).", "30", "Article 1(d) of Regulation No 659/1999 defines ‘aid scheme’ as ‘any act on the basis of which, without further implementing measures being required, individual aid awards may be made to undertakings defined within the act in a general and abstract manner and any act on the basis of which aid which is not linked to a specific project may be awarded to one or several undertakings for an indefinite period of time and/or for an indefinite amount’.", "31", "As regards the second limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, the Court has repeatedly held in the field of State aid that decisions of the Commission authorising or prohibiting a national scheme are of general application.", "That general application derives from the fact that such decisions apply to objectively determined situations and produce legal effects with respect to a category of persons envisaged in a general and abstract manner (see, to that effect, judgments of 22 December 2008, British Aggregates v Commission, C‑487/06 P, EU:C:2008:757, paragraph 31; of 17 September 2009, Commission v Koninglijke Friesland/Campina, C‑519/07 P, EU:C:2009:556, paragraph 53 and the case-law cited; and of 28 June 2018, Lowell Financial Services v Commission, C‑219/16 P, not published, EU:C:2018:508, paragraph 42 and the case-law cited).", "32", "As the Advocate General observes in points 48 and 49 of his Opinion, that case-law may be applied to the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU.", "The issue of whether or not an act is of general application concerns an objective characteristic of the act which cannot vary according to the different limbs of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU.", "Moreover, an interpretation according to which an act could at the same time be of general application in relation to the second limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU and not be of general application in relation to the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU would run counter to the objective behind the addition of that provision, which was to relax the conditions of admissibility for annulment actions brought by natural or legal persons.", "33", "Consequently, the General Court did not err in law in considering that the second and third parts of the decision at issue are of general application.", "34", "In the third place, as regards the first part of the decision at issue, it is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, a recovery order is of individual concern to the beneficiaries of the aid scheme in question, in that, once such an order is adopted, they are exposed to the risk that the benefits they have received will be recovered and are therefore members of a restricted class (see, to that effect, judgments of 19 October 2000, Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission, C‑15/98 and C‑105/99, EU:C:2000:570, paragraphs 33 to 35; of 29 April 2004, Italy v Commission, C‑298/00 P, EU:C:2004:240, paragraph 39; and of 9 June 2011, Comitato Venezia vuole vivere and Others v Commission, C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P, EU:C:2011:368, paragraph 56).", "35", "However, contrary to the Commission’s arguments, it cannot be deduced from that case-law that the first part of the decision at issue is not of general application and is therefore not regulatory.", "36", "It follows from that case-law that the fact that that part is of individual concern to the restricted class of beneficiaries of the aid scheme concerned does not preclude that part from being regarded as of general application where it applies to objectively determined situations and produces legal effects for categories of persons envisaged in a general and abstract manner.", "37", "That is so in the present case.", "38", "Since the Commission considered, in the first part of the decision at issue, that it was not appropriate to order the recovery of the aid granted by virtue of the exemption from ICI despite its being unlawful and incompatible with the internal market, that decision preserves the anticompetitive effects of the general and abstract measure which that exemption constitutes with respect to an indefinite number of competitors of the beneficiaries of the aid granted under that measure.", "The decision therefore applies to objectively determined situations and produces legal effects for categories of persons envisaged in a general and abstract manner.", "39", "It follows that the General Court was entitled to consider that the first part of the decision at issue is of general application.", "Consequently, the first part of the single ground of appeal of the Commission’s appeals must be rejected.", "Second part", "Arguments of the parties", "40", "The Commission submits that the General Court erred in law by concluding that Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori were directly concerned on the sole basis that they might potentially compete with the beneficiaries of the national measures in question.", "The General Court’s approach was not consistent with that adopted by the Court in the judgments of 28 April 2015, TL Sugars and Sidul Açúcares v Commission (C‑456/13 P, EU:C:2015:284), and of 17 September 2015, Confederazione Cooperative Italiane and Others v Anicav and Others (C‑455/13 P, C‑457/13 P and C‑460/13 P, not published, EU:C:2015:616).", "To show that he is directly concerned, an applicant must demonstrate that the contested measure entails sufficiently concrete effects on his situation.", "41", "Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori contests those arguments.", "Findings of the Court", "42", "According to settled case-law of the Court, the condition that a natural or legal person must be directly concerned by the decision against which the action is brought, laid down in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, requires two cumulative criteria to be met, namely, first, the contested measure must directly affect the legal situation of the individual and, second, it must leave no discretion to its addressees who are entrusted with the task of implementing it, such implementation being purely automatic and resulting from the EU rules alone without the application of other intermediate rules (judgments of 5 May 1998, Glencore Grain v Commission, C‑404/96 P, EU:C:1998:196, paragraph 41 and the case-law cited; of 13 October 2011, Deutsche Post and Germany v Commission, C‑463/10 P and C‑475/10 P, EU:C:2011:656, paragraph 66; and order of 19 July 2017, Lysoform Dr.", "Hans Rosemann and Ecolab Deutschland v ECHA, C‑666/16 P, not published, EU:C:2017:569, paragraph 42).", "43", "As regards specifically the rules on State aid, it must be noted that their objective is to preserve competition (see, to that effect, judgments of 15 June 2006, Air Liquide Industries Belgium, C‑393/04 and C‑41/05, EU:C:2006:403, paragraph 27 and the case-law cited, and of 17 July 2008, Essent Network Noord and Others, C‑206/06, EU:C:2008:413, paragraph 60).So, in that field, the fact that a Commission decision leaves intact all the effects of the national measures which the applicant, in a complaint addressed to that institution, claimed were not compatible with that objective and placed it in an unfavourable competitive position makes it possible to conclude that the decision directly affects its legal situation, in particular its right under the provisions on State aid of the FEU Treaty not to be subject to competition distorted by the national measures concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 January 1986, Cofaz and Others v Commission, 169/84, EU:C:1986:42, paragraph 30).", "44", "In the present case, with respect to the first of the two criteria mentioned in paragraph 42 above, the General Court considered in substance, in paragraph 42 of the judgment of 15 September 2016, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori v Commission (T‑220/13, not published, EU:T:2016:484), and paragraph 45 of the judgment of 15 September 2016, Ferracci v Commission (T‑219/13, EU:T:2016:485), that it was satisfied because the services offered by Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori respectively were similar to those offered by the beneficiaries of the national measures assessed in the decision at issue and, consequently, the former ‘might be in a competitive relationship’ with the latter.", "45", "As the Commission rightly submits, that reasoning is vitiated by an error of law.", "46", "While it is not for the EU judicature, at the stage of the examination of admissibility, to rule definitively on the competitive relationships between an applicant and the beneficiaries of the national measures assessed in a decision of the Commission on State aid, such as the decision at issue (see, to that effect, judgments of 28 January 1986, Cofaz and Others v Commission, 169/84, EU:C:1986:42, paragraph 28, and of 20 December 2017, Binca Seafoods v Commission, C‑268/16 P, EU:C:2017:1001, paragraph 59), a direct effect on such an applicant cannot be deduced from the mere potential existence of a competitive relationship, such as that found in the judgments under appeal.", "47", "Given that the condition of direct concern requires the contested measure to produce effects directly on the applicant’s legal situation, the EU judicature must ascertain whether the applicant has adequately explained the reasons why the Commission’s decision is liable to place him in an unfavourable competitive position and thus to produce effects on his legal situation.", "48", "It must nonetheless be recalled that, if the grounds of a decision of the General Court reveal an infringement of EU law but the operative part of the judgment can be seen to be well founded on other legal grounds, that infringement is not capable of leading to the annulment of that decision and a substitution of grounds must be made (judgment of 26 July 2017, Council v LTTE, C‑599/14 P, EU:C:2017:583, paragraph 75 and the case-law cited).", "49", "That is the case here.", "50", "It may be seen from the applications brought by Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori before the General Court that they submitted, with evidence in support and without being contradicted by the Commission on this point, that their establishments were situated in the immediate vicinity of ecclesiastical or religious entities carrying on similar activities to theirs which were thus active in the same market for services and the same geographical market.", "In so far as such entities were a priori eligible for the national measures assessed in the decision at issue, it must be considered that Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori have adequately explained the reasons why the decision at issue was liable to place them in an unfavourable competitive position and, consequently, that that decision directly affected their legal situation, in particular their right not to be subject in that market to competition distorted by the measures in question.", "51", "Contrary to the arguments of the Commission, that conclusion is not called into question by the judgments of 28 April 2015, TL Sugars and Sidul Açúcares v Commission (C‑456/13 P, EU:C:2015:284), and of 17 September 2015, Confederazione Cooperative Italiane and Others v Anicav and Others (C‑455/13 P, C‑457/13 P and C‑460/13 P, not published, EU:C:2015:616).", "While the Court held in those judgments that the mere fact that provisions adopted as part of the common agricultural policy place an applicant in an unfavourable competitive position does not in itself allow it to be concluded that those provisions affect the applicant’s legal situation, that line of case-law cannot be transposed to actions brought by competitors of beneficiaries of State aid.", "52", "The cases cited in the preceding paragraph did not concern the rules on State aid, the objective of which is precisely to preserve competition, as noted in paragraph 43 above.", "53", "Consequently, the actions brought by Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori satisfy the first of the two criteria mentioned in paragraph 42 above.", "54", "With respect to the second of those criteria, the General Court considered in paragraph 45 of the judgment of 15 September 2016, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori v Commission (T‑220/13, not published, EU:T:2016:484), and paragraph 48 of the judgment of 15 September 2016, Ferracci v Commission (T‑219/13, EU:T:2016:485), that the decision at issue, both in its first part and in its second and third parts, produces legal effects purely automatically on the basis of the EU rules alone without the application of other intermediate rules.", "As the Advocate General observes in substance in point 52 of his Opinion, that consideration, which is not contested by the Commission in these appeals, is not vitiated by any error of law.", "55", "It follows that the General Court was entitled to consider that Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori were directly concerned by the decision at issue.", "The second part of the single ground of appeal of the Commission’s appeals must therefore be rejected.", "Third part", "Arguments of the parties", "56", "The Commission submits that the General Court erred in law by considering that the national measures implementing the measures that were the subject of the decision at issue did not constitute implementing measures as regards Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori.", "The General Court wrongly rejected its argument that they could have applied for the favourable tax treatment reserved to their competitors and brought proceedings before the national court against a refusal by the authorities, contesting on that occasion the validity of the decision at issue.", "The General Court’s approach was inconsistent with the line of case-law of the Court starting with the judgment of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission (C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852).", "57", "Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori contests those arguments.", "Findings of the Court", "58", "According to settled case-law of the Court, the expression ‘does not entail implementing measures’ within the meaning of the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU must be interpreted in the light of the objective of that provision, which, as is apparent from its drafting history, is to ensure that individuals do not have to break the law in order to have access to a court.", "Where a regulatory act directly affects the legal situation of a natural or legal person without requiring implementing measures, that person could be denied effective judicial protection if he did not have a legal remedy before the EU judicature for the purpose of challenging the lawfulness of the regulatory act.", "In the absence of implementing measures, a natural or legal person, although directly concerned by the act in question, would be able to obtain judicial review of the act only after having infringed its provisions, by pleading that those provisions are unlawful in proceedings initiated against them before the national court (judgments of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraph 27, and of 13 March 2018, European Union Copper Task Force v Commission, C‑384/16 P, EU:C:2018:176, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).", "59", "By contrast, where a regulatory act entails implementing measures, judicial review of compliance with the EU legal order is ensured irrespective of whether those measures were adopted by the European Union or the Member States.", "Natural or legal persons who are unable, because of the conditions of admissibility in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, to challenge an EU regulatory act directly before the EU judicature are protected against the application to them of such an act by the ability to challenge the implementing measures which the act entails (judgments of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraph 28, and of 13 March 2018, European Union Copper Task Force v Commission, C‑384/16 P, EU:C:2018:176, paragraph 36 and the case-law cited).", "60", "Where responsibility for the implementation of such acts lies with the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the European Union, natural or legal persons are entitled to bring a direct action before the EU judicature against the implementing acts under the conditions stated in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, and to plead in support of that action, pursuant to Article 277 TFEU, the unlawfulness of the basic act concerned.", "Where that implementation is a matter for the Member States, those persons may plead the invalidity of the basic act concerned before the national courts and cause them to refer questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling under Article 267 TFEU (judgments of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraph 29, and of 13 March 2018, European Union Copper Task Force v Commission, C‑384/16 P, EU:C:2018:176, paragraph 37 and the case-law cited).", "61", "The Court has, moreover, repeatedly held that the question whether a regulatory act entails implementing measures should be assessed by reference to the position of the person pleading the right to bring proceedings under the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU.", "It is therefore irrelevant whether the act in question entails implementing measures with regard to other persons.", "Furthermore, in that assessment, reference should be made exclusively to the subject matter of the action (see, to that effect, judgments of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraphs 30 and 31; of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonpunt and Others v Commission, C‑132/12 P, EU:C:2014:100, paragraphs 50 and 51; and of 13 March 2018, European Union Copper Task Force v Commission, C‑384/16 P, EU:C:2018:176, paragraphs 38 and 39 and the case-law cited).", "62", "In the present case, in so far as the actions brought by Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori sought the annulment of the first part of the decision at issue, it must be considered, as the Advocate General observes in point 69 of his Opinion, that, the materialisation of the legal effects of the decision not to order recovery of the aid found to be unlawful and incompatible with the internal market, which was the subject of that first part, did not need any implementing measures which could be the subject of judicial review by the EU judicature or the national courts.", "The General Court was therefore entitled to conclude that that part does not entail implementing measures within the meaning of the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU with respect to Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori.", "Nor indeed does the Commission put forward any specific argument to challenge that conclusion.", "63", "As regards the second and third parts of the decision at issue, in which the Commission found that Article 149(4) of the TUIR and the exemption under the IMU scheme did not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, it must be recalled that the Court has indeed repeatedly held that, for the beneficiaries of an aid scheme, the national provisions establishing the scheme and the measures implementing those provisions, such as a tax notice, constitute implementing measures entailed by a decision declaring the aid scheme incompatible with the internal market or declaring it compatible with the internal market subject to compliance with commitments entered into by the Member State concerned (see, to that effect, judgments of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraphs 35 and 36; of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonpunt and Others v Commission, C‑132/12 P, EU:C:2014:100, paragraphs 52 and 53; and of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonlinie and Others v Commission, C‑133/12 P, EU:C:2014:105, paragraphs 39 and 40).", "64", "That case-law reflects the fact that a beneficiary of an aid scheme can, where he satisfies the conditions under national law for being eligible for that scheme, request the national authorities to grant him the aid as it would have been granted if there were an unconditional decision declaring the scheme compatible with the internal market, and contest before the national courts a measure refusing that request, pleading the invalidity of the Commission’s decision declaring the scheme incompatible with the internal market or compatible with that market subject to compliance with commitments entered into by the Member State concerned, in order to cause those courts to refer questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling on its validity (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraphs 36 and 59, and order of 15 January 2015, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and Telefónica v Commission, C‑587/13 P and C‑588/13 P, not published, EU:C:2015:18, paragraphs 49 and 65).", "65", "However, that case-law cannot be applied to the situation of the competitors of beneficiaries of a national measure that has been found not to constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, such as Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori.", "The situation of such a competitor differs from that of the beneficiaries of aid referred to by that case-law, in that the competitor does not satisfy the conditions laid down by the national measure in question for eligibility for that aid.", "66", "In those circumstances, as the Advocate General observes in point 71 of his Opinion, it would be artificial to require that competitor to request the national authorities to grant him that benefit and to contest the refusal of that request before a national court, in order to cause the national court to make a reference to the Court on the validity of the Commission’s decision concerning that measure.", "67", "The General Court was therefore entitled to find that the decision at issue did not, either in its first or in its second and third parts, comprise implementing measures with respect to Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori and Mr Ferracci.", "68", "Consequently, the third part of the single ground of appeal of the Commission’s appeals must be rejected, and those appeals must therefore be dismissed in their entirety.", "Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori’s appeal in Case C‑622/16 P", "First ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "69", "Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori’s first ground of appeal, criticising the General Court for finding the first part of the decision at issue valid, is divided into four parts.", "By the first part, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori argues that the General Court infringed Article 108 TFEU, Article 14(1) of Regulation No 659/1999 and Article 4(3) TEU by accepting that the Commission was entitled to find that it was absolutely impossible to recover unlawful aid even at the stage of the formal investigation procedure, and not solely at the stage of enforcement of an order for recovery.", "Absolute impossibility of recovering unlawful aid is not a general principle of law within the meaning of the second sentence of Article 14(1) of Regulation No 659/1999.", "70", "By the second and third parts, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori submits that the General Court misinterpreted the concept of ‘absolute impossibility’ by ruling that the first part of the decision at issue was valid, in so far as the Commission derived the absolute impossibility of recovering the unlawful aid in question from the sole fact that it was not possible to obtain the necessary information for the recovery of that aid from the Italian land registry and tax databases.", "That circumstance was a purely internal difficulty which, in accordance with the Court’s case-law, could not allow the conclusion that recovery of the aid was absolutely impossible.", "71", "Furthermore, the General Court disregarded the burden of proof by rejecting Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori’s arguments on the existence of alternative means which would have allowed the recovery of the aid in question.", "According to Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori, it was not for it to show that it was possible to recover the aid, but for the Italian Republic to cooperate sincerely with the Commission by indicating alternative methods allowing it to be recovered, even if only in part.", "72", "By the fourth part, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori criticises the General Court for distorting the evidence by finding that it was impossible to obtain the necessary information for the recovery of the aid in question from the Italian land registry and tax databases.", "73", "The Commission, supported by the Italian Republic, contends with respect to the first part that the absence of an order for recovery in the decision at issue is consistent with Article 14(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, which prohibits the Commission from ordering the recovery of unlawful aid where recovery is contrary to a general principle of EU law.", "By virtue of the general legal principle that ‘no one is obliged to do the impossible’, the Commission cannot impose an obligation the performance of which is objectively and absolutely impossible.", "74", "With respect to the second and third parts, the Commission submits that absolute impossibility of recovering unlawful aid may also derive from the national rules concerned.", "The argument that alternative methods exist which would have permitted recovery of the aid calls in question findings of fact which cannot be the subject of an appeal.", "The burden of proof for showing the existence of such methods was, in accordance with general principles, on Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori, which relied on their existence.", "75", "With respect to the fourth part, the argument concerning distortion of evidence is inadmissible and in any event unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "76", "As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it must be recalled that in accordance with the first sentence of Article 14(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, where negative decisions are taken in cases of unlawful aid, the Commission is to decide that the Member State concerned shall take all necessary measures to recover the aid from the beneficiary.", "77", "It is settled case-law that the adoption of an order to recover unlawful aid is the logical and normal consequence of a finding that it is unlawful.", "The principal objective of such an order is to eliminate the distortion of competition caused by the competitive advantage conferred by the unlawful aid (see, to that effect, judgments of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774, paragraph 113 and the case-law cited; of 1 October 2015, Electrabel and Dunamenti Erőmű v Commission, C‑357/14 P, EU:C:2015:642, paragraph 111 and the case-law cited; and of 21 December 2016, Commission v Aer Lingus and Ryanair Designated Activity, C‑164/15 P and C‑165/15 P, EU:C:2016:990, paragraph 116).", "78", "However, in accordance with the second sentence of Article 14(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, the Commission shall not require the recovery of the aid if this would be contrary to a general principle of EU law.", "79", "As the Advocate General observes in points 107 and 110 of his Opinion, the principle that ‘no one is obliged to do the impossible’ is among the general principles of EU law (see, to that effect, order of 3 March 2016, Daimler, C‑179/15, EU:C:2016:134, paragraph 42).", "80", "While it follows from settled case-law of the Court that the only defence that may be relied on by a Member State against an action for failure to fulfil obligations brought by the Commission on the basis of Article 108(2) TFEU is the absolute impossibility of implementing correctly the Commission’s decision to order recovery of the aid in question (see, to that effect, judgments of 15 January 1986, Commission v Belgium, 52/84, EU:C:1986:3, paragraph 14; of 1 June 2006, Commission v Italy, C‑207/05, not published, EU:C:2006:366, paragraph 45; and of 9 November 2017, Commission v Greece, C‑481/16, not published, EU:C:2017:845, paragraph 28 and the case-law cited), that case-law relates, however, solely to the pleas that can be raised in defence by the Member State against an order for recovery made by the Commission, not to whether or not the absolute impossibility of recovering the aid may already be established at the stage of the formal investigation procedure.", "81", "Moreover, and above all, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori’s argument that the absolute impossibility of recovering unlawful aid can be established only after the adoption of an order for recovery conflicts with the very wording of the second sentence of Article 14(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, under which the Commission is not to adopt an order for recovery if that would be contrary to a general principle of EU law.", "82", "The Court has previously held that the Commission cannot, on pain of its being invalid, adopt an order for recovery which, from the moment of its adoption, is objectively and absolutely impossible to implement (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 June 1999, Belgium v Commission, C‑75/97, EU:C:1999:311, paragraph 86).", "83", "In so far as Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori also bases the first part of its first ground of appeal on the principle of sincere cooperation, it must be recalled that under Article 4(3) TEU that principle applies throughout the procedure for the examination of a measure by reference to the provisions of EU law on State aid (see, to that effect, judgments of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited, and of 21 December 2016, Club Hotel Loutraki and Others v Commission, C‑131/15 P, EU:C:2016:989, paragraph 34).", "84", "Thus where, as in the present case, the Member State concerned already claims during the formal investigation procedure that recovery is absolutely impossible, the principle of sincere cooperation requires the Member State, at that stage, to submit to the Commission for assessment the reasons underlying that claim and requires the Commission to examine them scrupulously.Consequently, contrary to Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori’s submission, that principle does not require the Commission to attach an order for recovery to every decision declaring aid to be unlawful and incompatible with the internal market, but requires it to take into consideration the arguments put to it by the Member State concerned on the existence of absolute impossibility of recovery.", "85", "It follows that the first part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected.", "86", "As regards the fourth part of this ground of appeal, it should be recalled that an appellant must, pursuant to Article 256 TFEU, the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 168(1)(d) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, indicate precisely the evidence alleged to have been distorted by the General Court and demonstrate the errors of appraisal which, in his view, led to that distortion.", "In addition, it is settled case-law of the Court that the distortion must be obvious from the documents in the case file without there being any need to carry out a new assessment of the facts and the evidence (see, to that effect, judgments of 9 June 2011, Comitato Venezia vuole vivere and Others v Commission, C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P, EU:C:2011:368, paragraphs 152 and 153, and of 8 March 2016, Greece v Commission, C‑431/14 P, EU:C:2016:145, paragraph 32 and the case-law cited).", "87", "In the present case, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori mentions only, in this fourth part, the Commission’s reply of 17 September 2015 to a question asked by the General Court as a measure of organisation of procedure, referred to in paragraph 100 of the judgment of 15 September 2016, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori v Commission (T‑220/13, not published, EU:T:2016:484), in which the Commission described the provisions of the Italian legislation on tax databases.", "88", "It must be stated, first, that Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori does not challenge in any way the presentation of the material content of that evidence in paragraphs 101 and 102 of that judgment, but confines itself to calling in question the assessment made by the General Court on the basis of that content.Second, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori has not shown in what way the General Court’s assessment that the Italian tax databases did not make it possible retroactively to trace the kind of activities carried on by entities enjoying the exemption from ICI for their real property, or to calculate the amount of the unlawfully obtained exemptions, appears manifestly erroneous.", "89", "The fourth part of the first ground of appeal cannot therefore succeed.", "90", "As regards the second and third parts of this ground of appeal, which should be considered together, it must be recalled that, in accordance with the Court’s settled case-law on actions for failure to fulfil obligations brought on the ground of infringement of a decision ordering the recovery of unlawful aid, a Member State which encounters unforeseen and unforeseeable difficulties or becomes aware of consequences overlooked by the Commission must submit those problems to the Commission for consideration, together with proposals for suitable amendments to the decision at issue.", "In such a case, the Member State and the Commission must, by virtue of the principle of sincere cooperation, work together in good faith with a view to overcoming difficulties while fully observing the provisions of the FEU Treaty, in particular those on aid (see, to that effect, judgments of 2 July 2002, Commission v Spain, C‑499/99, EU:C:2002:408, paragraph 24, and of 22 December 2010, Commission v Italy, C‑304/09, EU:C:2010:812, paragraph 37 and the case-law cited).", "91", "However, the condition of absolute impossibility of implementation is not satisfied where the defendant Member State does no more than inform the Commission of the internal difficulties of a legal, political or practical nature, attributable to the national authorities’ own acts or omissions, raised by implementation of the decision at issue, without taking real steps to recover the aid from the undertakings concerned and without suggesting to the Commission alternative methods of implementing the decision which would allow those difficulties to be overcome (see, to that effect, judgments of 13 November 2008, Commission v France, C‑214/07, EU:C:2008:619, paragraph 50, and of 12 February 2015, Commission v France, C‑37/14, not published, EU:C:2015:90, paragraph 66 and the case-law cited).", "92", "That case-law is applicable mutatis mutandis to the assessment during the formal investigation procedure of whether it is absolutely impossible to recover unlawful aid.", "Thus a Member State which at that stage of the procedure encounters difficulties in recovering the aid concerned must submit those difficulties to the Commission for consideration and cooperate in good faith with the Commission with a view to overcoming them, in particular by suggesting alternative methods allowing recovery, if only in part, of the aid.", "In all cases, the Commission is required to undertake a detailed examination of the difficulties pleaded and the suggested alternative methods of recovery.", "Only if the Commission finds, following such a detailed examination, that there are no alternative methods allowing even partial recovery of the unlawful aid in question may that recovery be considered to be objectively and absolutely impossible to carry out.", "93", "In the present case, it follows from paragraphs 76 and 85 of the General Court’s judgment of 15 September 2016, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori v Commission (T‑220/13, not published, EU:T:2016:484), that the Commission confined itself, in the first part of the decision at issue, to deducing the absolute impossibility of recovering the unlawful aid in question solely from the fact that it was not possible to obtain the necessary information for recovery of the aid from the Italian land registry and tax databases, while omitting to consider the possible existence of alternative methods allowing recovery, if only in part, of the aid.", "94", "By upholding the decision on this point, the General Court erred in law.", "95", "As the Advocate General observes in points 116 and 117 of his Opinion, the circumstance that the information needed for recovery of the unlawful aid in question could not be obtained from the Italian land registry and tax databases must be regarded as caused by internal difficulties attributable to the national authorities’ own acts or omissions.", "According to the settled case-law of the Court cited in paragraph 91 above, such internal difficulties do not suffice for it to be concluded that there is absolute impossibility of recovery.", "96", "As may be seen from paragraphs 90 to 92 above, recovery of unlawful aid may be considered to be objectively and absolutely impossible only if the Commission finds, following a detailed examination, that two cumulative conditions are satisfied, namely that the difficulties relied on by the Member State concerned are real and that there are no alternative methods of recovery.", "As noted in paragraph 93 above, the General Court upheld the first part of the decision at issue despite the fact that the Commission had omitted to carry out, in that decision, a detailed examination of whether the second of those conditions was met.", "97", "The error of law which thus vitiates the General Court’s judgment of 15 September 2016, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori v Commission (T‑220/13, not published, EU:T:2016:484), overlaps with that also committed by the General Court by rejecting, in paragraphs 86 and 104 to 110 of that judgment, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori’s argument that the Commission should have examined the existence of alternative methods enabling recovery, if only in part, of the aid in question, on the ground that Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori had not been able to demonstrate their existence.", "98", "In so far as Article 14(1) of Regulation No 659/1999 requires the Commission, as a general rule, to adopt an order to recover unlawful aid and allows it to refrain from doing so only exceptionally, it was for the Commission to show in the decision at issue that the conditions for it to decline to adopt such an order were satisfied, not for Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori to prove before the General Court that there existed alternative methods enabling recovery, if only in part, of the aid in question.", "In those circumstances, the General Court could not confine itself to observing that Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori had not succeeded before it in showing that such alternative methods existed. 99", "Consequently, the second and third parts of the first ground of appeal must be allowed and the remainder of the ground of appeal must be rejected.", "Second ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "100", "Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori submits that the General Court erred in law by holding that the exemption from IMU which is the subject of the third part of the decision at issue did not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU on the ground that the exemption did not apply to economic activities.", "In this respect, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori argues that the General Court disregarded the case-law of the Court in rejecting its argument that the activities covered by that exemption were provided for consideration, on the ground that the exemption applies only to educational activities provided free of charge or against payment of a token amount.", "By defining as ‘token’ an amount that covers a fraction of the actual cost of the service, the Italian legislation allows the exemption to be granted to operators who finance their educational services primarily from the consideration they receive from pupils or their parents.", "101", "Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori further criticises the General Court for holding that the non-applicability of the exemption from IMU to economic activities is also ensured by the fact that the exemption extends only to activities which by their nature are not in competition with the activities of other operators who seek a profit.", "That fact is of no relevance to educational activities, since they compete by their nature with the activities of other operators in the market.", "102", "The Commission and the Italian Republic contest those arguments.", "Findings of the Court", "103", "According to the Court’s settled case-law, EU competition law, in particular the prohibition in Article 107(1) TFEU, applies to the activities of undertakings.", "In this context, the concept of ‘undertaking’ covers any entity engaged in an economic activity, regardless of its legal status and the way in which it is financed (see, to that effect, judgments of 10 January 2006, Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others, C‑222/04, EU:C:2006:8, paragraph 107, and of 27 June 2017, Congregación de Escuelas Pías Provincia Betania, C‑74/16, EU:C:2017:496, paragraphs 39 and 41 and the case-law cited).", "104", "Any activity consisting in offering services on a given market, that is, services normally provided for remuneration, is an economic activity.", "The essential characteristic of remuneration lies in the fact that it is consideration for the service in question (see, to that effect, judgments of 11 September 2007, Schwarz and Gootjes-Schwarz, C‑76/05, EU:C:2007:492, paragraphs 37 and 38, and of 27 June 2017, Congregación de Escuelas Pías Provincia Betania, C‑74/16, EU:C:2017:496, paragraphs 45 and 47).", "105", "As regards educational activities, the Court has held that courses provided by educational establishments financed essentially by private funds that do not come from the provider itself constitute services, since the aim of such establishments is to offer a service for remuneration (judgment of 27 June 2017, Congregación de Escuelas Pías Provincia Betania, C‑74/16, EU:C:2017:496, paragraph 48 and the case-law cited).", "106", "In the present case, the General Court found in paragraphs 136 and 140 of the judgment of 15 September 2016, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori v Commission (T‑220/13, not published, EU:T:2016:484), that the exemption from IMU applied only to educational activities provided free of charge or against payment of a token amount covering only part of the actual cost of the service, with that part not being related to the cost.", "107", "It must be recalled that, in the case of an interpretation of national law by the General Court, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction on appeal only to determine whether that law was distorted, and the distortion must be obvious from the documents in the case file (judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraph 20 and the case-law cited).", "108", "As Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori does not claim that there was distortion, its argument that the Italian legislation allows the exemption from IMU to be granted to educational activities that are financed primarily by pupils or their parents must be rejected at the outset as inadmissible.", "109", "As to Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori’s argument that the General Court disregarded the Court’s case-law cited in paragraphs 103 to 105 above, it must be considered that, as the Advocate General observes in points 142 to 144 of his Opinion, since the General Court found in its interpretation of national law that the exemption from IMU applies only to educational activities provided free of charge or against payment of a token amount not related to the cost of the service, it was able to reject, without committing an error of law, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori’s complaint that the exemption applied to educational services provided for remuneration.", "110", "In so far as Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori additionally criticises the General Court for holding that the non-applicability of the exemption from IMU to economic activities is also ensured by the fact that the exemption extends only to activities which by their nature are not in competition with the activities of other operators who seek a profit, its argument must be rejected as ineffective, since it relates to a ground included for the sake of completeness.", "111", "It follows that the second ground of appeal must be rejected.", "112", "Since the second and third parts of the first ground of appeal have, however, been allowed, the judgment of 15 September 2016, Scuola Elementare Maria

the proceedings so permits.", "114", "That is so in the present case.", "115", "It suffices to observe that, as Scuola Elementare Maria Montesori submits in substance in its first plea in law, the first part of the decision at issue is vitiated by an error of law for the reasons set out in paragraphs 90 to 99 above, in so far as the Commission found that it was absolutely impossible to recover the unlawful aid granted by virtue of the ICI scheme without examining scrupulously all the conditions required by the Court’s case-law for it to be possible to make such a finding.", "116",

"Judgment", "Grounds", "1 By application lodged at the Registry of the Court of Justice on 26 March 1998, the French Republic brought an appeal pursuant to Article 49 of the EC Statute of the Court of Justice against the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 27 January 1998 in Case T-67/94 Ladbroke Racing v Commission [1998] ECR II-1 (the judgment under appeal), by which the Court of First Instance had annulled in part Commission Decision 93/625/EEC of 22 September 1993 concerning aid granted by the French authorities to the Pari Mutuel Urbain (PMU) and to the racecourse undertakings (OJ 1993 L 300, p. 15; the contested decision).", "Facts and procedure before the Court of First Instance", "2 In the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance made the following findings of fact:", "1 The applicant, Ladbroke Racing Ltd (hereinafter \"Ladbroke\"), is a company incorporated under English law and controlled by Ladbroke Group plc whose activities include organising and providing betting services in connection with horse-races in the United Kingdom and other countries in the European Community.", "2 The Pari Mutuel Urbain (\"the PMU\") is an economic interest group (groupement d'intérêt économique) consisting of the principal racecourse undertakings (sociétés de courses) in France (Article 21 of Decree 83-878 of 4 October 1983 concerning racecourse undertakings and totalisator betting), which was set up to manage the organisation of off-course totalisator betting on behalf of its members.", "In discharging that responsibility, the PMU's status was initially that of a \"joint administrative department\" (decree of 11 July 1930 extending totalisator betting to off-course operations).", "Article 13 of Decree 74-954 of 14 November 1974 concerning the racecourse undertakings provides that as from that date the PMU alone may manage the organisation of off-course totalisator betting by the racecourse undertakings.", "The PMU's exclusive position is further safeguarded by the preclusion of persons other than the PMU from offering to receive or receiving bets on horse-races (Article 8 of the Interministerial Order of 13 September 1985 laying down rules for the PMU).", "It covers the taking of bets on races in France and bets in France on races abroad, services which likewise can be offered only by the racecourse undertakings which are authorised to do so and/or the PMU (Article 15(3) of Law 64-1279 of 23 December 1964 laying down the Finance Law for 1965, and Article 21 of Decree 83-878, cited above).", "3 On 7 April 1989 seven companies belonging to the Ladbroke Group, including the applicant, submitted a complaint to the Commission in respect of several forms of aid which the French authorities had granted to the PMU and which those companies maintained were incompatible with the common market.", "...", "5 By letter of 11 January 1991, the Commission informed the French authorities of its decision to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 93(2) of the EEC Treaty in respect of the following seven categories of aid granted to the PMU (OJ 1991 C 38, p. 3):", "\"1. cash-flow benefits represented by the deferring of the periods for the payment of the Treasury levy, as from 1980 and 1981;", "2. waiving of [FRF] 180 million of the levies for 1986;", "3. exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT;", "4. use of unclaimed winnings to pay an additional redundancy allowance in 1985;", "5. exemption from the housing levy;", "6. waiving from 1982 to 1985 of amounts deriving from the practice of rounding bettors' winnings down to the nearest ten centimes;", "7. exemption from corporation tax.\"", "...", "13 On 22 September 1993 the Commission adopted [the contested decision], terminating the procedure initiated against France.", "...", "16 In the contested decision, the Commission drew a distinction between two types of sums collected on horse-race betting, namely \"levies\" or \"public levies\" (\"prélèvements publics\"), which go to the Treasury, and \"non-public levies\", which are distributed between bettors.", "According to the contested decision, for every [FRF] 100 in registered bets, the PMU levies about [FRF] 30 and pays back about [FRF] 70 to the bettors.", "Of the [FRF] 30 withheld, the PMU uses about [FRF] 5.5 to cover its expenses, the national authorities and the City of Paris retain about [FRF] 18, and the rest is allocated to the racecourse undertakings.", "17 The Commission went on to point out that whereas the markets in games of chance have traditionally been partitioned along national lines, betting on horse-races on national courses is organised internationally, and it was not until January 1989, when the Pari Mutuel International (\"the PMI\") was set up, that the PMU expressly made clear its desire to extend its activities beyond France by concluding agreements in Germany and Belgium, and by thereby entering into competition with other betting organisations and particularly with Ladbroke (part III of the contested decision).", "18 Of the seven measures adopted by the French Government in favour of the PMU with regard to which the procedure under Article 93(2) of the Treaty was initiated, three were identified by the Commission as State aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.", "19 The Commission considered that the waiver between 1982 and 1985 of part of the levy ([FRF] 315 million) on the amount deriving from the practice of rounding down bettors' winnings to the nearest ten centimes - allocated to the Treasury since 1967, pursuant to the Finance Law of 17 December 1966 - constituted aid since it was a \"measure limited in time and intended to solve a specific problem\", namely computerisation of the PMU's operations in order to assist it in strengthening its market position (parts IV and V, point 2).", "20 It also regarded the exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT as a cash-flow benefit equivalent to State aid; however, the Commission found that this had been offset between 1989 and its abolition on 1 July 1993 by a permanent deposit lodged with the French Treasury (parts IV and V, point 6).", "21 Lastly, as regards the PMU's exemption from the social housing levy, the Commission considered that, even though the Conseil d'État held in a 1962 judgment that horse-racing was an agricultural activity and therefore exempt from such contributions, the PMU's activity - organising and processing bets - fell manifestly outside the scope of agricultural activities.", "Accordingly, since the exemption at issue was not justified under the PMU's articles of association, it constituted State aid (parts IV and V, point 7).", "22 However, the Commission considered that the three forms of aid in question qualified for exemption under Article 92(3)(c) of the Treaty.", "23 As regards the aid resulting from the waiver of the amounts deriving from the practice of rounding down winnings to the nearest ten centimes, the Commission took the view that, although the intensity of that aid was high (almost 29% of the total cost of computerisation), \"given the state of development of competition and trade before the setting-up of the PMI in January 1989, the aid granted between 1982 and 1985 for the computerisation of the PMU did not produce any disruptive effects on the market contrary to the common interest, bearing in mind the direct and indirect effects of the aid in developing all the economic factors making up the sector, including the improvement of bloodstock\" (part VII, point 1).", "24 In the case of the exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT, the Commission took the view that - for the same reasons as were cited in connection with the aid just referred to - it had likewise to be regarded as compatible with the common market up to January 1989.", "Thereafter, any adverse effects of that aid on competition were offset in full by a permanent deposit lodged with the Treasury (part VII, point 2).", "25 As for the aid attributable to the exemption from the housing levy, the Commission considered that, like the aid resulting from the exemption from the one-month delay rule for deduction of VAT, it qualified up to 1989 for the derogation provided for in Article 92(3)(c); thereafter, however, it had to be declared incompatible (part VII, point 3).", "26 However, with regard to the obligation to repay the aid obtained in that form as of 1989, the Commission stated that \"... repayment as from that date should not be required in view of the French authorities' argument that the contribution could not be levied because of the 1962 decision of the Conseil d'État referred to in part IV, point 7\" (see above, paragraph 21); none the less, \"[that] argument cannot be accepted as from the time when the initiation of proceedings was notified to the French authorities, namely on 11 January 1991\".", "The Commission also stated that it had not been given the means to quantify for itself the amount of aid to be recovered and requested the French authorities to determine themselves and communicate to the Commission such amount (part VIII).", "27 In the case of the other four measures, the Commission decided that the conditions laid down for the application of Article 92(1) of the Treaty were not satisfied.", "28 As regards the amounts resulting from unclaimed winnings, the Commission considered that, in so far as those amounts have always been regarded as normal resources, they form part of the non-public levies.", "Their use to finance in particular social security expenditure together with monitoring and supervision costs, horse-breeding incentives and investment connected with the organisation of horse-racing and totalisator betting cannot therefore be regarded as State aid, since the State resources criterion is not met (parts IV and V, point 1).", "29 As regards the change in the allocation of the public levies (see above, paragraph 16), the Commission stated that the tax arrangements applicable to horse-races are the responsibility of the Member States and increases or reductions in the rate of tax do not constitute State aid provided that they apply uniformly to all the undertakings concerned.", "The question of State aid arises only where a significant reduction in the rate of taxation strengthens the financial situation of an undertaking in a monopoly position.", "That was not the case here, however, in so far as the 1984 reduction in the public levy on bets was limited (some 1.6%) and subsequently maintained, and was thus not designed to finance a specific ad hoc operation.", "The French authorities acted with the aim of increasing the resources of the recipients of the non-public levies on a permanent basis.", "Taking account of the special nature of the recipients' situation, the measure in question did not constitute State aid, but a \"reform in the form of a tax adjustment that is justified by the nature and economy of the system in question\" (parts IV and V, point 3).", "30 As regards the PMU's exemption from corporation tax, the Commission took the view that, in so far as corporation tax \"cannot apply to the [economic interest group] PMU since its legal form is that of an economic interest grouping\", the exemption must \"be considered to stem from the normal application of the general tax system\" (part V, point 4).", "31 Regarding the cash-flow benefit - amounting to nearly two months' additional resources - deriving from the deferral allowed in the payment of the public levies, which was granted to the PMU by decisions of the Minister for the Budget of 24 April 1980 and 19 February 1982, the Commission considered that in so far as that advantage had had the effect of increasing the share of the non-public levies continuously since 1981, it did not involve \"a temporary waiving of resources by the public authorities or a specific ad hoc measure\", and accordingly fell to be assessed in the same way as the change in the allocation of the levies (see above, paragraph 29) (parts IV and V, point 5).", "3 It was in those circumstances that Ladbroke brought an application before the Court of First Instance for annulment of the contested decision in so far as the Commission had decided therein:", "(1) that the following measures fell outside the scope of Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 87(1) EC):", "(a) cash-flow benefits allowing the PMU to defer the payment of certain betting levies to the State;", "(b) exemption from corporation tax;", "(c) exemption from income tax;", "(d) waiver of FRF 180 million of betting levies in 1986;", "(e) the PMU's entitlement to retain unclaimed winnings;", "(f) exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT from 1 January 1989 onwards;", "(2) that the following measures were compatible with the common market pursuant to Article 92 of the Treaty:", "(a) the rounding down of bettors' winnings to the nearest ten centimes between 1982 and 1985, representing FRF 315 million;", "(b) the exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT prior to 1 January 1989;", "(c) the exemption from the housing levy prior to 1 January 1989;", "(3)(a) that there should be no repayment of aid granted to the PMU in the form of exemption from the housing levy in respect of the period prior to 11 January 1991;", "(b) that the Commission had no obligation to determine itself the amount of the aid in respect of the exemption from the housing levy that it ordered to be repaid from 11 January 1991.", "The judgment under appeal", "4 In the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance held that in the case of decisions as to whether a measure is to be characterised as State aid, which, under the Treaty, are the responsibility of both the Commission and the national courts, there is in principle no reason to attribute a broad discretion to the Commission in the absence of special circumstances arising from the complex nature of the State intervention in question.", "It also pointed out that, while both tax legislation and the implementation of tax arrangements are matters for the national authorities, the exercise of that competence may nevertheless, in certain cases, prove to be incompatible with Article 92(1) of the Treaty (paragraphs 51 to 54).", "5 In the light of those considerations, the Court of First Instance first examined the three criteria used by the Commission to determine whether the change in the allocation of levies in 1985 and 1986 fell within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty (paragraphs 55 to 66).", "According to the contested decision, the measure in question (a) was merely a limited reduction in the rate of the levy (approximately 1.6%) and did not strengthen the financial situation of a monopoly undertaking, (b) was ongoing in character and (c) was not aimed at financing an ad hoc operation but at increasing the resources of the recipients of the non-public levies (see paragraph 51).", "6 The Court held that the three criteria, as applied in this instance, were not such as to justify the finding by the Commission that the reduction in the levy rate was not State aid for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty but should be classed as a reform in the form of a tax adjustment that was justified by the nature and scheme of the system in question (paragraph 62).", "7 Second, with regard to the cash-flow facilities enabling the PMU to defer payment of certain betting levies, the Court of First Instance found that the mere fact that the measure in question belonged to a separate system intended to apply solely to the sector concerned, and did not fall within the derogations from the general fiscal arrangements, did not remove it from the ambit of Article 92(1) of the Treaty (paragraphs 74 to 77).", "8 The Court declared that any State measure, whether permanent or temporary, which has the effect of granting financial advantages to an undertaking and improving its financial position falls within the definition of State aid for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty and, accordingly, the question whether a change in the rules for allocation of the levies is temporary or permanent is not an adequate test for determining whether that provision applies in a particular case (paragraph 78).", "9 As for the fact that the change in the rules concerning payment to the Treasury of the public levies did not constitute an ad hoc derogation but was a general amendment to the tax regime for the entire horse-racing sector, the Court observed that, contrary to the Commission's assertion, there was no statement to that effect in the contested decision, according to which the Minister for the Budget had allowed the payments due to the Treasury to be deferred solely in the case of the PMU.", "The fact that, as a general rule, the operation of the pari mutuel in France could benefit not only members of the PMU but also, indirectly, non-member companies, could not be regarded as decisive (paragraph 79).", "10 With respect to the Commission's argument that the State intervention in question was made in the context of the exceptionally heavy taxation of the horse-racing sector, which was considerably higher than in other sectors, the Court found that that argument, put forward for the first time before it and unsupported by adequate evidence, was not sufficient in itself to show that the Commission's view was well founded (paragraph 81).", "11 Third, with regard to the PMU's access to unclaimed winnings, the Court of First Instance held that resources of that kind could not be regarded as normal resources belonging to the racecourse undertakings and the PMU, but constituted State resources, the allocation of which to the Treasury depended on whether certain statutory conditions were met (paragraphs 105 to 108).", "The same conclusion could be inferred from the decision of the French legislature to extend the range of uses to which unclaimed winnings could be put to certain activities of a social nature carried on by the racecourse undertakings (paragraphs 109 and 110).", "12 Consequently, the Commission's finding that although the measure in question was designed to finance social expenditure of the racecourse undertakings linked to the organisation of totalisator betting it did not constitute State aid because no transfer of State resources was involved was based on false premisses (paragraph 111).", "13 Fourth, so far as concerns the exemption from the one-month delay rule for VAT deductions as from 1 January 1989, the Court of First Instance found that it was clear from the file that, as conceded by the Commission at the hearing, the permanent deposit with the French Treasury which the racecourse undertakings had been required to lodge in return for the exemption granted to them on 1 August 1969 had existed not since 1989 but since 1969, and that the contested decision was therefore vitiated on that point by a manifest error (paragraphs 118 and 119).", "14 In the absence of a detailed examination by the Commission of the question whether, before 1989, the permanent deposit had offset the cash-flow benefits resulting from the alteration to the time for the deduction of VAT, the Court considered that it could not rule as to whether State aid was involved.", "Since the Commission's assessment of the measure in question was in any event vitiated by error, the Court held that the applicant's claims had to be upheld and that the contested decision had to be annulled in that regard (paragraphs 120, 121 and 122).", "15 Finally, with regard to the obligation to recover aid incompatible with the common market, the Court of First Instance considered whether the Commission, when it adopts a decision instructing the Member State concerned to recover such aid, may restrict the effects in time of that decision on the ground that the Member State considers that a judgment delivered by a domestic court was liable to give rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of the recipient of the aid that the latter was lawful (paragraph 180).", "16 After reviewing the relevant case-law, the Court held that it is not for the Member State concerned, but for the recipient undertaking, in the context of proceedings before the public authorities or before the national courts, to plead exceptional circumstances on the basis of which it had entertained legitimate expectations, justifying refusal to repay unlawful aid (paragraphs 179 to 184).", "Accordingly, in so far as the contested decision limited the temporal scope of the French authorities' obligation to require repayment of aid not to the period commencing in 1989 (the date from which it was declared incompatible), but to the period commencing with the opening of the procedure on 11 January 1991, it was vitiated by infringement of Article 93(2) of the EC Treaty (now Article 88(2) EC) (paragraph 185).", "17 The Court of First Instance consequently annulled the contested decision in so far as it had found:", "- first, that various advantages granted to the PMU, through", "(a) the amendment in 1985 and 1986 of the allocation of the levies,", "(b) cash-flow benefits granted to it by the authorisation to defer payment of certain levies on betting,", "(c) access to unclaimed winnings, and", "(d) exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of value added tax, after 1 January 1989,", "did not constitute State aid for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty;", "- second, that the obligation on the French authorities to require repayment of the aid deriving from the PMU's exemption from the housing levy applied not as from 1989, but as from 11 January 1991.", "18 The remainder of the action was dismissed and each party was ordered to bear its own costs.", "The appeal", "19 The French Republic relies on two grounds of appeal, which are founded on errors of law allegedly made by the Court of First Instance in the application of Articles 92(1) and (2) and 93(2) of the Treaty.", "First ground of appeal", "20 By its first ground of appeal, which is in four parts, the appellant challenges the judgment of the Court of First Instance in so far as it found that the contested decision was defective in that it excluded from the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty the measures relating to (i) the amendment in 1985 and 1986 of the allocation of betting levies, (ii) the cash-flow benefits granted to the PMU as a result of the authorisation to defer payment of certain of those levies, (iii) the PMU's access to winnings unclaimed by bettors and (iv) the exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT in respect of the period after 1 January 1989.", "21 In the first part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant contends that the Court of First Instance made several errors of law in holding that the three criteria relied on by the Commission in declining to categorise the measure concerning the reduction in the public levies for the benefit of the PMU as State aid were not an appropriate basis for ruling out the existence of aid for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.", "22 The appellant maintains, first of all, that in reaching that conclusion the Court of First Instance gave insufficient grounds, contrary to Article 190 of the EC Treaty (now Article 253 EC), for certain steps in its reasoning, that it failed to adopt a position with regard to certain crucial factors relied on both by the Commission, in the contested decision and in its pleadings before the Court of First Instance, and by the appellant itself, in its statement in intervention, and that it based part of its reasoning on false premisses.", "23 It should be noted at the outset that the appellant's argument relates to the nature and scope of review of the Commission's assessment as to whether a measure adopted by national authorities is to be categorised as State aid.", "24 According to the appellant, the particular nature of the review of State aid means that, when the court carrying out the review is called on to assess the facts of the case in the light of legal criteria, it must limit itself to satisfying itself that there is no manifest error of assessment.", "That form of review cannot be reserved for special circumstances, whose existence is in any event often difficult to ascertain.", "Consequently, the Court of First Instance erred in law in its definition of the nature of the review which it was to carry out in that it stated, in essence, that in the absence of special circumstances, arising in particular from the complex nature of the State intervention in question, review by it is not to be confined to determining whether there has been a manifest error of assessment as to whether aid is involved.", "25 The short answer to that is that State aid, as defined in the Treaty, is a legal concept which must be interpreted on the basis of objective factors.", "For that reason, the Community courts must in principle, having regard both to the specific features of the case before them and to the technical or complex nature of the Commission's assessments, carry out a comprehensive review as to whether a measure falls within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.", "The Court of First Instance therefore did not err in law so far as concerns the scope of judicial review of the Commission's assessments.", "26 Second, the appellant alleges that, in its review of the present case, the Court of First Instance incorrectly assessed the arguments relied on by the Commission when finding that the measure reducing the public levies was not caught by Article 92(1).", "The appellant maintains that the Court of First Instance wrongly failed to verify whether the criteria adopted by the Commission were justified, as stated in the contested decision, by the nature and scheme of the particular system at issue, whose existence the Court of First Instance indeed acknowledged.", "It accordingly erred in law, decisively affecting the outcome of the case.", "27 The appellant argues that, in the context of regimes applicable to the economy as a whole, consideration of the compatibility of particular measures with Article 92(1) of the Treaty by reason of the nature and scheme of the system of which they form part is essential where the issue is one of distinguishing mechanisms which may constitute State aid from others which are not caught by Article 92(1) precisely because they are justified by the nature and scheme of the system.", "The Court of First Instance could therefore not avoid consideration of whether there was such a justification here before categorising the measure at issue as aid.", "28 As to that, it is clear from paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal that the Court of First Instance not only was aware of the specific nature of the tax regime applicable to horse-race betting in France but also took account of it.", "29 Furthermore, the appellant's reasoning is founded on an incorrect analysis of the contested decision.", "As the Advocate General states in points 25 and 26 of his Opinion, the Commission did not rely, a priori and in vague terms, on the particular nature of the French system of fiscal levies on horse-race betting in order to decide that the reduction in the public levies was not State aid.", "On the contrary, it applied three criteria of interpretation from which it derived the three propositions set out in paragraph 5 of this judgment, in order to reach the conclusion that that reduction amounted not to State aid but to a reform in the form of a \"tax\" adjustment that is justified by the nature and economy of the system in question.", "There is thus no substance to the proposition that the criterion relating to the nature and scheme of the system is independent of the other three criteria or constitutes the legal basis of the Commission's assessment.", "30 It follows that the Court of First Instance neither misconstrued nor refused to take account of the criterion of the nature and scheme of the system when it considered whether, having regard to the facts of the case, the Commission was entitled to find that the measure reducing the public levies did not fall within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.", "31 Third, the French Government alleges that the Court of First Instance erred with regard to the legal characterisation of the facts by implicitly holding that the Commission could not infer from the fact that a specific operation was not financed and from the limited change in the public levies that the reduction in the rate of levy of 1.6% for the benefit of the PMU was consistent with the nature and scheme of the system and did not amount to aid within the meaning of Article 92(1).", "32 It should be noted that in paragraphs 57, 58 and 59 of the judgment under appeal the Court of First Instance queried the validity of those two criteria adopted by the Commission, but it found in any event that the change in the rate of the public levies was designed to finance a specific operation and that the reduction in the rate of levy was not limited in nature.", "33 In those circumstances, it is unnecessary for the Court to establish whether the Court of First Instance was wrong to find that the Commission was not entitled to have recourse to those criteria in order to determine whether the fiscal measure at issue constituted State aid.", "34 In addition, the arguments relied on by the appellant to contest the findings of the Court of First Instance referred to in paragraph 32 of this judgment effectively dispute the Court's assessment of the facts, a matter not open to challenge on appeal.", "Those arguments must therefore be rejected as inadmissible.", "35 The final argument in the first part of the first ground of appeal consists in the assertion that a contradiction is apparent in the grounds of the judgment under appeal.", "The appellant refers in particular to paragraph 154 of the judgment, where the Court of First Instance stated that it is apparent from the contested decision that before the PMI was set up in January 1989 there was no trade between France and the other Member States, which means that before that date there was not even competition between the PMU and the other economic operators active on the Community market in bet-taking.", "36 According to the appellant, on the very wording of Article 92(1) of the Treaty that statement should have led the Court of First Instance to find that no measure implemented for the benefit of the PMU before 1989, nor in particular adjustments to the public levies as from 1985 - at least so far as concerns their effects until the end of 1988 - could constitute State aid caught by that provision.", "37 That proposition cannot be accepted.", "It is apparent from paragraphs 51 to 62 of the judgment under appeal that the Court of First Instance merely determined whether the three criteria referred to in the contested decision concerning the change in the public levies were sufficient to justify the finding that that change amounted to a reform in the form of a tax adjustment that was justified by the nature and scheme of the system in question.", "On the other hand, the Court of First Instance did not rule on the remaining criteria for application of Article 92(1) of the Treaty, in particular on the question whether competition in the Community betting market was affected by that adjustment of the public levies.", "There can thus be no contradiction between the conclusion set out in paragraph 62 of the judgment under appeal and the statements contained in paragraph 154 thereof.", "38 The same considerations hold good for the other State measures examined by the Court of First Instance.", "39 The first part of the first ground of appeal must accordingly be rejected.", "40 In the second part of the first ground of appeal, the French Republic criticises the judgment under appeal in so far as the Court of First Instance held that the Commission had misapplied Article 92(1) of the Treaty when it found that the cash-flow facilities enabling the PMU to defer the payment of certain betting levies did not constitute State aid.", "41 It should be noted at the outset that the appellant repeats in part the objections raised in the first part of this ground of appeal, relating to the scope of judicial review and the alleged failure of the Court of First Instance to take account of the particular nature of the system of levies on horse-race betting in France and the way in which it is organised.", "For the reasons set out in paragraphs 23 to 30 of this judgment, those objections must be rejected.", "42 Next, the appellant criticises the Court of First Instance for finding, in paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal, that the contested decision contains no statement to the effect that the change in the rules concerning payment to the Treasury of the betting levies did not constitute an ad hoc derogation but was a general amendment to the tax regime for the entire horse-racing sector and not only for the PMU.", "43 Finally, the appellant alleges that, contrary to the statement made by the Court of First Instance in paragraph 81 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission did indeed set out in the contested decision evidence showing that the State intervention in question was made in the context of exceptionally heavy taxation of the horse-racing sector, which is significantly higher than in other sectors.", "44 In that regard, suffice it to state, as the Advocate General has done in points 37 and 39 of his Opinion, that those arguments relate to the Court of First Instance's assessment of the facts, which cannot be challenged before the Court of Justice on appeal.", "Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected.", "45 In the third part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant contends that the Court of First Instance erred in law by holding, in paragraph 111 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission's finding that the PMU's access to winnings unclaimed by bettors, while designed to finance social expenditure of the racecourse undertakings, did not constitute State aid because no transfer of State resources was involved was based on false premisses and for that reason had to be annulled.", "46 According to the appellant, the judgment under appeal should be set aside in that respect since, having regard to the nature and scheme of the system in question, the funds retained by the PMU after payment of winnings to bettors and of the public levies constitute normal resources.", "The mere fact that at a given moment the State restricts use of part of those resources to particular objectives cannot transform their nature and convert them into State resources.", "47 In that regard, it is to be noted that in paragraphs 105 to 108 of the judgment under appeal the Court of First Instance explains its assessment concerning the categorisation of the national measure in question as State aid.", "As the Advocate General states in point 42 of his Opinion, that assessment leaves no room for criticism of its legal correctness.", "48 It is clear from those paragraphs of the judgment under appeal that the measure enables the racecourse undertakings to cover certain social expenditure of the PMU and that the amount of the sums corresponding to the unclaimed winnings is monitored by the competent French authorities.", "The Court of First Instance inferred therefrom in paragraph 109 that, inasmuch as national legislation extended the range of uses to which those sums may be put to activities of the racecourse undertakings other than those initially envisaged, the national legislature, by virtue of that extension, in effect waived revenue which in principle should have been paid over to the Treasury.", "49 The Court of First Instance added in paragraph 110 that in so far as those resources had been used to finance social expenditure, in particular, as stated in the contested decision, it was settled case-law that they constituted a reduction in the social security commitments which an undertaking normally had to discharge, and thus constituted aid to it.", "50 The judgment in Case T-358/94 Air France v Commission [1996] ECR II-2109, relied on by the appellant, provides very clear confirmation, at paragraph 67, that Article 92(1) of the Treaty covers all the financial means by which the public sector may actually support undertakings, irrespective of whether or not those means are permanent assets of the public sector.", "Consequently, even though the sums involved in the measure allowing the PMU access to unclaimed winnings are not permanently held by the Treasury, the fact that they constantly remain under public control, and therefore available to the competent national authorities, is sufficient for them to be categorised as State aid and for the measure to fall within Article 92(1) of the Treaty.", "51 The third part of the first ground of appeal must accordingly be rejected.", "52 The fourth part of the first ground of appeal relates to paragraphs 118 to 122 of the judgment under appeal, in which the Court of First Instance held that the Commission erred in fact with regard to the implementation of the exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT inasmuch as it found that the system of the permanent deposit with the French Treasury, offsetting the cash-flow benefits resulting from the altered time of deduction, had existed only since 1989 when it had begun to apply in 1969.", "53 The appellant contends that the Court of First Instance set aside the Commission's assessment regarding the period after 1 January 1989 by relying on matters which essentially relate to the period before that date.", "Furthermore, the Court of First Instance could not rely solely on those matters in order to conclude that the Commission's assessment in respect of the entire period after 1 January 1989 was erroneous.", "In this respect, the judgment of the Court of First Instance is, in its submission, vitiated by defective reasoning and, in any event, by an inadequate statement of grounds.", "54 Those objections cannot be upheld since they are based on an incorrect analysis of the judgment under appeal.", "Contrary to the appellant's assertions, the Court of First Instance did not hold that the exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT constituted State aid as regards the period after 1 January 1989 but merely found that, given the manifest errors of fact on which the whole of the Commission's line of argument was founded, it was impossible for it to rule as to whether or not State aid was involved.", "Such an assessment of the substance falls outside the scope of the appellate review which the Court of Justice may carry out.", "Accordingly, the final part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected as inadmissible.", "Second ground of appeal", "55 In its second ground of appeal, the French Republic contends that the judgment under appeal is vitiated by an error of law inasmuch as the Court of First Instance held in paragraph 185 that the contested decision infringed Article 93(2) of the Treaty by limiting the temporal scope of the French authorities' obligation to require repayment of the aid derived from the PMU's exemption from the housing levy to the period after 11 January 1991, the date on which the procedure against the French Republic was opened, when reimbursement of the State aid should have been required from the date from which it was declared incompatible with the common market, that is to say from 1989.", "56 It should be recalled that the Commission found in the contested decision that the PMU's exemption from the housing levy was incompatible with the Treaty from 1989; however, it considered that the PMU had to repay the corresponding sums only from the date on which the procedure was opened in January 1991, because until that time the PMU entertained legitimate expectations as to the legality of the exemption by reason of a judgment of the French Conseil d'État according to which operations of the racecourse undertakings were agricultural and therefore qualified for exemption from the housing levy.", "57 The Court of First Instance stated in paragraph 184 of the judgment under appeal that the Commission could not itself take into account the recipient's legitimate expectations, as invoked by the Member State, in order to set aside the requirement that aid considered by it to be incompatible with the common market should be repaid.", "58 According to the appellant, the judgment under appeal is vitiated by an error of law.", "More specifically, it complains that the Court of First Instance has denied the Commission the possibility of examining a Member State's argument that a recipient of aid entertained a legitimate expectation as to its legality.", "It adds that the position adopted by the Court of First Instance makes the procedure excessively cumbersome, since it does not allow a fundamental argument directly affecting the question of recovery of the aid to be considered at the stage of the Commission's review.", "59 It is unnecessary to examine whether the Court of First Instance was right in stating, at paragraph 183 of the judgment under appeal, that it is not for the State concerned, but for the recipient undertaking, in the context of proceedings before the public authorities or before the national courts, to plead exceptional circumstances on the basis of which it had entertained legitimate expectations, justifying refusal to repay unlawful aid.", "It need merely be stated that, as Ladbroke correctly submitted before the Court of First Instance, the reasoning in the contested decision was in any event inadequate so far as concerns waiver of the requirement to repay part of the aid declared incompatible with the common market.", "60 In the contested decision, the Commission merely referred to the existence of the judgment of the Conseil d'État, without in any way indicating why, in its opinion, it amounted to an exceptional circumstance liable to give rise to legitimate expectations on the part of the recipient of the aid notwithstanding the failure to comply with the rules laid down in Article 93 of the Treaty.", "61 The Court of First Instance was accordingly right to conclude that the contested decision had to be annulled in so far as it required repayment of the aid deriving from the PMU's exemption from the housing levy only from the opening of the procedure, that is to say from 11 January 1991.", "62 The second ground of appeal must therefore be rejected .", "63 Accordingly, neither ground of appeal relied on by the appellant is well founded and the appeal must be dismissed.", "Decision on costs", "Costs", "64 Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, which applies to the appeal procedure by virtue of Article 118, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party's pleadings.", "Since the Commission has requested that the French Republic be ordered to pay the costs and the French Republic has been unsuccessful, it must be

appeal, 3F (‘the appellant’), formerly Specialarbejderforbundet i Danmark (SID), the general trade union for workers in Denmark, asks the Court to set aside the order of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities of 23 April 2007 in Case T‑30/03 SID v Commission (‘the order under appeal’) dismissing its application for annulment of Commission Decision C(2002) 4370 final of 13 November 2002 not to raise objections to the Danish fiscal measures applicable to seafarers employed on board vessels registered in the Danish International Register (‘the contested decision’).", "Legal context", "2 Article 4(3) and (4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [88] of the EC Treaty (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1) reads as follows:", "‘3.", "Where the Commission, after a preliminary examination, finds that no doubts are raised as to the compatibility with the common market of a notified measure, in so far as it falls within the scope of Article [87(1)] of the [EC] Treaty, it shall decide that the measure is compatible with the common market (hereinafter referred to as a “decision not to raise objections”).", "The decision shall specify which exception under the Treaty has been applied.", "4.", "Where the Commission, after a preliminary examination, finds that doubts are raised as to the compatibility with the common market of a notified measure, it shall decide to initiate proceedings pursuant to Article [88(2)] of the Treaty (hereinafter referred to as a “decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure”).’", "3 The Community guidelines on State aid to maritime transport (OJ 1997 C 205, p. 5, ‘the Community guidelines’) aim, in accordance with point 2.2 of the guidelines, entitled ‘General objectives of revised State aid guidelines’, to increase transparency and to clarify what State aid schemes may be introduced in order to support the Community maritime interest.", "Point 2.2 states:", "‘… This policy should:", "– safeguard EC employment, …", "– preserve maritime know-how in the Community and develop maritime skills, and", "– improve safety.", "…’", "4 Point 3.2 of the Community guidelines, ‘Labour-related costs’, reads as follows:", "‘…", "Support measures for the maritime sector should … aim primarily at reducing fiscal and other costs and burdens borne by EC shipowners and EC seafarers (i.e. those liable to taxation and/or social security contributions in a Member State) towards levels in line with world norms.", "They should directly stimulate the development of the sector and employment, rather than provide general financial assistance.", "In line with the objective, therefore, the following action on employment costs should be allowed for EC shipping:", "– …", "– reduced rates of income tax for EC seafarers on board ships registered in a Member State.", "…’", "Facts of the dispute", "5 On 1 July 1988 the Kingdom of Denmark adopted Law No 408, which entered into force on 23 August 1988, establishing a Danish International Register of Shipping (‘the DIS register’).", "That register was in addition to the ordinary Danish register of ships (‘the DAS register’).", "The DIS register is intended to combat the flight from Community flags to flags of convenience.", "The main advantage of the DIS register is that shipowners whose vessels are registered in it are allowed to employ seafarers from non-member countries on those vessels and pay them wages on the basis of their national laws.", "6 On the same date the Kingdom of Denmark adopted Laws Nos 361, 362, 363 and 364, which entered into force on 1 January 1989, introducing various fiscal measures relating to seafarers employed on board vessels registered in the DIS register (‘the fiscal measures at issue’).", "In particular, those seafarers were exempted from income tax, whereas seafarers employed on board vessels registered in the DAS register were subject to that tax.", "7 On 28 August 1998 the appellant lodged a complaint with the Commission against the Kingdom of Denmark concerning the fiscal measures at issue, arguing that they were contrary to the Community guidelines and hence to Article 87 EC.", "8 In its complaint the appellant submitted that the fiscal measures at issue constituted State aid which was incompatible with the Community guidelines because the tax exemption was granted to all seafarers, not only Community seafarers, and because the measures had not been notified to the Commission.", "9 On 13 November 2002 the Commission adopted the contested decision, in which it decided not to raise any objections ‘to the fiscal measures that have been applied since 1 January 1989 to seafarers on board vessels registered in Denmark in either the DAS or the DIS register, considering that the arrangements constitute State aid but that they were or still are compatible with the common market in accordance with Article 87(3)(c) EC’ (second indent of point 46 of the decision).", "Procedure before the Court of First Instance", "10 By application lodged at the Registry of the Court of First Instance on 30 January 2003, the appellant sought the annulment of the contested decision and an order that the Commission pay the costs.", "11 By separate document lodged at the Registry of the Court of First Instance on 17 March 2003, the Commission raised a plea of inadmissibility under Article 114 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of First Instance, asking that Court to dismiss the application before it as manifestly inadmissible and to order the appellant to pay the costs.", "12 It its observations on the plea of inadmissibility, submitted on 16 May 2003, the appellant contended that the Court of First Instance should reject that plea and order the Commission to pay the costs relating to the plea.", "13 By order of 18 June 2003, the President of the Second Chamber (Extended Composition) of the Court of First Instance, after hearing the parties, gave leave to the Kingdom of Denmark and the Kingdom of Norway to intervene in support of the Commission.", "The interveners waived submission of a statement in intervention limited to the question of admissibility.", "The order under appeal", "14 In support of its application for annulment of the contested decision, the appellant raised three pleas in law: first, infringement of Article 88(2) EC and the principle of sound administration, in that the Commission had not initiated the review procedure laid down by that provision; second, infringement of Article 87(3) EC, interpreted in the light of the Community guidelines and the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations; and third, manifest error of assessment.", "15 In paragraph 24 of the order under appeal, the Court of First Instance noted that where, without initiating the formal review procedure under Article 88(2) EC, the Commission finds, by a decision taken on the basis of Article 88(3) EC, that aid is compatible with the common market, the Community judicature declares admissible an action for the annulment of such a decision brought by a person who is concerned within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC where that person seeks, by instituting proceedings, to safeguard the procedural rights available to him under that provision.", "16 In paragraph 25 of the order under appeal, the Court of First Instance stated that the parties concerned within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC who are thus entitled under the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC to institute proceedings for annulment are those persons, undertakings or associations whose interests might be affected by the grant of aid, in particular undertakings competing with the recipients of the aid and trade associations (Case 323/82 Intermills v Commission [1984] ECR 3809, paragraph 16, and Case C‑78/03 P Commission v Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum [2005] ECR I‑10737, paragraph 36).", "17 In paragraph 26 of the order under appeal, the Court of First Instance observed that if, on the other hand, the applicant calls in question the merits of the decision appraising the aid as such, he must then demonstrate that he has a particular status as defined in the line of case-law following from Case 25/62 Plaumann v Commission [1963] ECR 95.", "That is so in particular where the applicant’s position in the market is substantially affected by the aid to which the decision at issue relates.", "18 In paragraph 28 of the order under appeal, the Court of First Instance held:", "‘Where an applicant seeks – as the [appellant] does by its first plea – to safeguard the procedural rights available to him under Article 88(2) EC in order to obtain the annulment of a decision not to raise objections, the Community judicature will declare his action admissible if he is a party concerned within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC (Commission v [Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum], paragraphs 35 and 36).’", "19 In paragraphs 30 to 33 of the order under appeal, the Court of First Instance stated as follows:", "‘30 … it has been held that an action for annulment brought under Article 230 EC against a decision on State aid adopted without initiating the formal review procedure is inadmissible if the applicant’s competitive position in the market is not affected by the grant of the aid (Case T‑188/95 Waterleiding Maatschappij v Commission [1998] ECR II‑3713, paragraph 62; see also, to that effect, Case T‑69/96 Hamburger Hafen- und Lagerhaus and Others v Commission [2001] ECR II‑1037, paragraph 41).", "Similarly, it has been held that an applicant who is not an undertaking whose competitive position has allegedly been affected by the State measures said to be aid cannot establish a personal interest in relying on the alleged anti-competitive effects of those measures in an action against the Commission’s decision not to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 88(2) EC (see, to that effect, Case T‑178/94 ATM v Commission [1997] ECR II‑2529, paragraph 63, and the order in [Case T‑41/01 Pérez Escolar v Commission [2003] ECR II‑2157], paragraph 46).", "31 Neither the [appellant] as a seafarers’ trade union nor its members are competitors of the recipients of the aid at issue as identified in the contested decision, namely the owners of ships registered in the DIS register.", "32 Thus, as regards the [appellant] itself, it cannot claim that its own competitive position is affected by the aid at issue.", "First, it has been held that an association of the employees of the undertaking which allegedly benefited from State aid was in no way in competition with that undertaking (ATM v Commission, … paragraph 63).", "Second, in so far as the [appellant] relies on its own competitive position in relation to other seafarers’ trade unions in the negotiation of collective agreements in the sector in question, it suffices to point out that agreements concluded in the context of collective negotiations do not fall within the scope of competition law (see, for the non-application of Articles 3(g) EC and 81 EC to collective agreements, Case C‑67/96 Albany [1999] ECR I‑5751, paragraphs 52 to 60).", "33 Similarly, as regards the [appellant’s] members, there is nothing in the case-file to indicate that those seafarers fall outside the definition of a worker within the meaning of Article 39 EC, namely a person who for a certain period of time performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for which he receives remuneration.", "As workers, they are not therefore themselves undertakings (Case C‑22/98 Becu and Others [1999] ECR I‑5665, paragraph 26).’", "20 Further, in paragraph 35 of the order under appeal, the Court of First Instance recalled that it was not excluded that bodies representing the employees of the undertaking in receipt of aid might, as parties concerned within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC, submit comments to the Commission on considerations of a social nature which could be taken into account by the Commission if appropriate, citing in this respect the order in Case T‑189/97 Comité d’entreprise de la Société française de production and Others v Commission [1998] ECR II‑335, paragraph 41.", "However, in paragraph 36 of the order under appeal, it observed that the social aspects of the DIS register derived primarily from the establishment of the register by Law No 408 rather than from the accompanying fiscal measures, and that the Commission had taken the view that the establishment of the DIS register did not constitute State aid, limiting its examination of the compatibility with the common market of the State measures solely to the fiscal measures at issue.", "The Court of First Instance concluded, also in paragraph 36, that the social aspects of the DIS register were only indirectly linked to the subject-matter of the contested decision and that the appellant could not therefore rely on those social aspects to establish that it was individually concerned.", "21 The Court of First Instance also rejected, in paragraph 37 of the order under appeal, the appellant’s argument that it could be regarded as individually concerned merely because the aid in question was passed on to the recipients by means of a reduction in the wage claims of the seafarers benefiting from the income tax exemption established by the fiscal measures.", "It found that the contested decision was based on the advantages received by the recipients of the aid, not on the method of transmission of the aid.", "22 Finally, the Court of First Instance held that the appellant had not shown that its own interests as a negotiator were liable to be directly affected by the aid deriving from the fiscal measures at issue.", "Referring to Joined Cases 67/85, 68/85 and 70/85 Van der Kooy and Others v Commission [1988] ECR 219 and Case C‑313/90 CIRFS and Others v Commission [1993] ECR I‑1125, it found, in paragraphs 39 and 40 of the order under appeal, that the mere fact that the appellant had made a complaint to the Commission against the aid at issue did not mean that it was distinguished individually.", "Even though the appellant might have been one of the negotiators of the collective agreements for seafarers on board ships registered in one of the Danish registers and as such have played a part in the machinery for passing the aid on to shipowners, the appellant had not shown that it had negotiated the drafting of the Community guidelines on State aid to maritime transport, relied on in the present case, with the Commission or the adoption of the fiscal measures at issue with the Commission or the Danish Government.", "23 The Court of First Instance concluded, in paragraphs 41 and 42 of the order under appeal, that neither the appellant nor its members were individually concerned by the contested decision, so that the application brought by the appellant was inadmissible for want of a legal interest in bringing proceedings as defined in Article 230 EC.", "The appeal", "24 By its appeal, the appellant claims that the Court should:", "– set aside the order under appeal in its entirety;", "– declare the application to the Court of First Instance admissible; and", "– order the Commission to pay the costs of the appeal.", "25 The Commission contends that the appeal should be dismissed and the appellant ordered to pay the costs.", "26 The appellant puts forward four grounds of appeal.", "The first is thatthe Court of First Instance applied the Albany judgment too broadly in concluding that the appellant’s competitive position was not affected by the aid resulting from the fiscal measures at issue.", "The second is that the Court of First Instance erred in law by finding that the appellant could not rely on the social aspects of the Community guidelines to establish that it was individually concerned by the contested decision.", "The third is that the Plaumann and Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum judgments were misapplied in that the Court of First Instance found that the appellant could not be regarded as individually concerned merely because the aid resulting from the fiscal measures at issue was passed on to the recipients by means of a reduction in the wage claims of the seafarers benefiting from the income tax exemption.", "The fourth is that the Court of First Instance misapplied the Van der Kooy and Others and CIRFS and Others line of case-law by concluding that the appellant’s own interests as a negotiator were not affected by the fiscal measures at issue.", "Preliminary observations", "27 Before the grounds of appeal are examined, it is appropriate to recall the relevant rules concerning the standing to bring proceedings, against a Commission decision on State aid, of a party other than the Member State to which that decision is addressed.", "28 Under the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC, a natural or legal person may institute proceedings against a decision addressed to another person only if that decision is of direct and individual concern to the former.", "29 It is settled case-law that persons other than those to whom a decision is addressed may claim to be individually concerned only if that decision affects them by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons and by virtue of those factors distinguishes them individually just as in the case of the person addressed by such a decision (see, inter alia, Plaumann, at p. 107; Case C‑198/91 Cook v Commission [1993] ECR I‑2487, paragraph 20; Case C‑225/91 Matra v Commission [1993] ECR I‑3203, paragraph 14; Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum, paragraph 33; and Case C‑487/06 P British Aggregates v Commission [2008] ECR I‑0000, paragraph 26).", "30 As the action at first instance concerned a Commission decision on State aid, it must be borne in mind that, in the context of the procedure for reviewing State aid provided for in Article 88 EC, the preliminary stage of the procedure for reviewing aid under Article 88(3) EC, which is intended merely to allow the Commission to form a prima facie opinion on the partial or complete conformity of the aid in question, must be distinguished from the stage of the review under Article 88(2) EC.", "It is only at the latter stage, which is designed to enable the Commission to be fully informed of all the facts of the case, that the Treaty imposes an obligation on the Commission to give the parties concerned notice to submit their comments (see Cook, paragraph 22; Matra, paragraph 16; Case C‑367/95 P Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France [1998] ECR I‑1719, paragraph 38; Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum, paragraph 34; and British Aggregates, paragraph 27).", "31 It follows that, where, without initiating the formal review procedure under Article 88(2) EC, the Commission finds, on the basis of Article 88(3) EC, that aid is compatible with the common market, the persons intended to benefit from those procedural guarantees may secure compliance therewith only if they are able to challenge that decision before the Community judicature.", "For those reasons, an action for the annulment of such a decision brought by a person who is concerned within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC is declared to be admissible where that person seeks, by instituting proceedings, to safeguard the procedural rights available to him under the latter provision (Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited, and British Aggregates, paragraph 28).", "32 The Court has had occasion to observe that such parties concerned are any persons, undertakings or associations whose interests might be affected by the granting of aid, that is, in particular, undertakings competing with the recipients of the aid and trade associations (Sytraval and Brink’s France, paragraph 41; Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum, paragraph 36; and British Aggregates, paragraph 29).", "33 It is not excluded that a trade union may be regarded as ‘concerned’ within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC if it shows that its interests or those of its members might be affected by the granting of aid.", "The trade union must, however, show to the requisite legal standard that the aid is likely to have a real effect on its situation or that of the seafarers it represents.", "34 The Court has also held that if, on the other hand, the applicant calls into question the merits of the decision appraising the aid as such, the mere fact that he may be regarded as ‘concerned’ within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC cannot suffice for the action to be considered admissible.", "He must then demonstrate that he enjoys a particular status within the meaning of the Plaumann judgment.", "That is the case in particular where the applicant’s market position is substantially affected by the aid which is the subject of the decision at issue (Case 169/84 Cofaz and Others v Commission [1986] ECR 391, paragraphs 22 to 25; Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum, paragraph 37; Joined Cases C‑75/05 P and C‑80/05 P Germany and Others v Kronofrance [2008] ECR I‑0000, paragraph 40; and British Aggregates, paragraph 35).", "35 It is true that, as appears from Article 4(3) of Regulation No 659/1999, a decision of the Commission not to raise objections is taken where the Commission finds that the notified measure does not raise doubts as to its compatibility with the common market.", "If an applicant seeks the annulment of such a decision, he is essentially challenging the fact that the decision on the aid was adopted without the Commission initiating the formal review procedure, thereby infringing his procedural rights.", "For his action to be successful, the applicant may attempt to show that the compatibility of the measure in question should have given rise to doubts.", "The use of such arguments cannot, however, have the consequence of changing the subject-matter of the application or altering the conditions of its admissibility.", "36 It is clear that, in the present case, as is apparent both from the order under appeal and from the case-file at first instance, the appellant’s first plea in law in its application was aimed at safeguarding its procedural rights under Article 88(2) EC, by challenging the failure, in the circumstances of the case, to initiate the formal review procedure provided for by that provision, as was expressly acknowledged by the Court of First Instance in paragraph 28 of that order.", "37 It is also apparent from paragraph 8 of the order under appeal that the President of the Second Chamber, Extended Composition, of the Court of First Instance, after hearing the parties, stayed the proceedings on the application before the Court of First Instance by order of 16 February 2005 pending the decision of the Court of Justice in the Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum case, noting that the application was directed against a decision of the Commission taken without initiating the formal review procedure provided for in Article 88(2) EC.", "38 Moreover, after judgment was given in Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum, the Court of First Instance, by letter of 24 January 2006, invited the parties to submit observations on that judgment, in particular on the application to the case of the decision in Cook, which the Court had referred to in paragraphs 35 and 36 of Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum, in relation to the question of admissibility and the appellant’s status as a party concerned within the meaning of that paragraph 36.", "39 It follows that, as regards the first plea in law relied on by the appellant before the Court of First Instance, concerning the failure to initiate the formal review procedure, that Court sought to determine, as was expressly stated in paragraph 28 of the order under appeal, whether the appellant could be regarded as a party concerned within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC.", "40 It is therefore in the light of those considerations that the four grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant should be examined.", "The first ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "41 The appellant argues that, by referring to Albany to conclude that the appellant could not rely on its own competitive position in relation to other seafarers’ trade unions in the negotiation of collective agreements, the Court of First Instance interpreted that judgment too broadly.", "The Court said nothing to that effect in that judgment, which concerned Article 85 of the EC Treaty (now Article 81 EC) as applied to public undertakings by virtue of Article 90 of the EC Treaty (now Article 86 EC), about any relationship there might be between collective agreements and the application of the rules on State aid in Article 92 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 87 EC) and Article 93 of the EC Treaty (now Article 88 EC).", "42 The Commission submits that the first ground of appeal should be rejected as inoperative, or alternatively as unfounded.", "It argues that the case-law cited by the Court of First Instance in the first part of paragraph 32 of the order under appeal, namely the ATM judgment, was a sufficient basis for its conclusion that this part of the appellant’s application relating to its competitive position was inadmissible.", "In those circumstances, it submits that the appellant’s argument as to the irrelevance of the Albany judgment is inoperative and there is no need for the Court to examine the merits of this ground of appeal.", "43 In any event, with reference to the second part of paragraph 32 of the order under appeal, the Commission submits that Albany and all the judgments confirming it show that the negotiation of collective agreements is not covered by the competition rules of the Treaty, including the rules on State aid.", "Collective labour agreements are not ‘goods’ within the meaning of Article 81 EC or of Article 87 EC.", "Trade unions, when negotiating such agreements, are therefore also not ‘undertakings’ producing ‘goods’ within the meaning of those provisions.", "Findings of the Court", "44 To determine whether the appellant should be regarded as concerned within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC and its application therefore declared admissible, the Court of First Instance began by considering whether the appellant’s competitive position in the market was affected by the granting of aid.", "45 The Commission’s argument that the judgment in ATM was sufficient ground in itself for rejecting the appellant’s arguments relating to its competitive position cannot be accepted.", "The first part of paragraph 32 of the order under appeal concerns the alleged competitive position of the appellant in relation to its members’ employers, namely the shipowners who benefit from the aid resulting from the fiscal measures at issue, not its alleged competitive position in relation to other trade unions in the negotiation of collective agreements, which is a separate argument referred to in the second part of paragraph 32.", "46 Even if the appellant had argued that it was in a competitive position in relation to the shipowners – which it denied at the hearing – it was still open to it, despite the ATM judgment, to attempt to show that it had standing to bring proceedings because its interests might be affected by the granting of aid, by reason of the effect of the measures on its competitive position in relation to other trade unions whose members are employed on board vessels registered in the DIS register.", "47 As to the Court of First Instance’s interpretation of Albany in paragraph 32 of the order under appeal, it must be observed that the Albany case concerned a collective agreement establishing a supplementary pension scheme managed by a pension fund in the textile industry sector, affiliation to which could be made compulsory by the public authorities.", "Albany International BV, an undertaking in the textile sector, had refused to pay the fund the contributions for a certain period, on the ground that compulsory affiliation to the fund, by virtue of which those contributions were claimed from it, was inter alia contrary to Article 85(1) of the Treaty.", "48 Before concluding that Article 85(1) of the Treaty did not apply in those circumstances, the Court pointed out, in paragraph 54 of Albany, that, under Article 3(g) and (i) of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 3(1)(g) and (j) EC), the activities of the Community are to include not only a ‘system ensuring that competition in the internal market is not distorted’ but also ‘a policy in the social sphere’.", "Article 2 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 2 EC) declares that a particular task of the Community is ‘to promote … a harmonious and balanced development of economic activities’ and ‘a high level of employment and of social protection’.", "49 Moreover, it is apparent from the first paragraph of Article 136 EC that the Community and the Member States have as their objectives inter alia the promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions, so as to make possible their harmonisation while the improvement is being maintained, proper social protection, and dialogue between management and labour.", "Under Article 138(1) EC the Commission has the task of promoting the consultation of management and labour at Community level, and that dialogue may, should they so desire, lead to contractual relations.", "The Commission also takes any relevant measure to facilitate their dialogue by ensuring balanced support for the parties (see, to that effect, Albany, paragraphs 55 to 58, with respect to the EEC Treaty and the Agreement on social policy concluded between the Member States of the European Community with the exception of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (OJ 1992 C 191, p. 91) before the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam).", "50 The Court accepted in Albany that some restrictions of competition are inherent in collective agreements between organisations representing employers and workers.", "However, the social policy objectives pursued by such agreements would be seriously undermined if management and labour were subject to Article 85(1) of the Treaty when seeking jointly to adopt measures to improve conditions of work and employment.", "In those circumstances, the Court found that agreements concluded in the context of collective negotiations between management and labour in pursuit of such objectives must, by virtue of their nature and purpose, be regarded as falling outside the scope of that provision.", "The Court then considered whether the nature and purpose of the agreement at issue in Albany justified its exclusion from the scope of Article 85(1) of the Treaty, and concluded that, in that case, its exclusion from the scope of that provision was justified (see Albany, paragraphs 59 to 64).", "51  It thus follows from Albany, and from the later judgments which confirmed Albany, that it is for the competent authorities and courts to consider, in each individual case, whether the nature and purpose of the agreement in question and the social policy objectives pursued by it warrant its exclusion from the scope of Article 81(1) EC (see, to that effect, inter alia, Case C‑222/98 Van der Woude [2000] ECR I‑7111, paragraph 23).", "52 In the present case, as may be seen from paragraph 34 of the order under appeal, the appellant as an organisation representing workers is by definition established to promote the collective interests of its members.", "According to the observations it submitted to the Court of First Instance, as set out in paragraphs 17 to 20 of the order under appeal, it is an economic operator which negotiates the terms and conditions on which labour is provided to undertakings.", "It says that the aid resulting from the fiscal measures at issue affects the ability of its members to compete with non-Community seafarers in seeking employment with shipping companies, in other words the recipients of the aid, and the appellant’s market position as such is therefore affected as regards its ability to compete in the market for the supply of labour to those companies, and consequently its ability to recruit members.", "53It should also be noted that the appellant opposed the Danish legislation relating to the DIS register, in particular the fiscal measures at issue, on the ground that the DIS register allowed shipowners whose vessels were registered in it to employ seafarers who were nationals of non-member countries, paying them wages on the basis of their national law, and that those fiscal measures, which were the subject of the contested decision, made it possible to exempt from income tax all seafarers employed on board vessels registered in the DIS register without distinguishing between seafarers from Member States and those from non-member countries.", "54 It follows that, unlike the Albany case, the present case concerns not the competition-restricting nature of the collective agreements concluded between the appellant or other trade unions and the shipowners who benefit from the aid resulting from the fiscal measures at issue but the question of whether the appellant’s competitive position in relation to those other trade unions was affected by the granting of that aid, so that it should be regarded as a party concerned within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC, in which case its action for annulment of the contested decision would be admissible.", "55 It cannot be deduced from the fact that an agreement could be excluded, by reason of its nature and purpose and the social policy objectives pursed by it, from the scope of the provisions of Article 81(1) EC that collective negotiations or the parties involved in them are likewise, entirely and automatically, excluded from the Treaty rules on State aid, or that an action for annulment which might be brought by those parties would, almost automatically, be regarded as inadmissible because of their involvement in those negotiations.", "56 It is difficult to see how the social policy objectives pursed by collective agreements could be seriously undermined – such a risk being the reason for the exclusion of those agreements from the scope of Article 85(1) of the Treaty in Albany – by acknowledging that, when it negotiates the terms and conditions of work of its members, a trade union such as the appellant could be in a competitive situation in relation to other trade unions whose members benefit from different wage conditions because of the establishment of a register such as the DIS register.", "57 On the contrary, to exclude a priori the possibility, in a case such as the present, that a trade union could show that it is a party concerned within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC, by relying on its role in collective negotiations and the effects on that role of national tax measures regarded by the Commission as aid compatible with the common market, would be liable to undermine the very social policy objectives which induced the Court to exclude the collective agreement at issue in Albany from the application of Article 85(1) of the Treaty.", "58 That conclusion is supported by the fact that, since the Community has not only an economic but also a social purpose, the rights under the provisions of the Treaty on State aid and competition must be balanced, where appropriate, against the objectives pursued by social policy, which include, as is clear from the first paragraph of Article 136 EC, inter alia improved living and working conditions, so as to make possible their harmonisation while improvement is being maintained, proper social protection and dialogue between management and labour (see, to that effect, with respect to the Treaty provisions on freedom of establishment, Case C‑438/05 International Transport Workers’ Federation and Finnish Seamen’s Union [2007] ECR I‑10779, paragraph 79).", "59 Admittedly, as stated in paragraph 33 above, the applicant must always show to the requisite legal standard that his interests might be affected by the granting of the aid, which it is possible for him to do by showing that he is in fact in a competitive position in relation to other trade unions operating in the same market.", "However, that possibility cannot be excluded a priori by reference to the Albany line of case-law or to an excessively restrictive interpretation of the concept of ‘market’ in connection with the question of the status of party concerned within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC of an organisation such as a trade union seeking to argue that its action for annulment is admissible.", "60 Since the Court of First Instance interpreted Albany wrongly, and consequently failed to address the appellant’s argument relating to its competitive position in relation to other trade unions in the negotiation of collective agreements for seafarers, the order under appeal must accordingly be set aside on this point.", "The second ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "61 The appellant submits, as regards paragraphs 35 and 36 of the order under appeal, that the Court of First Instance, after referring to the order in Case T‑189/97 Comité d’entreprise de la Société française de production and Others, did not examine the social aspects implicit in the legal conditions for authorisation of tax reductions for Community seafarers, namely the Community guidelines, and concluded that the appellant could not rely on the principle stated in that order.", "62 According to the appellant, the Community guidelines draw an implicit distinction between ‘Community seafarers’ and other seafarers.", "That distinction recognises that there was a social ‘quid pro quo’ to be met in return for allowing State aid to maritime transport companies.", "The tax exemption for the remuneration of seafarers was justified by the need to compensate for the higher costs of employing Community seafarers compared with seafarers from non-member countries.", "In this way, the objective of safeguarding Community employment, which was one of the objectives of the Community guidelines, could be achieved.", "The social aspects of those guidelines go to the very circumstances in which aid can or cannot be approved.", "As a representative of Danish seafarers, the appellant could have submitted comments on the social aspects of the aid resulting from the fiscal measures at issue if the Commission had initiated the procedure in accordance with Article 88(2) EC.", "63 inoperative, like the first ground, it is in any event unfounded.", "The Court of First Instance was quite right to consider that the social aspects were only indirectly linked to the subject-matter of the contested decision.", "The Commission submits, first, that, as the Court of First Instance rightly found, the DIS register does not grant State aid.", "Second, the appellant, which is appealing against an order of inadmissibility, is seeking by this ground to argue the substance of the case by making allegations about the scope of the Community guidelines.", "The aim of those guidelines is simply irrelevant in determining the admissibility of the action.", "Findings of the Court", "64 It should be noted, to begin with, that, when assessing the compatibility of State aid in the maritime transport sector such as the aid at issue in the present case, the social aspects of the Community guidelines may be taken into account by the Commission as part of an overall assessment which includes a large number of considerations of various kinds, linked in particular to the protection of competition, the Community’s maritime policy, the promotion of Community maritime transport, or the promotion of employment (see, to that effect, Case C‑106/98 P Comité d’entreprise de la Société française de production and Others v Commission [2000] ECR I‑3659, paragraph 52).", "65 Moreover, as stated in paragraph 33 above, it is not excluded that a trade union may be regarded as ‘concerned’ within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC if it shows that its interests or those of its members might be affected by the granting of aid.", "66 In paragraph 36 of the order under appeal, the Court of First Instance held that the social aspects of the DIS register were only indirectly linked to the subject-matter of the contested decision and the appellant’s action for annulment.", "It therefore concluded that the appellant could not rely on those social aspects to establish that it was individually concerned.", "67 It is not disputed that the DIS register does not itself constitute State aid.", "As may be seen from Joined Cases C‑72/91 and C‑73/91 Sloman Neptun [1993] ECR I‑887, a system such as that established by the DIS register, which enables contracts of employment concluded with seafarers who are nationals of non-member countries and have no permanent abode or residence in the Member State concerned to be subjected to working conditions and rates of pay which are not covered by the law of that Member State and are considerably less favourable than those applicable to seafarers who are nationals of that Member State, does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC.", "68 That is why the action for annulment brought by the appellant was directed not against the DIS register but against the fiscal measures at issue, which apply to seafarers employed on board vessels in that register.", "69 Instead of examining, as it did in paragraph 36 of the order under appeal, whether there was a sufficiently direct link between the social aspects of the DIS register and the subject-matter of the contested decision, the Court of First Instance should have examined the social aspects of the fiscal measures at issue with regard to the Community guidelines – which contain the legal conditions for assessing the compatibility of the Danish tax system, as the appellant submitted – in order to assess whether the appellant’s arguments based on those guidelines sufficed to establish its status of a party concerned within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC.", "70 Since it cannot be ruled out that organisations representing the workers of the undertakings benefiting from aid may, as parties concerned within the meaning of that provision of the Treaty, submit observations to the Commission on considerations of a social nature which it can take into account if appropriate, the circumstance that the Court of First Instance did not in fact address the appellant’s argument relating to the social aspects of the fiscal measures at issue with regard to the Community guidelines means that the order under appeal must be set aside on this point.", "The third ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "71 By its third ground of appeal, the appellant submits that the Court of First Instance erred in law, in paragraph 37 of the order under appeal, by dismissing as irrelevant the manner in which the aid resulting from the fiscal measures at issue is passed on, namely that it is transmitted to shipowners via the members of the appellant.", "72 The appellant argues that in Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum the Court held that an association set up to promote the collective interests of a category of persons can be regarded as individually concerned in the Plaumann sense only in so far as the position of the association’s members in the market is substantially affected by the aid scheme which is the subject of the decision in question.", "It submits that the Court analysed the expression ‘position on the market’ from the point of view of ‘economic operators’.", "In the appellant’s view, there is no reason in principle why workers should not also be regarded as economic operators if national legislation or the Community guidelines accord them special consideration in determining the conditions in which aid may be held to be compatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 87(3)(c) EC.", "73 The Commission submits, first, that the judgment in Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum, which was given in a case concerning direct aid granted to farmers, has nothing to do with the finding of the Court of First Instance, in paragraph 37 of the order under appeal, that the contested decision is based on the benefits received by the recipients of the aid, namely the shipowners, not on the manner in which the aid is passed on.", "Next, that judgment is not relevant to the present case, since it concerned a State aid decision adopted by the Commission after opening the procedure under Article 88(2) EC.", "Finally, even if that judgment were relevant in the present case, the Commission observes that that does not mean that workers are individually concerned by a Commission decision authorising aid.", "Paragraph 72 of the judgment was expressly based on the proposition that ‘certain of [the] members [of Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum] are economic operators who may be regarded as direct competitors of beneficiaries of the aid’.", "By contrast, the members of the appellant are seafarers who cannot be regarded as direct competitors of the shipowners and are not ‘economic operators’ within the meaning of that judgment.", "74 In those circumstances, the Commission submits that the third ground of appeal should be considered unfounded.", "Findings of the Court", "75 In paragraph 37 of the order under appeal, the Court of First Instance found that the appellant could not be regarded as individually concerned merely because the aid in question was passed on to its recipients by means of a reduction in the wage claims of the seafarers enjoying the exemption from income tax introduced by the fiscal measures at issue.", "According to the Court of First Instance, the contested decision was based on the advantages received by the recipients of the aid, not on the method of transmission of the aid.", "76 In contrast to the appellant’s action for annulment before the Court of First Instance, complaining that the Commission failed to initiate the formal review procedure provided for in Article 88(2) EC and ultimately aiming at safeguarding the procedural rights conferred by that provision, the application for annulment in Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum concerned a Commission decision terminating such a procedure.", "77It follows that the Court was seeking in that case to determine whether the market position of the members of Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum, an association set up to promote the collective interests of a class of persons, was substantially affected by the aid scheme which was the subject of the decision in question.", "78 In the present case, as is apparent from paragraph 28 of the order under appeal, the appellant had to establish before the Court of First Instance that it was a party concerned within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC, and the application of the Plaumann line of case-law, as in Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum, was prima facie not relevant.", "79 Even if the Court of First Instance ought to have considered the manner in which the aid resulting from the fiscal measures at issue was passed on and the part played in this respect by the shipowners’ employees who were members of the appellant, it should be recalled that in paragraphs 31 to 33 of the order under appeal the Court of First Instance had already found that neither the appellant as a trade union of seafarers nor its members as workers employed by the recipients of the aid were competitors of those recipients.", "As regards in particular the members of the trade union, the Court of First Instance found that, since they appeared to be persons falling within the definition of a worker within the meaning of Article 39 EC, they were not themselves undertakings.", "80 Apart from the incorrect application of Albany in the present case in the second part of paragraph 32 of the order under appeal – the target of the first ground of appeal – the appellant has not contested the conclusions of the Court of First Instance in paragraphs 31 to 33 of the order.", "In those circumstances, it cannot submit that its members are economic operators whose position in the market is affected in order to challenge the conclusion of the Court of First Instance in paragraph 37 of the order under appeal that the application is not admissible merely because the aid is passed on to the shipowners by means of the reduction in those members’ wage claims as a result of their exemption from income tax introduced by the fiscal measures at issue.", "81 In those circumstances, the third ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "The fourth ground of appeal", "Arguments of the parties", "82 The appellant submits that, by concluding that it had not been shown that its own interests as a negotiator were liable to be directly affected by the aid resulting from the fiscal measures at issue and by distinguishing its situation in the present case from that of the Landbouwschap, a body governed by public law acting as the representative of the interests of the glasshouse horticulture sector in the Netherlands, in the Van der Kooy case and that of the International Rayon and Synthetic Fibres Committee (CIRFS) in the CIRFS case, the Court of First Instance interpreted those judgments too narrowly.", "83 The appellant submits that its role is that of a negotiator with maritime transport companies and, as such, it negotiates the conditions of employment of its members, and hence the conditions in which the aid granted is transmitted from the Danish State to the recipients.", "In that sense, the appellant fulfils a function similar to that of the Landbouwschap, which negotiated the conditions in which aid was to be transmitted from the Dutch State to the horticultural producers, as the Court of First Instance recognised, in paragraph 40 of the order under appeal, by stating that the appellant played ‘a part in the machinery for passing the aid on to shipowners’.", "Similarly, although the appellant did not negotiate the conditions in the Community guidelines, it nevertheless represents a clearly identified group of Community seafarers which has a special position under those guidelines.", "84 The Commission submits that the fourth ground of appeal should be rejected as unfounded.", "It argues in particular that the Court of First Instance was right to consider that the situation at issue in the present case was not comparable to those in the Van der Kooy and CIRFS cases.", "In those cases the applicant occupied a clearly circumscribed position as negotiator which was intimately linked to the actual subject-matter of the decision at issue, thus placing it in a factual situation which distinguished it from all other persons.", "Contrary to what the appellant alleges, it in no way negotiated the conditions in which the aid resulting from the fiscal measures at issue is transmitted from the Danish State to the recipients of the aid, and it also did not negotiate the conditions in the Community guidelines.", "Findings of the Court", "85 It should be recalled that in Van der Kooy the Landbouwschap had negotiated with the supplier of gas the preferential tariff challenged by the Commission and was also one of the signatories to the agreement establishing that tariff.", "Similarly, on that basis, it had been obliged to engage in new tariff negotiations with the supplier and to sign a new agreement in order to put into effect the Commission’s decision.", "86 In the CIRFS case, CIRFS had been the Commission’s interlocutor with regard to the introduction of a ‘discipline’ concerning aid in the synthetic fibre sector, and also to its extension and adaptation, and had actively pursued negotiations with the Commission during the pre-litigation procedure, in particular by submitting written observations and by keeping in close contact with the responsible departments of the Commission.", "87 According to the Court’s case-law, the Van der Kooy and CIRFS cases thus concerned particular situations in which the applicant occupied a clearly circumscribed position as negotiator which was intimately linked to the actual subject-matter of the decision, thus placing it in a factual situation which distinguished it from all other persons (Case C‑106/98 P Comité d’entreprise de la Société française de production and Others, paragraph 45).", "88 The Court has had occasion to contemplate the application of that case-law in actions seeking the annulment of a Commission decision terminating a procedure initiated under Article 88(2) EC.", "It has held that certain associations of economic operators which have played a significant role in the procedure under that provision must be recognised as individually concerned by such a decision, in so far as they are affected in their capacity as negotiators (see, to that effect, Case C‑106/98 P Comité d’entreprise de la Société française de production and Others, paragraphs 40 to 42).", "89 It also held, when considering the admissibility of the application for annulment brought by CIRFS, that that application should be understood as seeking the annulment of the Commission’s refusal to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 88(2) EC.", "90 It follows that that case-law could be applicable, within the limits specified by the Court, to actions for annulment either of a Commission decision closing the procedure initiated under Article 88(2) EC or of a decision not to raise objections and hence not to initiate the formal review procedure under that provision.", "91 As to the question whether the Court of First Instance erred in law by applying that case-law to the situation of the appellant in the present case, it must be recalled that the contested decision concerned tax measures adopted by the Danish legislature relating to seafarers employed on board vessels registered in the DIS register, that that registration, as appears from paragraph 5 above, allows those seafarers to be paid wages on the basis of their national laws, and that the appellant’s complaint to the Commission concerned the compatibility of those tax measures with the Community guidelines which had been adopted by the Commission without any particular participation of the appellant.", "92 In view of those circumstances, the Court of First Instance did not err in law by considering that the appellant’s situation was not comparable to that of Landbouwschap or CIRFS, situations which it rightly described as altogether special or indeed exceptional.", "The appellant, which is only one of the many trade unions in the European Union representing seafarers, and only one of the many trade unions operating in Denmark, and is not the only representative of seafarers, did not occupy a clearly circumscribed position as negotiator which was intimately linked to the actual subject-matter of the contested decision.", "It was not directly involved in the adoption by the Danish legislature of the fiscal measures at issue to which the Commission decided not to raise objections, its opposition to those measures not being enough for it to be classified as a negotiator within the meaning of Van der Kooy and CIRFS.", "93 Nor was the appellant closely involved in the process by which the Commission adopted the Community guidelines, from which the incompatibility with the common market of the fiscal measures at issue, according to the appellant, is apparent.", "94 The appellant admittedly made a complaint to the Commission against those fiscal measures, but that fact alone, as it admits itself in its appeal, does not enable it to establish a position of negotiator within the meaning of Van der Kooy and CIRFS.", "95 Even if an action for annulment of a Commission decision not to raise objections and hence not to initiate the formal review procedure under Article 88(2) EC is held to be admissible where the applicant shows that he is a party concerned within the meaning of that provision (the stricter criteria defined in the line of case-law following from Plaumann not being applicable in that case), to interpret the case-law cited in the preceding paragraph as referring to any person who has made a complaint to the Commission would amount to depriving of substance the case-law considered in connection with the first ground of appeal and cited in paragraph 30 of the order under appeal, relating to the effect on an applicant’s competitive position.", "96 In the light of the foregoing, the fourth ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.", "The action at first instance", "97 In accordance with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, if the decision of the Court of First Instance is set aside the Court of Justice may give final judgment in the matter where the state of the proceedings so permits.", "98 While the Court is not in a position at this stage of the proceedings to give judgment on the substance of the action before the Court of First Instance, it does, on the other hand, have the necessary information to give final judgment on the plea of inadmissibility raised by the Commission in the proceedings at first instance.", "99 In the light of the particular circumstances of the case, that plea must be rejected.", "100 As regards the adequacy of the elements adduced by the appellant to show, in the circumstances of the case, that the contested decision was liable to have a specific effect on its situation or that of the seafarers it represents, it must be recalled that the appellant is an organisation representing workers which negotiates the terms and conditions on which labour is supplied to undertakings, including the shipowners whose vessels are registered in the DIS register.", "101 According to the appellant, the tax exemption for the seafarers’ wages is justified by the need to offset the greater cost of employing Community seafarers compared to seafarers from non-member countries.", "In that way the objective can be achieved of preserving Community employment, which was one of the objectives of the Community guidelines.", "The social aspects of those guidelines affect the very conditions on which aid may be approved or not approved.", "102 As may be seen from paragraph 70 above, it cannot be ruled out that, as a representative in particular of Danish seafarers, the appellant may be able to submit observations to the Commission on considerations of a social nature which it can take into account, if appropriate, if it initiates the formal review procedure provided for by Article 88(2) EC.", "103 The Community guidelines themselves acknowledge, in the specific context of the reduction of employment costs in the maritime sector, the particular part played by trade union representatives in wage negotiations.", "According to the sixth paragraph of point 3.2 of the guidelines, ‘[t]he alleviation of fiscal burdens would not remove the interest of the shipowner in negotiating an appropriate salary package with potential crew members and their labour representatives.", "Seafarers from Member States with lower wage levels would still, therefore, have a competitive advantage over those from other Member States with higher wage expectations.", "In any event, EC seafarers will continue to be more expensive than the cheapest available in the global market.’", "104 Since the appellant has explained how the fiscal measures at issue could affect its position and that of its members in collective negotiations with shipowners whose vessels are registered in the DIS register, and since the Community guidelines acknowledge the part played by trade unions such as the appellant in those negotiations, it must be concluded that the appellant has shown, to the requisite legal standard, that its interests and those of its members could be affected by the contested decision.", "105 It must also be recalled that the appellant had, in the present case, lodged a complaint with the Commission against the Kingdom of Denmark in respect of the fiscal measures at issue, arguing that they were contrary to the Community guidelines and hence to Article 87 EC.", "While lodging such a complaint with the Commission does not in itself suffice to establish the status of party concerned within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC, it is none the less the case that those measures were not notified to the Commission by that Member State and it was the bringing of the appellant’s complaint which enabled the Commission to examine their compatibility with the common market.", "Furthermore, the Commission took nearly four years to conclude that the measures were compatible, and throughout that time the appellant was in close contact with the Commission.", "106 It must also be pointed out that the present case differs from Case C‑106/98 P Comité d’entreprise de la Société française de production and Others.", "In the latter case the applicants brought an action against a decision of the Commission, which, after initiating the procedure provided for in Article 93(2) of the Treaty, had declared the aid to be incompatible with the common market.", "By contrast, the present action is directed against a decision of the Commission in which, without initiating the formal review procedure provided for in Article 88(2) EC, it found aid compatible with the common market.", "Similarly, in Case C‑106/98 P Comité d’entreprise de la Société française de production and Others the applicants did not take part in the procedure initiated under Article 93(2) of the Treaty, whereas in the present case the Commission did not initiate the formal review procedure, despite the complaint lodged by the appellant and the contact the appellant maintained with the Commission up to the date of the Commission’s conclusion that the measures were compatible.", "107 The situation described with reference to the present case indicates that the interests both of the appellant itself and also of its members may be liable to be affected by the granting of the aid.", "108 In view of the above considerations, the plea of inadmissibility raised by the Commission against the appellant’s application to the Court of First Instance must be rejected.", "The appellant may, in the particular circumstances of the case, be regarded as a party concerned within the meaning of Article 88(2) EC, and its action must consequently be declared admissible.", "109 In those circumstances, the case should be remitted to the Court of First Instance to rule on the appellant’s claim that the contested decision should be annulled.", "On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:", "1.", "The order of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities of 23 April 2007 in Case T‑30/03

(‘Frucona Košice’) seeks to have set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 7 December 2010 in Case T-11/07 Frucona Košice v Commission [2010] ECR II-5453 (‘the judgment under appeal’), by which the General Court dismissed its action seeking annulment of Commission Decision 2007/254/EC of 7 June 2006 on State aid C 25/05 (ex NN 21/05) implemented by the Slovak Republic for Frucona Košice a.s. (OJ 2007 L 112, p. 14; ‘the contested decision’).", "Background to the dispute and the contested decision", "2", "Frucona Košice is a company incorporated under Slovak law which was active in, inter alia, the alcohol and spirits production sector.", "3", "On 25 February 2004, Frucona Košice, which had benefited, in the past, from several deferrals of payment of its tax debt, was unable to pay the excise duties for which it was liable in respect of January 2004.", "4", "Consequently, on 6 March 2004, its licence to produce and process alcohol and spirits was revoked.", "Since then, it has confined itself to distributing, under the ‘Frucona’ brand, spirits bought from an undertaking which, in accordance with an agreement, produced them under licence in the Frucona Košice distilleries.", "5", "Frucona Košice also found itself in a position of indebtedness within the terms of Slovak Law No 328/1991 on bankruptcy and arrangement with creditors (zákon č. 328/1991 Zb. o konkurze a vyrovnaní).", "6", "According to the contested decision, the procedures governing bankruptcy and arrangement with creditors are placed under the supervision of a court, which seeks to resolve the financial situation of indebted companies.", "Whereas the bankruptcy procedure has the result that the indebted company ceases to exist, the arrangement allows it to pursue its activities, leading to an agreement under which the indebted company repays a portion of its debt in return for the balance being written off.", "7", "The general director of Frucona Košice had met, on 16 December 2003 and on 23 and 30 January 2004, representatives of the Slovak Directorate-General for Taxation and the Slovak Minister for Finance, in order, in particular, to propose to them a settlement of that company’s tax liabilities by means of an arrangement procedure.", "8", "On 8 January 2004, that company had also contacted, in regard to this matter, its local tax office, the Košice IV Office (‘the local Tax Office’), which did not object to the drawing-up of an arrangement.", "9", "On 8 March 2004, Frucona Košice filed an application for the initiation of an arrangement procedure before the Krajský súd v Košiciach (Košice Regional Court) (Slovakia), proposing to its creditors to pay each of them 35% of the amount of the sum that it owed to each (‘the proposed arrangement’).", "The total debt of Frucona Košice amounted to approximately SKK 644.6 million, SKK 640.8 million of which was a tax debt.", "10", "By decision of 29 April 2004, the Krajský súd v Košiciach authorised the initiation of the arrangement procedure and, inter alia, reproduced the proposed arrangement.", "11", "In order to enable the local Tax Office to assess the respective advantages of the proposed arrangement, bankruptcy and tax execution, Frucona Košice submitted to it, on 26 April 2004, an audit report drawn up by its internal auditor (‘the K report’) and, on 7 July 2004, an audit report drawn up by an independent audit company (‘the E report’).", "12", "On 21 June 2004, the Slovak tax authorities carried out an on-the-spot inspection at the appellant’s premises.", "In the course of that inspection, they found that, as at 17 June 2004, the appellant had, inter alia, liquid assets amounting to SKK 161.3 million.", "13", "By letter of 6 July 2004, the Director-General of the Slovak Directorate-General for Taxation requested the local Tax Office not to accept the proposed arrangement on the ground that it was unfavourable to the Slovak Republic.", "14", "On 9 July 2004, Frucona Košice’s creditors, including the local Tax Office, accepted the proposed arrangement during an arrangement hearing.", "15", "By decision of 14 July 2004, the Krajský súd v Košiciach confirmed the arrangement and noted, inter alia, that it provided that 35% of the claim of the Slovak tax authorities was to be repaid, that is to say, an anticipated payment of approximately SKK 224.3 million.", "16", "On the same day, the Slovak Directorate-General for Taxation suspended and replaced the director of the local Tax Office and, on 14 December 2004, he was indicted on fraud and embezzlement charges in connection with the local Tax Office’s acceptance of the arrangement proposal.", "By judgment of 6 March 2006, the Špeciálny súd v Pezinku (Special Court, Pezinok) (Slovakia) acquitted him of all charges.", "17", "By letter of 20 October 2004, the local Tax Office indicated to Frucona Košice that the arrangement conditions constituted indirect State aid which was subject to the approval of the Commission of the European Communities.", "18", "On 17 December 2004, Frucona Košice, inter alia, paid to the local Tax Office a sum of SKK 224.3 million, corresponding to 35% of its total debt.", "By decision of 30 December 2004, the Krajský súd v Košiciach declared the arrangement procedure to be terminated.", "On 18 August 2006, the Krajský súd v Košiciach reduced the amount to be paid to the local Tax Office to SKK 224.1 million.", "19", "On 15 October 2004, a complaint was filed with the Commission concerning alleged unlawful aid in favour of Frucona Košice.", "20", "By letter of 4 January 2005, the Slovak Republic informed the Commission, following the latter’s request for information, that Frucona Košice may have been granted unlawful aid and asked it to approve that aid as rescue aid to a company in difficulties.", "21", "After receiving additional information, the Commission, by letter of 5 July 2005, notified the Slovak Republic of its decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure provided for in Article 88(2) EC with regard to the measure in question.", "That decision was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJ 2005 C 233, p. 47).", "22", "On 7 June 2006, the Commission adopted the contested decision, the operative part of which provides, in Article 1 thereof, that the State aid which the Slovak Republic had implemented for Frucona Košice, amounting to SKK 416515990, was incompatible with the common market, and orders, in Article 2 thereof, the recovery of that aid.", "23", "In the part of that decision relating to the assessment of the existence of State aid, the Commission observed that the arrangement contained identical debt-arrangement conditions for both private creditors and the tax authorities, whereas that latter, by virtue of its status as a preferential creditor in the bankruptcy procedure, was in a legally and economically more advantageous position than private creditors.", "24", "The Commission then found that the application of the private creditor test made it necessary to establish whether the local Tax Office was ‘better off accepting the conditions of the arrangement as proposed by [Frucona Košice] compared with the possible outcome of a bankruptcy procedure or a tax execution procedure’.", "25", "In studying the proceeds of a bankruptcy, the Commission took the view that the E report did not constitute a reliable basis as it was founded on the status of Frucona Košice’s assets as at 31 March 2004 rather than on that status, inter alia, as at 17 June 2004.", "The liquidation factors upheld in the E report were thus too low.", "Furthermore, the method of their calculation was not explained.", "In addition, in the light of other available estimations, doubt could be cast on the calculation of the various fees involved in the bankruptcy procedure, to be subtracted from the yield realised by the sale of the assets.", "26", "On the basis of the documents available to it, the Commission concluded that ‘the sale of the assets in a bankruptcy procedure would, in all probability, have led to a higher yield’ than that of the arrangement and that, having regard to the preferential status of the local Tax Office, ‘almost the entire yield obtained in the bankruptcy would accrue’ to it.", "The Commission reached the same conclusion with regard to the yield of a tax execution procedure.", "27", "Subsequently, the Commission pointed out that the Directorate-General for Taxation of the Slovak Republic was opposed to the proposed arrangement and excluded the relevance, for the purposes of the application of the private creditor test, of any long-term interests of the State, such as the continuity of the tax revenue for the State originating from the activities of Frucona Košice.", "28", "The Commission concluded that the test of a private creditor in a market economy had not been met and that the measure under examination therefore constituted State aid equivalent to the amount of the debt written off by the local Tax Office.", "Lastly, it found that that aid was incompatible with the common market.", "Procedure before the General Court and the judgment under appeal", "29", "By application lodged at the Registry of the Court of the First Instance (now the General Court) on 12 January 2007 Frucona Košice sought annulment of the contested decision.", "30", "By document lodged at the Registry of the Court of First Instance on 8 June 2007, the company St.", "Nicolaus – trade a.s. (‘St.", "Nicolaus – trade’) sought leave to intervene in the proceedings in support of the Commission.", "That application was granted by order of the President of the Second Chamber of the Court of First Instance of 11 October 2007.", "31", "In support of its action, Frucona Košice raised 10 pleas, the fourth of which alleged an error of law and of fact on the part of the Commission, which had found, for the purposes of the designation of the measure at issue as State aid, that the bankruptcy procedure was more favourable than the arrangement procedure and that the test of the diligent private creditor had therefore not been satisfied.", "32", "By that plea, Frucona Košice submitted, essentially, that the Commission had failed to take into account, having regard to, inter alia, the evidence which it had produced, the duration of the bankruptcy procedure and its impact on the choice which had to be made by a private creditor in the situation of the tax authorities.", "33", "The General Court, first, held that, since the application of the private creditor test involved complex economic appraisals, the review of the lawfulness of the contested decision had to be restricted to ascertaining whether the Commission had committed a manifest error of assessment.", "34", "Next, it held that, in the present case, it was necessary to take account, for the purposes of that review, of the Slovak tax authorities’ status as a preferential creditor, of the Commission’s particularly cautious assessment of the proceeds from the sale of Frucona Košice’s assets in a bankruptcy procedure, and of the fact that, unlike the arrangement procedure, the bankruptcy procedure did not provide for remission of the debt.", "35", "In the light of those considerations, the General Court held, in paragraphs 123 to 129 of the judgment under appeal, as follows:", "‘123", "First, as regards [Frucona Košice’s] argument that the Commission did not take the duration of a bankruptcy procedure in Slovakia and third party reports in this regard into consideration, the Court would point out first of all that, contrary to [Frucona Košice’s] submission, the Commission not only stated, in recital 54 of the contested decision, that, according to the Slovak Republic, the duration of a bankruptcy procedure would have been lower than average in the light of the specific circumstances of the case, but also mentions, in recital 40 of the contested decision, that, according to [Frucona Košice], the bankruptcy procedure lasts on average 3 to 7 years in Slovakia.", "The Commission stated that [Frucona Košice] based its position on material, statistics and an example of a Slovak company allegedly in a similar situation to its own.", "It cannot therefore be alleged that the Commission ignored that question and [Frucona Košice’s] position in this respect.", "124", "In addition, as regards the evidence available to the Commission, the Court would point out that the data, which were themselves provided by [Frucona Košice], do not satisfy the requirements of reliability and consistency.", "The assessments of the duration of a bankruptcy procedure in Slovakia that [Frucona Košice] submitted to the Commission were general and did not take account of the characteristics of this case.", "Similarly, some of those assessments were of an approximate nature and, to a certain extent, were inconsistent with one another. [Frucona Košice] relies on four reports, referred to in paragraph 96 above, in which that duration was assessed variously at 4 years and 8 months, at a period of between 3 years and 7 years, or at more than 6 years.", "125", "The other reports to which [Frucona Košice] refers are the Commission reports of 2002 and 2003 on the Slovak Republic’s progress towards accession to the European Union. [Frucona Košice] submits that in those reports the Commission referred to the concerns and improvements necessary as regards bankruptcy and insolvency procedures in Slovakia.", "However, it must be pointed out that those Commission reports relate to the bankruptcy procedure in Slovakia in general and do not take account of the characteristics of this case.", "126", "Moreover, the Court observes that [Frucona Košice] failed to refer to the results of the K report in relation to the possible duration of a bankruptcy procedure concerning it.", "In [the K report], which [Frucona Košice] itself submitted in this case, that duration was assessed at “ca. 2 years (depending on conditions and trustee’s work)”.", "The Court would point out that not only was that assessment of the duration of such a bankruptcy procedure clearly much more optimistic than the other assessments submitted by [Frucona Košice] but it also referred specifically to [that company].", "127", "In addition, as the Commission maintains, where, as is the case here, the number of the debtor’s creditors is small and there are assets with a positive liquidation value, the bankruptcy procedure can be carried out in a shorter than average period.", "That is especially true in the present case since it is undisputed between the parties that the Slovak tax authorities’ claim over [Frucona Košice] represented approximately 99% of [the latter’s] liabilities and that those authorities had the status of a preferential creditor.", "It follows that the Slovak tax authorities would have had a decisive influence on the duration of the bankruptcy procedure.", "It is true that [Frucona Košice] asserts that the characteristics, the geographical location and the outdated nature of most of its assets would have made it difficult to find a buyer and, therefore, slowed down the course of the bankruptcy procedure.", "However, as the Commission stated in recital 88 of the contested decision, several factors, and in particular the fact that some of [Frucona Košice’s] production assets found a user after the withdrawal of its licence for the production and processing of alcohol and spirits, tend to show that that assertion ... is unfounded.", "…", "129", "It follows from the foregoing that the Commission did not commit a manifest error in its assessment of the duration of the bankruptcy procedure.’", "36", "Subsequently, the General Court also rejected the other pleas raised by Frucona Košice, consequently dismissing the action brought by that company and ordering it to pay the costs.", "Forms of order sought", "37", "Frucona Košice claims that the Court should:", "—", "set aside the judgment under appeal, in so far as it rejected the fourth and sixth pleas in law;", "—", "uphold those pleas as well founded;", "—", "refer the case back to the General Court so that it may rule upon the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth pleas in law, so far as they concern the tax execution procedure; and", "—", "order the Commission to pay the costs.", "38", "The Commission contends that the Court should:", "—", "dismiss the appeal, and", "—", "order Frucona Košice to pay the costs. 39", "St.", "Nicolaus – trade contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal, confirm the judgment under appeal and order Frucona Košice to pay the costs.", "The appeal", "40", "In support of its appeal, Frucona Košice puts forward two grounds.", "The first ground of appeal alleges that the General Court erred in law in the application of the private creditor test.", "This ground can be divided, essentially, into two parts relating (i) to the duration of a bankruptcy procedure and (ii) to the relevance of experts’ opinions for the purposes of the assessment of the liquidation factors.", "41", "By its second ground of appeal, Frucona Košice alleges that the General Court substituted its own reasoning for that in the contested decision and distorted the evidence.", "This ground can be divided, essentially, into four parts relating (i) to the costs of a bankruptcy procedure, (ii) to the duration of such a procedure, (iii) to the caution in the Commission’s assessment, and (iv) to the relevance of an outstanding claim following that bankruptcy procedure.", "42", "It is appropriate to examine, in the first place and together, the first part of the first ground of appeal and the second part of the second ground of appeal, relating to the duration of a bankruptcy procedure.", "Arguments of the parties", "43", "By the first part of the first ground of appeal, Frucona Košice submits that the General Court erred in law in the application of the private creditor test.", "44", "Frucona Košice takes the view that, in its assessment, the General Court did not examine the situation in the same way as a private creditor would have done, having regard to the information which would have been available to such a creditor at the time when the arrangement was concluded.", "The General Court confirmed an assessment made a posteriori by the Commission which takes no account of certain risks and waiting periods which would have influenced the decision of a private creditor during the examination of the respective advantages of bankruptcy and arrangement procedures.", "45", "Specifically, according to Frucona Košice, the General Court confined itself to examining whether the analysis carried out by the Commission contained errors, and not whether that analysis had been carried out with consideration for the point of view of a prudent private creditor.", "46", "Frucona Košice is of the opinion that that test involves examining whether, taking account of the information which reasonably was available at the time when the arrangement was concluded, the measure at issue was manifestly more generous than the solution chosen by a private creditor in a similar situation.", "47", "Thus, the General Court ought, first, to have determined whether the information on the duration of a bankruptcy could have influenced the decision-making process of a hypothetical private creditor.", "Next, it was for the General Court to ascertain whether the Commission had taken that information into account.", "Lastly, the General Court ought to have examined whether it had given proper weight to that information.", "48", "Frucona Košice considers that, for the purposes of choosing between the different means of recovering a debt, a prudent private creditor would have taken account of the various items of information available in the present case concerning the length of a bankruptcy procedure and the uncertainties connected with that procedure.", "Consequently, the various reports and documents relating to the bankruptcy procedure in respect of the company Liehofruct, which had previously taken place within the same commercial sector, contained, according to Frucona Košice, legally relevant information which the Commission was required to take into account.", "It had failed to do this, thereby committing an error of law which the General Court had failed to censure.", "49", "Frucona Košice states that, in so far as the General Court took the view that the evaluation of the reports compiled by the Commission concerned a question of fact, namely the duration of the bankruptcy procedures, in respect of which the Commission has a margin of discretion, it committed an error of law, the question raised having been that of the impact which that information would have on the assessment which would have been carried out by a prudent private creditor.", "50", "By the second part of the second ground of appeal, Frucona Košice submits that, in respect of the duration of a bankruptcy procedure, the General Court, inter alia, justified, on the basis of its own reasoning, the Commission’s failure to examine those elements.", "51", "In paragraph 123 of the judgment under appeal, it claims, the General Court failed to have regard to the content of the contested decision, since the recitals to which the General Court refers in that paragraph do not purport to express the Commission’s position as regards the duration of the various procedures but record the positions of Frucona Košice and of the Slovak Republic.", "52", "In holding, in paragraph 124 of the judgment under appeal, that the data provided by Frucona Košice did not satisfy the requirements of reliability and consistency, the General Court, in order to reject those arguments, unlawfully supplemented the reasoning set out in the contested decision with new grounds.", "Furthermore, the General Court’s assertion that the Commission had before it several estimates of the likely length of a bankruptcy procedure in Slovakia provides no answer to the arguments set out by Frucona Košice.", "53", "In rejecting, in paragraph 125 of the judgment under appeal, the relevance of the Commission reports of 2002 and 2003 on the Slovak Republic’s progress towards accession to the European Union on the ground that they did not take account of the characteristics of the case, the General Court also put forward an argument on which the Commission had not relied as a basis for the contested decision.", "Moreover, that reasoning is not valid because, when it applies the private creditor test, the Commission often relies partly on general information relating to the economic conditions in the Member State concerned.", "54", "In observing, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, that one of the reports submitted by Frucona Košice estimated the duration of a bankruptcy procedure at approximately two years, the General Court again sought to provide a reason of its own to explain the failure to take into account the duration of a bankruptcy.", "In addition, a duration of two years is still well in excess of the four-month period required in order to obtain funds under an arrangement procedure.", "55", "Likewise, it was solely on the basis of its own reasons that the General Court held, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, that if, in the present case, a bankruptcy procedure had taken place, its duration would have been shorter than the average duration of such a procedure.", "56", "So far as concerns the first part of the first ground of appeal, the Commission takes the view that, in respect of the application of the private creditor test, it is necessary to establish whether the payment facilities granted by a Member State would also have been granted by a private creditor or whether it is clear that such a creditor would not have offered comparable facilities.", "That interpretation is corroborated by the Commission’s discretion when it makes complex economic assessments, such as those which are involved in the application of the private creditor test.", "57", "In the Commission’s opinion, the General Court applied the correct legal test, which consists in establishing whether the public authority has acted in the same way as a private creditor placed in the same situation would have done, in the light of the circumstances, and correctly held that its power of review was limited to revealing manifest errors committed by the Commission in the assessment of the facts.", "58", "Lastly, the Commission contends that Frucona Košice’s arguments relating to the failure to refer to the private creditor test and to the scope of the review by the General Court of the Commission’s assessments concern the manner in which the Commission and the General Court assessed the evidence and thus do not affect the General Court’s reasoning relating to the applicable legal test.", "59", "In respect of the second part of the second ground of appeal, the Commission observes, as a preliminary point, that the assessment of the facts in the light of the private creditor test must be based on an evaluation of all of the relevant factors, whereas Frucona Košice has challenged only the assessment of some of those many factors.", "60", "So far as concerns the duration of the bankruptcy procedure, the Commission observes that, in paragraph 123 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held, in fact, that the Commission had not, in the contested decision, ignored that issue, but had nevertheless held that, having regard to the information in recitals 17, 40 and 54 of the contested decision, it was unnecessary to regard the duration of the bankruptcy procedure as being a factor militating against the conclusion of such a procedure.", "61", "In paragraph 124 of that judgment, the General Court did no more than confirm the evidence which the Commission had before it.", "The reference made by the General Court, in paragraphs 125 and 126 of the judgment under appeal, to reports which are not mentioned in the contested decision is merely an obiter dictum.", "62", "In paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, also, the General Court merely examined the evidence which was before the Commission in order to ascertain whether the latter had made a manifest error of assessment.", "The Commission submits, in this regard, that it is not obliged to respond specifically to every argument put forward by the beneficiary of alleged aid and that it did not develop at length considerations relating to the duration of the bankruptcy procedure since, taking account, in particular, of the local Tax Office’s status as a preferential creditor, the issue would not have been such as to worry a hypothetical private creditor.", "63", "Consequently, Frucona Košice’s arguments raised in the context of the first part of the first ground of appeal, seeking to establish that the General Court substituted its own reasoning for that of the Commission, are unfounded.", "64", "St.", "Nicolaus – trade submits that, for the purposes of applying the private creditor test, the relevant question is whether a private investor would have carried out the transaction at issue on the same terms and, if not, to examine what those terms would have been.", "65", "It observes that, for the local Tax Office, the immediate payment by Frucona Košice of its debt would not have been a necessity at the time when it accepted the arrangement proposal.", "A private creditor in a situation similar to that of the local Tax Office would therefore not have been inclined to relinquish the possibility of having that payment satisfied to a greater extent than that offered under the arrangement.", "66", "In respect of the duration of the bankruptcy procedure, St.", "Nicolaus – trade contends that it is apparent from paragraph 123 of the judgment under appeal that the Commission examined that issue.", "That institution, it submits, has a wide discretion in that regard and, in the present case, it assessed the situation of fact before it principally in the light of the complexity of a bankruptcy procedure, of the number of creditors and of the fact that the tax authorities were not only the majority creditor but also the preferential creditor of Frucona Košice.", "On that basis, the Commission and the General Court were fully justified in concluding that the bankruptcy procedure would most probably have been completed in a shorter period than the period normally necessary for the conclusion of such a procedure.", "Findings of the Court", "67", "Frucona Košice alleges, essentially, that the General Court merely reviewed whether the analysis carried out by the Commission included manifest errors of assessment and that it failed to ascertain whether that analysis had been made from the point of view of a private creditor.", "In particular, it contends, the General Court failed to review whether the available information relating to the duration of a bankruptcy might have influenced the decision-making process of a private creditor and whether the Commission had taken that information into account.", "Instead of carrying out that review, Frucona Košice argues, the General Court justified the failure to examine those factors in the contested decision on the basis of its own reasons.", "68", "Under Article 107(1) TFEU, save as otherwise provided in the Treaties, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods is, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, incompatible with the internal market.", "69", "The concept of aid embraces not only positive benefits, such as subsidies, but also measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which, therefore, without being subsidies in the strict sense of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect (Case C-200/97 Ecotrade [1998] ECR I-7907, paragraph 34, and Case C-6/97 Italy v Commission [1999] ECR I-2981, paragraph 15).", "70", "However, the conditions which a measure must meet in order to be treated as ‘aid’ for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU are not met if the recipient undertaking could, in circumstances which correspond to normal market conditions, have obtained the same advantage as that which has been made available to it through State resources (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 June 2012 in Case C-124/10 P Commission v EDF, paragraph 78 and the case-law cited).", "71", "That assessment is made when a public creditor grants payment facilities in respect of a debt payable to it by an undertaking, by applying, in principle, the private creditor test.", "That test, where applicable, is among the factors which the Commission is required to take into account for the purposes of establishing whether such aid exists (see, to that effect, Case C-342/96 Spain v Commission [1999] ECR I-2459, paragraph 46; Case C-256/97 DM Transport [1999] ECR I-3913, paragraph 24; and Commission v EDF, paragraphs 78 and 103).", "72", "Such  payment facilities constitute State aid for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU where, taking account of the significance of the economic advantage thereby granted, the recipient undertaking would manifestly not have obtained comparable facilities from a private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the public creditor and seeking to recover sums due to it by a debtor in financial difficulty  (see, to that effect, Spain v Commission, paragraph 46; DM Transport, paragraph 30, and Commission v EDF, paragraph 79).", "73", "It is therefore for the Commission to carry out an overall assessment, taking into account all relevant evidence in the case enabling it to determine whether the recipient company would manifestly not have obtained comparable facilities from such a private creditor (see, to that effect, Commission v EDF, paragraph 86).", "74", "It is common ground that  the Commission is required to make a complex economic assessment when it examines whether particular measures can be described as State aid because the public authorities did not act in the same way as a private creditor  (see Case C-525/04 P Spain v Lenzing [2007] ECR I-9947, paragraph 59).", "75", "In this connection, it must be observed that, in the context of the review conducted by the European Union Courts on complex economic assessments made by the Commission in the field of State aid, it is not for those Courts to substitute their own economic assessment for that of the Commission (see, to that effect, Case C-290/07 P Commission v Scott [2010] ECR I-7763, paragraphs 64 and 66 and the case-law cited).", "76", "However,  the European Union Courts must, inter alia, establish not only whether the evidence relied on is factually accurate, reliable and consistent but also whether that evidence contains all the relevant information which must be taken into account in order to assess a complex situation and whether it is capable of substantiating the conclusions drawn from it (Case C-12/03 P Commission v Tetra Laval [2005] ECR I-987, paragraph 39, and Commission v Scott, paragraph 65).", "77", "It follows from the foregoing that, having regard to the arguments put forward by Frucona Košice at first instance, the General Court had to establish, inter alia, whether the available information relating to the duration of a bankruptcy was relevant in the present case for the purposes of an assessment from the point of view of the private creditor test and, if so, whether the Commission took account of it.", "78", "In that regard, all information liable to have a significant influence on the decision-making process of a normally prudent and diligent private creditor, in a situation as close as possible to that of the public creditor and seeking to recover sums due to it by a debtor experiencing difficulty in making the payments, must be regarded as being relevant.", "79", "In the present case, it is common ground that, for the purposes of recovering the sums owed to it, a normally prudent and diligent private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the local Tax Office would have had to make the choice, inter alia, between the proposed arrangement and the bankruptcy of Frucona Košice.", "80", "It follows that, in order to identify the more advantageous alternative, such a creditor would have had to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of each of those procedures.", "81", "As Frucona Košice correctly argues, however, since the duration of the abovementioned procedures postponed the recovery of the sums due and might thus have affected, in the case of lengthy procedures, inter alia, their value, this is clearly a factor which is liable to have a significant influence on the decision-making process of a normally prudent and diligent private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the local Tax Office.", "82", "Consequently, the onus was on the General Court to establish whether the Commission had taken into account, in its assessment of the private creditor test, the available information relating to, inter alia, the duration of a bankruptcy procedure.", "83", "In this connection, it is apparent from paragraph 123 of the judgment under appeal, cited in paragraph 35 above, that the General Court found that the Commission had indicated, in recital 54 of the contested decision, the position of the Slovak Republic as regards the duration of such a procedure, and that it referred, in recital 40 of that decision, to that of Frucona Košice.", "From this it concluded that the Commission had not ‘ignored that question’.", "84", "However, first, the recitals to which the General Court referred are included, as Frucona Košice has correctly pointed out, in Titles IV and V of the contested decision, which summarise the observations of the interested parties and of the Slovak Republic, and not in Title VI, which contains the Commission’s assessment.", "85", "Next, as has been observed in paragraph 82 of this judgment, the onus was on the General Court to establish, not whether the Commission had or had not ignored the available information relating to the duration of a bankruptcy procedure, but whether it had taken that information into account in its assessment of the private creditor test.", "86", "It follows that the General Court ought to have established whether the Commission had devoted part of its reasoning reproduced under Title VI of the contested decision, and in particular under Section 2.1 thereof, relating to the comparison of the arrangement and the bankruptcy, to the duration of a bankruptcy procedure.", "It is, however, not apparent from the judgment under appeal that any such examination was carried out.", "87", "Lastly, in so far as the General Court examined, in paragraphs 125 to 127 of the judgment under appeal, also cited in paragraph 35 above, various factors relating to the reliability and the consistency of the information produced by Frucona Košice during the administrative procedure and in so far as it held that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the Commission was able to find that the duration of a bankruptcy procedure was not liable to influence the decision-making process of a private creditor, it must be observed that the General Court’s examination is not connected with any assessment featuring in the contested decision.", "88", "It follows that, in order to reject the pleas which it was examining, the General Court relied on an assessment of the duration of a bankruptcy procedure that serves to fill a gap in the reasoning for the contested decision by means of grounds which did not form part of that decision.", "By acting in this way, however, the General Court exceeded the limits of its power of review.", "89", "In reviewing the legality of acts under Article 263 TFEU, the Court of Justice and the General Court have jurisdiction in actions brought on grounds of lack of competence, infringement of an essential procedural requirement, infringement of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union or of any rule of law relating to its application, or of misuse of powers.", "Article 264 TFEU provides that, if the action is well founded, the act concerned must be declared void.", "The Court of Justice and the General Court cannot, therefore, under any circumstances substitute their own reasoning for that of the author of the contested act (see Case C-164/98 P DIR International Film and Others v Commission [2000] ECR I-447, paragraph 38, and Case C-487/06 P British Aggregates v Commission [2008] ECR I-10515, paragraph 141).", "90", "It follows from the foregoing that, in having failed to establish whether the Commission had taken into account, in its assessment of the private creditor test, the duration of a bankruptcy procedure, and in having filled, in that regard, by means of its own reasoning, a gap in the reasoning in the contested decision, the General Court erred in law.", "91", "The first part of the first ground of appeal and the second part of the second ground of appeal must therefore be declared to be well founded and the judgment under appeal must consequently be set aside.", "The proceedings at first instance", "92", "In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 61 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, if the Court quashes the decision of the General Court, it may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits.", "93", "In the present case, the Court has the necessary information to give final judgment on the first part of the fourth plea submitted at first instance, relating to the duration of a bankruptcy procedure.", "Arguments of the parties", "94", "By the first part of the fourth plea in law submitted at first instance, Frucona Košice submits, essentially, that the Commission failed to take into account the duration of the bankruptcy procedure and the evidence relating to this which it produced during the administrative procedure.", "A private creditor, however, it argues, would have taken that duration into account and would therefore have preferred to accept the proposed arrangement, given that the bankruptcy procedure would take much longer than that of the arrangement, would thus involve a loss in respect of credit interest as against the proceeds of the arrangement and would thus not ensure the recovery of a sum greater than that offered under the proposed arrangement.", "95", "The Commission contends in reply that, in recitals 40 and 54 of the contested decision, it took account of the duration of a bankruptcy procedure and that, in the circumstances in the present case, it was not necessary to establish precisely the foreseeable duration of such a procedure.", "96", "First of all,  even if that bankruptcy procedure would have lasted a long time, which the Commission disputes, having regard to, inter alia, the opinion of the Slovak authorities and the small number of creditors, it follows from the findings made in the contested decision that the arrangement would in any event have been less advantageous for the Slovak State than the bankruptcy procedure .", "97", "Next, as the local Tax Office enjoyed the status of preferential creditor, since its debt was guaranteed by Frucona Košice’s immovable assets, evaluated by the latter at SKK 194 million and by that office at SKK 397 million, its claims could have been satisfied at any time during the bankruptcy procedure by the sale of the assets constituting the guarantee, in accordance with Law No 328/1991 on bankruptcy and arrangement with creditors.", "Consequently, as regards those assets, the duration of the bankruptcy procedure would have been irrelevant.", "98", "Lastly, Frucona Košice’s calculation is based on a final amount to be received which is significantly less than the real value of the undertaking’s assets, minus the costs of the bankruptcy procedure.", "Since the local Tax Office’s claim represented more than 99% of the registered debt, that office could have expected to receive at least SKK 435 million under that procedure.", "Even taking into consideration the rate of creditor interest put forward by Frucona Košice, if it had been able to recover such a sum, a private creditor would have been prepared to wait for the end of a bankruptcy procedure, even if that procedure were to last for the longest estimated period.", "99", "St.", "Nicolaus – trade supports the Commission’s arguments.", "Findings of the Court", "100", "It follows, inter alia, from paragraphs 78 to 81 above that, in a situation such as that of the present case, the duration of the bankruptcy procedure is a factor which is liable to have a significant influence on the decision-making process of a normally prudent and diligent private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the local Tax Office and that, therefore, the Commission was required to take into account, in its assessment of the private creditor test, the available information relating to, inter alia, the duration of such a procedure.", "101", "It must, however, be stated that Title VI of the contested decision, which contains the Commission’s assessment and, in particular, Section 2.1 thereof, relating to the comparison of the arrangement and of the bankruptcy, do not contain any reference to the duration of such a procedure.", "102", "In so far as the Commission submits that, in the specific circumstances of the present case, it was entitled to find that the duration of a bankruptcy procedure was not liable to influence the decision-making process of a private creditor, it must be noted that, having regard to the arguments and to the evidence produced by Frucona Košice during the administrative procedure and to the matters pointed out in paragraphs 78 to 81 above, the Commission was required to set out in the contested decision, at least in summary form, the considerations which led it to that conclusion.", "103", "It follows from the foregoing that, having failed to take account, in its assessment of the private creditor test, of the duration of the bankruptcy procedure, the Commission committed a manifest error of assessment.", "In so far as that factor was taken into consideration by the Commission, the latter did not set out sufficient reasons for its decision.", "104", "Consequently, the first part of the fourth plea in law submitted at first instance must be declared to be well founded.", "105", "Nevertheless, as the Commission found, in recitals 93 to 99 of the contested decision, that the tax execution procedure was more advantageous for a private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the local Tax Office than was the proposed arrangement, the finding in the preceding paragraph cannot, in itself, lead to the annulment of that decision.", "106", "As the General Court noted in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, it is, by reason of that finding, necessary to examine the other pleas in law raised by Frucona Košice on which it did not rule, including, in particular, those concerning the assessment of the private creditor test so far as that tax execution procedure is concerned.", "107", "It must, however, be held that, so far as that examination is concerned, the dispute is not in such a state as to enable final judgment to be given.", "Consequently, the case must be referred back to the General Court for it to give judgment on the pleas raised before it on which it did not rule.", "Costs", "108", "Since the case is being referred back to the General Court, it is appropriate to reserve the costs.", "On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby:", "1.", "Sets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 7 December 2010 in Case T-11/07 Frucona Košice v Commission;", "2.", "Refers the case back to the General Court of the European Union for it to give judgment on the pleas raised before it on which it did not rule;", "3.", "Reserves the costs."], "doc_id": "A2013_Frucona Košice a.s. v European Commission"}
